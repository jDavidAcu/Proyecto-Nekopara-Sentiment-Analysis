NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a very short but cute and sweet visual novel. It is a kinetic novel that uses the E-Mote system much better than in some other works that I've read (notably Study Steady).

" This visual novel is fairly bare bones past the E-Mote system. There's only a few BGM used, and not a lot of CGs are used. However, what it has it uses pretty well.

"[h1]Is this game worth it without the 18+ DLC?[/h1]  I would say so.  More specifically, I would say the game had enough of a plot (or at least a series of random though somewhat related events that appeared in sequence, but in a fun way) and the characters had enough personality to them to enjoy for its own sake, and there is some meaning to this besides [i]just[/i] being an excuse for naughty moments.  [h1]My personal random ramblings[/h1]  Enough of me pretending to be helpful to other players, now it's time for me to vent about my experience playing the game. You may as well stop reading here, because the rest of this review somewhat doesn't matter (though I guess it does mildly touch upon certain things that happen in the game, but honestly the main takeaway here is just ""Playing without the 18+ DLC doesn't mean it's suddenly family friendly, it's just more like 17+ instead"").  So, to start with, the way I even heard about this game in the first place was that occasionally I'll check old forum threads where people are recommending games in categories I'm interested in or I'll look through interesting curator lists and stuff looking for new ideas for games to play, and a name that kept popping up over and over was Nekopara, Nekopara. The title alone didn't seem that interesting at first glance, so I just ignored it, but the name just kept popping up over and over in different places, Nekopara, Nekopara, and this was mentioned far more than most games to the point where I finally decided to see what it was everyone was going on about, and I look and, eh, it's just some catgirl game, nothing that special, really.  Still, there's a demo, so I may as well try it out just to see what all the fuss is about, and normally I'm the kind of guy who plays a demo for 90 seconds and if the game hasn't captured my interest by then I just quit and move on, but this time I was going to take it super seriously because this was a big big demo in my mind, not just for this random game that the entire ""young lonely anime obsessed male"" population seems to adore, but also a demo for essentially the entire ""Because you don't have a girlfriend, here's an anime girl instead"" (not that I'm trying to be unkind to the playerbase here, but it's certainly true that I don't have a girlfriend and I played this game, and that should say enough) visual novel genre as a whole, because looking into the genre, a lot of other games looked vaguely as interesting as Nekopara but didn't have demos and so if what I assume is one of the most popular and therefore likely best games in the genre didn't seem interesting I'd just forget about those other ones too.  So, I'm playing the demo, and it's good or whatever, I guess, and then I get to the end (equivalent to the end of chapter 1 in the full game) when Chocola is telling generic protagonist that she wants to stay with him, and I admit I rather enjoyed that scene and I thought the backstory when the catgirls were younger was cute and I thought it was really really sweet the way Chocola loves her master so much, and, yeah, it was a bit heavy handed and they didn't have to say 700 times that these were her true honest feelings, but still, it was probably better to go too heavy than too light there and so I enjoyed it and so fine game you win and I'll wishlist you.  A little later I eventually get around to buying the full game, and I'm playing it without the 18+ DLC, and I must say my general impression with adult games (mostly because I'd heard about a couple of RPG's where it's apparently possible to do a pure run, but I guess maybe I shouldn't generalize that sort of thing) was that there will often be a choice to watch a naughty scene with little impact on the plot or just skip it, and I thought I had even noticed a point in the demo where such a choice might occur, because there's a point where the catgirls are asking generic protagonist to take a bath with them and he says no without any input from the player but I had figured at the time that maybe if you were playing the full game and had the 18+ DLC you'd have the opportunity to say yes there for a naughty scene if you'd like, and I just figured the whole game would be like that with mostly normal goings on interspersed with random smut occasionally, but then actually playing, uhh... no, that's not the game at all, and the smut is baked into the main plot here and most noticeably a whole big thing is made out of the catgirls going into heat and desperately needing a partner as a flimsy excuse for generic protagonist to say ""I guess it can't be helped"" and heading off to satisfy them, and without the 18+ DLC we don't actually see this happen but the game just skips to them lying in bed afterwards, but it's still implied, and honestly it was personally a bit of a disappointment for me because I'm the kind of guy who when they care for a character wants to see them stay pure and innocent, but at least my girls seemed happy about it, I guess. I just hope generic protagonist continues to take good care of them.  More than that, though, I was surprised by how much stuff made it into this game even without the 18+ DLC: There's a scene of generic protagonist washing off the catgirls after an incredibly forced situation to get them dirty that any idiot should have seen coming a mile away and that generic protagonist should have known to stop well in advance, but my point is the girls are totally naked here and there's a full illustration for it, and, yeah, due to the angle and some convenient steam and stuff nothing ""interesting"" is visible here, but it was still really hot and I enjoyed it anyway and I still wouldn't want my mom to see that image as my desktop background.  Also, there's weirdly a scene of one of the catgirls, well... ""having a good time by herself"", let's call it, and I have no idea if that scene might be more explicit with the 18+ DLC or something, but as I saw it, there was no special illustration or anything but just the usual character model with its arms extending beneath the bottom of the screen suggestively and some obligatory moaning and whatnot, but that was still more than I was expecting here.  Also, there's a scene of two of the characters talking about reproduction, which mostly centers around plants, but one of the characters is getting way too into it and drooling at the thought and stuff anyway.  Random thing, but generic protagonist's little sister kept making weird inappropriate comments to him, and it wasn't a major element to the story and I don't [i]think[/i] she was serious, but I still thought that felt weird, not just without the 18+ DLC, but just in general because although I realize that we who are into brother-sister stuff are not an insignificant group in the lonely young guys community, I also realize that there are plenty of people who aren't and such a taboo tends to be rather strong (not to mention she's specifically referred to as a kid at least once), and so I thought it a strange choice to include that in the game for such little reason and potentially alienate some of the players who were just here for the totally normal human on animal action (seriously, a fairly big deal is made about how catgirls are seen more as cat than girl, and I noticed in the Japanese text at least once them being referred to with a counter for animals, and it seems strange to me that if you wanted to have relations with catgirls that you would do so with a mindset that focuses more on the cat than on the girl) rather than the somehow less normal brother on sister lack of action (because for the record, generic protagonist isn't into the stuff his sister says, but he'd rather she knocked it off).  Also, there's a gratuitous double panty shot.  Anyway, near the end there's a scene where the catgirls are threatened with arrest while trying to help their master, and I thought their dedication to him was sweet there too.",h1is this game worth

But, as far as the visuals go, it definitely delivers: the characters are all adorable, the artstyle is a treat, and the story is cute, fun and lighthearted.

"I don't like leaving negative reviews but I feel like I have to for this one. Strap in, It's a frustrated one.  For those who don't want to read the whole thing, I can summarise this [strike] game [/strike] Visual novel (Seriously, why does it not have the tag visual novel (as a main tag)):  [h1] Shallow [/h1]   I will be honest and say I don't like visual novels in general, so you might ask me why would I even bother buying this? Well, It was and still is popular and well liked, I did really like ddlc, and I like erotic material. I figured when seeing it in a bundled sale of all volumes that I might like it and perhaps that it could even change my mind on visual novels. REST ASSURED, It reinforced my aversion.  [h3] The good [/h3] - The voice actresses are good from what I can tell, but I don't speak Japanese so take that as you will. - I like the art. It's well made apart from 2 nitpicks that I will mention later.  [h3] The bad (not 18+) [/h3] - The story is so shallow. I guess the best way to describe the story is interpersonal relationships between the protagonist and the catgirls + sister. That is all. What does this mean for the story? Well, it means that there is practically nothing going on. When the story works up to something, the chapter ends and the goal has been achieved off screen. Phenomenal. - It's a visual novel, I know, but it should still be mentioned: there is 0 interactibility. None. Forget replay value, there isn't even ANY playing. - Any shallow or minimal conflict there is, will be resolved within max. 10 sentences. - The book is about 6-7 hours on auto-play (with 18+). Considering there is no reason to replay this or the fact that it is just reading, €9,75 is quite a lot to ask. SIKE, to get this full time you need the 18+ patch which costs ANOTHER €9,75 for a total of €19,50. - The story doesn't respect your time. What is told, could be done in 3 hours probably. - The MC is a dolt, I dislike him. - I know this is a nitpick, but hear me out. One of the painted backgrounds, the one that shows the front of the store, has an opening sign that states: 'opem'. There aren't many backgrounds, it's a simple word, the only focus for this product is writing, the art, and voice acting. Frankly, there is no reason to have such a basic mistake. - 90%+ of the story is just happy go lucky. (Maybe somewhat individual criticism, but it feels off)  [h3] The bad (18+) [/h3] - I hope you like bleeding eardrums, because that is the main 18+ experience. The exceptionally whiny and earpiercing 'wails' will drive you up a wall. Lowering your volume won't help due to the high pitch of the voice actresses. - From what I understand the dialogue is very much Japanese style... They want it but still will say stop, no and stuff... yuck. - Something that has always bothered me about hentai, let's describe literally everything in excruciating detail. They just don't know when to shut up. - I hope you like censoring. The good animated scenes are utterly worthless as a result, you can't even see anything (apart from nips). Honestly, just look up the 6 gifs online, it might even be a better experience. - I hope you like repeating sentences that are only minimally altered. (x4) - The official patch for the 18+ material is another €9,75! Are you out of your mind? To be honest, it's somewhat my mistake to think it was included. Yes, the game is practically known for the funneh 18+ stuff but let it be known, it costs extra.  [h1] To conclude [/h1]  I feel like my review was more articulate than the slideshow I paid for. Keep your money, it isn't worth the sweet catgirl tiddies.  There are enough of those and 100x better quality online for free.",i dont like leaving negative reviews but i feel like i have to for this one strap in its a frustrated one  for those who dont want to read the whole thing i can summarise this strike game strike visual novel seriously why does it not have the tag visual novel as a main tag  h1 shallow h1   i will be honest and say i dont like visual novels in general so you might ask me why would i even bother buying this well it was and still is popular and well liked i did really like ddlc and i like erotic material i figured when seeing it in a bundled sale of all volumes that i might like it and perhaps that it could even change my mind on visual novels rest assured it reinforced my aversion  h3 the good h3  the voice actresses are good from what i can tell but i dont speak japanese so take that as you will  i like the art its well made apart from 2 nit that i will mention later  h3 the bad not 18 h3  the story is so shallow i guess the best way to describe the story is interpersonal relationships between the protagonist and the catgirls  sister that is all what does this mean for the story well it means that there is practically nothing going on when the story works up to something the chapter ends and the goal has been achieved off screen phenomenal  its a visual novel i know but it should still be mentioned there is 0 interactibility none forget replay value there isnt even any playing  any shallow or minimal conflict there is will be resolved within max 10 sentences  the book is about 67 hours on autoplay with 18 considering there is no reason to replay this or the fact that it is just reading 975 is quite a lot to ask sike to get this full time you need the 18 patch which costs another 975 for a total of 1950  the story doesnt respect your time what is told could be done in 3 hours probably  the mc is a dolt i dislike him  i know this is a nit but hear me out one of the painted backgrounds the one that shows the front of the store has an opening sign that states opem there arent many backgrounds its a simple word the only focus for this product is writing the art and voice acting frankly there is no reason to have such a basic mistake  90 of the story is just happy go lucky maybe somewhat individual criticism but it feels off  h3 the bad 18 h3  i hope you like bleeding eardrums because that is the main 18 experience the exceptionally whiny and earpiercing wails will drive you up a wall lowering your volume wont help due to the high pitch of the voice actresses  from what i understand the dialogue is very much japanese style they want it but still will say stop no and stuff yuck  something that has always bothered me about hentai lets describe literally everything in excruciating detail they just dont know when to shut up  i hope you like censoring the good animated scenes are utterly worthless as a result you cant even see anything apart from nips honestly just look up the 6 gifs online it might even be a better experience  i hope you like repeating sentences that are only minimally altered x4  the official patch for the 18 material is another 975 are you out of your mind to be honest its somewhat my mistake to think it was included yes the game is practically known for the funneh 18 stuff but let it be known it costs extra  h1 to conclude h1  i feel like my review was more articulate than the slideshow i paid for keep your money it isnt worth the sweet catgirl tiddies  there are enough of those and 100x better quality online for free,NEU,0.5996729135513306

"[h1] Can be an Adult Game [/h1]  Nekopara Vol. 1 introduces players to a charming alternate reality where catgirls, or 'Neko,' seamlessly integrate into everyday life. These Neko possess human female bodies with adorable feline features like ears, tails, and subtle mannerisms. The story centers on Kashou Minaduki, a young man who departs from his family's traditional confectionery business to pursue his passion for baking. However, his plans are delightfully derailed when two of his family's loyal Neko, the energetic Chocola and the serene Vanilla, stow away in his belongings and follow him to his new home.  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a visual novel, meaning its focus is entirely on narrative delivery. Players should expect a linear experience with no branching storylines or gameplay elements beyond progressing the text and enjoying the accompanying visuals and music. The game excels in its lighthearted, slice-of-life storytelling, showcasing the endearing interactions between Kashou and the Neko. The narrative explores themes of independence, found family, and the challenges of adapting to a new life, all wrapped in a sugary-sweet package. While the premise is undeniably cute, it also sparks a degree of thoughtful contemplation. The game subtly raises questions about the societal implications of integrating non-human beings into everyday life, prompting players to consider the potential complexities of such a scenario.  It's important to note that Nekopara Vol. 1 contains suggestive themes and imagery. While the base game is generally suitable for mature teenagers, an optional adult patch is available for purchase, which significantly increases the explicit content. Therefore, a recommended age rating of 16+ for the base game and 18+ for the adult version is appropriate. Overall, Nekopara Vol. 1 serves as a delightful and engaging introduction to the Nekopara universe. Its charming characters, appealing art style, and lighthearted narrative make it a pleasant experience for fans of visual novels and those seeking a relaxing, feel-good story. It's a promising start to a unique and a new IP.  [h1] The game isn't an adult game without buying the adult patch from Steam or other ways.

"[h1] A sweet, lovely classic, with copious amounts of spice! (8/10) [/h1] (• Played with R18 Patch)  Yes, this is 10 years old and I’m late on jumping on the train. But personally I still think it holds up quite well in most regards. If you want to start delving into JPVNs with romcom and SOL elements, and want to see what the fuss is all about, I’d say this is still a fine title to consider! Doubly so if you appreciate catgirls (you should, they’re cute) or maid uniforms!  I do feel like everything is pretty surface level in terms of how the relationship develops and how the story progresses, but from a technical perspective, this is a very well-polished game that focuses on having brilliant art and VA at the very least. The start can also feel a bit weird / wishy-washy, especially how cold and distant Kashou seems to the girls at times in the first few chapters, but I guess it’s there for the sake of character development.  It also felt somewhat formulaic, in the sense that MC ends up being nice a bit to a girl for a little sweet talk moment, then [spoiler]they go in heat and smell something sweet off MC as a sign.[/spoiler]. Happens to Chocola, then soon after happens to Vanilla. Of course, there are other story beats outside of this, but these two being strung together back-to-back made it feel slightly repetitive, on top of the fact that “[i]come on, anyone could literally say that[/i]”.   Of course, them being catgirls is the saving grace that might let me suspend my disbelief a little bit and assume they are clingy and easily attached by nature. And also maybe this obvious disbelief is why devs released Vol 0 AND Vol Extra; to give more substantial reasoning to the romance that unfolds here, since based on the synopsis of those, they felt like Chocola and Vanilla needed to be given more limelight.  The game also features Shigure, the somewhat lovestruck little sister/trainer/’other real owner’ of the catgirls. Her scenes are fun, but her existence makes me go “[i]another one of these, huh[/i]”. Despite my limited knowledge in this sphere I know how notoriously somewhat-common it is to have a sister chara who crushes on MC. And I know some people would rather [i]not deal with that stuff[/i] so I thought it’s worth mentioning. It is pretty fine here though, since everything is one-way and MC doesn’t indulge her too much. But looking at the info about the upcoming game “After”, it is somewhat likely that she’ll be a slowburn, final LI.  The end scene is pretty heartfelt, although I notice some odd details in how [spoiler]the cop literally doesn’t care that there’s a very sick dude being out late at night and needing help.. They literally said “[i]alright I’mma head out.[/i]”[/spoiler] Literally tunnel-vision and doing the bare minimum, but I guess that’s par for the course for background characters.  The epilogue also very rightfully teases the fact that [spoiler]other catgirls are moving in too[/spoiler], so I’m looking forward to slowly trying the rest of the bundle!  [h3]Information:[/h3]  [b](•)Playtime Total: 7h10m13s[/b]. I don’t cut VA and am generally not rushing. Took me 1h until intro video, 1:28:0 until Bath CG, and 3:14:29 until first H CG.  From my timings, the [b]H scene accounts for 2 hours exactly[/b]. ([spoiler]35m for Chocola, probably also ~35 for Vanilla, and 50m for final scene[/spoiler])  [b](•)Kinetic Novel.[/b]  [b](•)A tinge of Yuri.[/b] Yes, they may be “[i]indulgent, male-gaze-enabling[/i]” kissing art, but it’s technically there nonetheless. Although Chocola & Vanilla treat each other more like dependent twin sisters (as they are), they seem to really love each other.  [h3](+) Pros/General Ratings:[/h3]  [b](+) Writing (7/10).[/b] I mean it’s just slice of life so nothing mindblowing, but it was fun to read. There’s some okay worldbuilding too with laws, narration describing the population at large accepting catgirls as companions, etc. . At least it’s a bit more than the bare minimum.  [b](+) Godly tier art (9/10).[/b] People are here for the anime CGs, myself included, and it did not disappoint. Of course I’m partially swayed by the fact that lots of what I saw are H Scenes, but even if you’re playing without patch, there’s also some beautiful date CGs here or them very cutely eating cake. There’s also a lot of cut-in images that makes things decently expressive; more than I initially expected. I do wish we got a few more of the girls actually in the kitchen doing work, but it is what it is.  [b](+) Lovely girls (7.7/10).[/b] Chocola and Vanilla are very good girls. They’re very earnest, and the sense of distance Vanilla brings to the table actually intrigues me quite a bit. Of course, they’re also cute in their own ways. It does sometimes feel like they’re very simple mass-appeal charas though; but maybe simple truly is the best!  [b](+)Animated Sprites[/b]. Some of the pauses in movement can feel a bit awkward and dated, but the fact that it’s mostly animated is nice.  [b](+) Good Voice Acting (8/10).[/b] Yep. Not much to be said except nice production value. I don’t know much about who’s-in-what, but at least I noticed Coconut sharing VA with Ditzy Demons’ Miyabi (Tezuka Ryouko) and I really love her voice. [strike]Guess that’s why I gotta get in on the sequels[/strike]. Chocola exudes real lovey-dovey sweetness. The whole cast is solid really.  [h3](-) Cons:[/h3]  [b](-) Still some typos.[/b] Yep. Even for something [u]this popular and 10 years old[/u], there’s still a couple of lines with missing words and wrong words. Although it’s rare enough that I feel like it’s better than some other newer titles, but it’s surprising that this is the case, considering the current landscape of other non-JPVN games being updated and fixed for typo issues. Maybe no one cares to report them for JPVNs and I won’t either, but I’ve done my part for some other titles at least. I’d figure this was popular enough that some would surely have already done it over time, but I guess not!  [b](-) Text Display jank.[/b] Sometimes text just shows a single word for me and the line stops loading entirely or advancing. Bringing up the backlog in these cases show the full line, but going back to the line shows the incomplete one. Dunno what is causing this on my end but it happens, in both cases of previous line being advanced via auto-play vs manual clicks. I do often re-enable and disable it via the auto play button, and have different text speeds between manual clicks & auto play despite basically doing both depending on whether the current line is voiced or not, so maybe that causes issues, but it’s annoying how unpolished this feature seems to me.  I guess it was par for the 2014 time and my expectations are colored by more modern, newer-year releases feeling smoother in this regard. I expected something this beloved to differentiate between Auto mode Text Speed vs Auto Mode Wait Time (how long to advance once the line is fully outputted) too as an aside, but I guess back then no one realizes these two could be different sliders.  [b](-) Deleting save files just causes the game to crash.[/b] ??? “Invalid Value / Time & Date” prompt shows up before the game closes on me… my brother.. why is that even relevant. I have no idea.  [b](-) Steam Screenshots during the bath H-CG doesn’t show text even if you want it to.[/b]I guess some publishers do some special stuff during these to avoid getting into problem with steam formerly (fine); and hence do some kind of censoring in intent, but in implementation something ended up going wrong. The only thing that gets hidden is the actual textbox/backlog while fully showing the CG in full display.  Of course, the actual H scenes will result in pixellated screenshots and that’s pretty standard in my limited experience. But still an oddity how the bath CG differs.  [h1]Overall, pretty standard and I’d still humbly somewhat recommend it![/h1]",h1 a sweet lovely classic with copious amounts of s 810 h1  played with r18 patch  yes this is 10 years old and im late

"I'm replaying trough the Nekopara series for the second time now, and I felt like leaving a more elaborate review to anyone that might be interested in giving it a try.  [b] Nekopara Vol.1 [/b] is the first slice of a Visual Novel series about life with catgirls (and also running a patisserie). Each volume (game) moves the story forward and focuses on a different pair of catgirls, and this one is all about Chocola and Vanilla.  Reading trough the VN you can expect a very fun slice of life story, lovable and charismatic characters, amazing art with lively animated sprites, a great soundtrack, a lewd-cute romance and even optional NSFW content (included on the paid +18 dlc). If you enjoy any of this stuff, I recommend this VN for you!  Note that this is a linear VN, meaning that you don't have any dialogue or action options, and also meaning there's no character routes, so just sit back and enjoy the reading.  The story is divided into 8 chapters, and if I have to explain them, each one could be compared to an anime episode. I personally found it enjoyable to finish a game session in the end of a chapter, and then resume playing in the start of the next one.  [b] Nekopara Vol.1 [/b] has a free demo that includes all of chapter 1, so you should at least give it a try!",im replaying trough the nekopara series for the second time now and i felt like leaving a more elaborate review to anyone that might be interested in giving it a try  b nekopara vol1 b is the first slice of a visual novel series about life with catgirls and also running a patisserie each volume game moves the story forward and focuses on a different pair of catgirls and this one is all about chocola and vanilla  reading trough the vn you can expect a very fun slice of life story lovable and charismatic characters amazing art with lively animated sprites a great soundtrack a lewdcute romance and even optional nsfw content included on the paid 18 dlc if you enjoy any of this stuff i  this vn for you  note that this is a linear vn meaning that you dont have any dialogue or action options and also meaning theres no character routes so just sit back and enjoy the reading  the story is divided into 8 chapters and if i have to explain them each one could  to an anime episode i personally found it enjoyable to finish a game session in the end of a chapter and then resume playing in the start of the next one  b nekopara vol1 b has a free demo that includes all of chapter 1 so you should at least give it a try,POS,0.8897039294242859

"By definition this isn't a game. It's more like an animated comic strip. I feel that this product being listed under games is misleading and should be sold as a simple animated manga. Also the rating is unfair. Nothing about anything I've seen would be considered 'Hentai'. While some of the conversation does discuss having sex the manga shows nothing inappropriate and aside from a few incestual comments from one or two characters the conversations are obscure enough to not be out of place.

"There comes a time in every man's life when he needs to look in the mirror and ask himself how exactly he got to that place. You have to truly reflect on the decisions you have made along the path that led you to the place of your final reckoning.  It's still not clear, even to me, why I bought this game. There's nothing wrong with it, with those nudity scenes it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize how damaged I and the rest of humanity are.  What prompted me to buy a game like this? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it? When I look into the infinite depths of my own loneliness, I see a pool of reflection. My face is not there, there is no face. There are only tears in that puddle, tears of shame, loss and confusion.  If it were up to me again, I know I would buy it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip the countless window prompts so I could get a single bite of the pornographic images that are available online. However, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I chose to purchase this game and dedicate hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and like time I fear never to find it again.  There is something broken inside me, something that desires sensations beyond my reach, something that moans every night knowing that there is no real princess, it is simply an illusion. In my quest to find meaning in this long life, I searched for the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop-up window on my computer.

"I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A HENTAI! But that didn't matter as the full game is apparently locked behind DLC. (According to the negative reviews.) It had like maybe 2 kind of nudity scenes, but nothing was showing. Bless my eyes!  I didn't know anything about Nekopara when putting it into my wishlist. I saw the cute character designs and that it was a visual novel. Was blind to the tags. My husband bought me all the Nekoparas on a huge sale. Wish I played and discovered how I felt sooner so my husband could have gotten his money back. I'm sorry, Kenu!  Now I know this game is not targeted towards me with it being a hentai. I'm not going to review the game for it's NSFW.  The Problems:  1. The story is very bland and dialogue wasn't that interesting.  2. Listed as a visual novel, but has no dialogue options. 3. The catgirls literally act like cats in a human body. Could be a hentai thing, but I don't feel the need to f**k my cat. 4. Voice acting was cringe when they tried to act like cats. 5. The lore of the catgirls being pets, but can also be lovers is disgusting. Basically you are owning someone and for pleasure while they also happen to be your pet (bonus point: they can't get pregnant either to add to the fantasy).  6. It seems like they were trying to go for an innocence approach for Chocola and Vanilla (the main catgirls), but they come off as acting like 8 year olds. I believe they are still underage even in cat years. 7. The MC viewing Chocola and Vanilla as daughters and helped raised them, but still has sex with them. Even thinking that after sex too! Pedo behavior.  8. When Chocola goes into heat, Vanilla pressures the MC to have sex with her. Even saying that catgirls can get ill if not satisfied during this time.  9. Little sister lusts hard after the MC. And letting the MC get frisky with her pets. 10. Why is having sex with your pet a normal and okay thing in this world?  Good things about this product: 1. Character designs are great. Especially the contrasting colors for Chocola and Vanilla for being twins. 2. Voicing acting was good when they were not speaking like cringey cats. 3. Backgrounds are very polished and nice to look at. 4. Dialogue is very easy to read. (But still uninteresting.) 5. The art is gorgeous and probably the best selling point.",i didnt know this was a hentai but that didnt matter as the full game is apparently locked behind dlc according to the negative reviews it had like maybe 2 kind of nudity scenes but nothing was showing bless my eyes  i didnt know anything about nekopara when putting it into my wishlist i saw the cute character designs and that it was a visual novel was blind to the tags my husband bought me all the nekoparas on a huge sale wish i played and discovered how i felt sooner so my husband could have gotten his money back im sorry kenu  now i know this game is not targeted towards me with it being a hentai im not going to review the game for its nsfw  the problems  1 the story is very bland and dialogue wasnt that interesting  2 listed as a visual novel but has no dialogue options 3 the catgirls literally act like cats in a human body could be a hentai thing but i dont feel the need to fk my cat 4 voice acting was cringe when they tried to act like cats 5 the lore of the catgirls being pets but can also be lovers is disgusting basically you are owning someone and for pleasure while they also happen to be your pet bonus point they cant get pregnant either to add to the fantasy  6 it seems like they were trying to go for an innocence approach for chocola and vanilla the main catgirls but  off as acting like 8 year olds i believe they are still underage even in cat years 7 the mc viewing chocola and vanilla as daughters and helped raised them but still has sex with them even thinking that after sex too pedo behavior  8 when chocola goes into heat vanilla pressures the mc to have sex with her even saying that catgirls can get ill if not satisfied during this time  9 little sister lusts hard after the mc and letting the mc get frisky with her pets 10 why is having sex with your pet a normal and okay thing in this world  good things about this product 1 character designs are great especially the contrasting colors for chocola and vanilla for being twins 2 voicing acting was good when they were not speaking like cringey cats 3 backgrounds are very polished and nice to look at 4 dialogue is very easy to read but still uninteresting 5 the art is gorgeous and probably the best selling point,NEU,0.8239044547080994

This review is for the whole Nekopara series on steam.  Pros -great art -extremely moe -decent voice acting -cute slice of life story -little sister has a brother complex  Cons -no decisions / story branches -auto mode sometimes skips multiple lines of text -bad pacing -the split into multiple volume means entering your settings every volume and CGs are split between different games as well as paying for each volume including the three different paywalls to the H scenes -each volume is short enough to be read in one sitting -cant romance the sister  There's really not much to say about this. It was a good time reading it but there were no decisions basically making the save menu useless. This makes it feel like a shit manga with voice acting and awkward character animations. This game is pure moe trash which i love but if i'm paying for moe trash i want more out of it like in other visual novels with branching story lines or like in the neptunia series where you get a full game and moe trash. If i wanted to read and look at cute anime girls i would read manga (for free).   Worst of all there is no romancing the little sister and no little sister H scene.

"09pm  I am a 54 year old mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my daughter, who is now 15. My daughter recently started Nekopara in less than a week, she had already played for over 12 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my daughter, as she is always out with her friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my daughter since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought my daughter and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories! 😊",09pm  i am a 54 year old mother probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single mother to my daughter who is now 15 my daughter recently started nekopara in less than a week she had already played for over 12 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my daughter as she is always out with her friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside her i loaded into the game but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my daughter since my husband had died this game has ever since brought my daughter and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories,NEG,0.5097246766090393

"ok so first, I didn't go into this game thinking it was a porn game. I genuinely thought it was just a visual novel. So, I'll be reviewing it as one.   The Pros: the art, voice acting, and design of the game are put together very well. The art is super cute (besides the lewd stuff which is super nasty imo)   The Cons: HORRIBLE writing. Genuinely the characters are SO annoying, the worldbuilding makes no sense either. AND not to mention the incest shit?? You have a little sister who's obsessed with you AND you're like the father of the catgirls? But you have sex with them?? It's just so messed up. Gross sex shit aside, it's near impossible to actually play the game. I can't get over the oddly worried dialogue. It's so hard to read.   So in conclusion, if you're kinda weird and looking for a solid sex game, go for it I guess? But, if you're looking for an actual visual novel please stay away.

" Chocola: Chocola is one of the two poster catgirls for the NEKOPARA series, and her personality is built to shine in that role. Chocola is outgoing and ditzy in nature, being the second youngest of the Minaduki Household, Chocola is shown to lack a sense of direction, and blindly follows her intuition, heart, and of course, her Master. She is presented as one of the deuteragonists of the series along with her sister, Vanilla, and together they wreak havoc day in and day out. She is not very good at dealing with complicated matters, and tends to lean away from serious topics with quick topic changes and feigned ignorance. Those around her perceive her as clumsy and uninsightful, when she is instead a strong willed and inspired catgirl determined to help those around her. Chocola was abandoned at a young age and taken in by Kashou (MC) & Shigure (MC's Sister). The character development from her starting as a scared, young soul, and developing into the shining star catgirl at La Soleil is a great decision, as she takes over co-lead at La Soleil. Throughout the games we are shown time and time again why Chocola is so strong willed and is always willing to fight for what she thinks is right. Chocola's go with the flow attitude makes her shine in almost every major plot-point throughout the series as she is not afraid to speak her mind, even if she isn't the most insightful while doing so. Chocola is a happy-go-lucky catgirl who even when sad, can be swung by a simple change of scenery of topic, although she is capable of being genuinely sad at points (As shown while they try and convince Kashou to let them stay at La Soleil). While she most definitely loves her sister, her love is not as outwardly displayed as Vanilla's to Chocola which is a nice contrast differing from both of their character's normal styles of interaction. The two later entires that come first in the series, Vol. 0, & Extra both help expand on why Chocola loves her Master (Kashou) so much. They detail how he helped them settle in to the Minaduki household and made them feel safe by taking time out of his days to spend with them. The story of Vol. 0 follows Chocola trying to cope with not being able to see her Master as much, as he is working on his Patisserie skills. This plot-point, while developed later, does help tie up lose ends to the story as to why they wanted to follow Kashou to the point of shipping themselves in boxes across to his new shop.",chocola chocola is one of the two poster catgirls for the nekopara series and her personality is built to shine in that role chocola is outgoing and ditzy in nature being the second youngest of the minaduki household chocola is shown to lack a sense of direction and blindly follows her intuition heart and of course her master she is presented as one of the deuteragonists of the series along with her sister vanilla and together they wreak havoc day in and day out she is not very good at dealing  matters and tends to lean away from serious topics with quick to and feigned ignorance those around her perceive her as clumsy and uninsightful when she is instead a strong willed and inspired catgirl determined to help those around her chocola was abandoned at a young age and taken in by kashou mc  shigure mcs sister the character development from her starting as a scared young soul and developing into the shining star catgirl at la soleil is a great decision as she takes over colead at la soleil throughout the games we are shown time and time again why chocola is so strong willed and is always willing to fight for what she thinks is right chocolas go with the flow attitude makes her shine in almost every major plotpoint throughout the series as she is not afraid to speak her mind even if she isnt the most insightful while doing so chocola is a happygolucky catgirl who even when sad can be swung by a simple change of scenery of topic although she is capable of being genuinely sad at points as shown while they try and convince kashou to let them stay at la soleil while she most definitely loves her sister her love is not as outwardly displayed as vanillas to chocola which is a nice contrast differing from both of their characters normal styles of interaction the two later entires  first in the series vol 0  extra both help expand on why chocola loves her master kashou so much they detail how he helped them settle in to the minaduki household and made them feel safe by taking time out of his days to spend with them the story of vol 0 follows chocola trying to cope with not being able to see her master as much as he is working on his patisserie skills this plotpoint while developed later does help tie up lose ends to the story as to why they wanted to follow kashou to the point of shipping themselves in boxes across to his new shop,NEG,0.6693373918533325
" Vanilla: Vanilla is simply amazing. She is Chocola's identical twin, and almost all of her personality involves being exactly that. She follows Chocola as if it her job, and her only goal in life is to make sure that Chocola is happy, while staying with her. The two twins of the Minaduki household could not be more different in nature; while Chocola is energetic and upbeat, Vanilla prefers the more laid back approach, while still maintaining similar tastes as her sister. Similar to Chocola, Vanilla does not like serious topics, but chooses to use quick witted humour and distraction tactics as opposed to feigning ignorance to avoid such discussions. She is often portrayed as the more responsible of the pair, and always seems to be in the right place at the right time. As she is Chocola's twin sister, she too was taken in by the Minaduki household after being abandoned by their previous owners. Having such a similar upbringing to Chocola makes them share a lot of similarities, but their personal tastes and styles could not be more different. Chocola's happy go lucky attitude starkly contrasts Vanilla's sharp wit and ""I'll do things my way"" style of living. The want for independence but strong need to be next to her sister makes her the most ""Catlike"" of the 6 main catgirls. Vanilla's nature extends to how she acts, even around her family. She struggles to express emotions and maintains a monotonous voice throughout every entry of the series. This causes her to be often misunderstood as she is quite intelligent and oftentimes makes the most realistic comparisons and insights. The later released Vol. 0 and Extra versions continued to explain her complex backstory, showing her intelligence stemming from a young age, although she was not as prevalent as most of the other catgirls in those two entries.

"So I'm only on chapter 3, so I will update when I get further in the game! I'm gonna make this a serious review though, so.  Here's the things I like about this game so far: - The sprite art is really cute (Usually, will elaborate later) - The game has cat logic down to a pretty solid degree. - It's pretty cute watching Chocola and Vanilla going around being Chocola and Vanilla. - The other art in the game is also very pretty, from backgrounds to CGs and outfit design. - *Great* use of onomatopoeia everywhere  Here's what I don't like, though: - Major ambiguity on Chocola and Vanilla's ages. I get it that they age differently than both cats and humans, but the ambiguity between whether they're adults or children is way too major at times. - Kashou often says that Chocola and Vanilla are like daughters or little sisters to him, which feels weird considering how the game wants you to sexualize them. - Kashou often infantilizes Chocola and Vanilla, which feels weird sometimes when they act younger. - The sprites are really well done! But sometimes when Chocola's eyes go wide when she's looking at you head-on, she looks *really* uncanny. This is usually not the case when Chocola's head is at a 3/4ths angle. Sometimes when Vanilla looks to the left at Chocola when her head is at a 3/4ths angle, her eyes look like they're looking in two different directions.  I'll mark this review as recommended, but this game really isn't something I would recommend to just anyone.

"[h3]TLDR at the bottom for those who respect their own time.[/h3]  I'm a huge sucker for all things cute and the art for the Nekopara games is adorable!  The plot however..? [i]Eh...[/i] The relationship between Kashou and his catpanions really could have used more development as there's hardly any chemistry between them (literally the only reason they end up in a relationship is because the catgirls go into heat, like that's pretty much it.) I feel as if the characters never got to grow, both as individuals and in their relationships with each other, it's a bit of a shame, really, but maybe that's not what NEKO WORKs was trying to accomplish, and that's okay. Still, i was hoping for that ""Oh thank GODS they finally kissed!"" moment, which i was left a bit disappointed, as i'm sure it would have very much enriched the overall plot and enhanced the [i]""plot""[/i] scenes.  Speaking of... the """"PLOT"""" here is of fine quality; the art is stunning and erotic af, the music suits the mood, and the voice acting really sells it (No other comments, easy 8.5/10 macaroons.)  Also, can we talk about the music? Like yeah yeah it does it's job of setting the tone for the game rather well, but tracks like Cat Work and Nya Soliel are straight up bangers! Great for easy listening and perfect for vibing to while snacking on your favorite pastry. (also also, there's a titty elasticity meter, do with that as you will but it's not really my kind of thing lol.)

NSFW content [/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacie/recommended/947650/] here[/url].  🔥HOT🔥 Nekopara Vol. 1 is a japanese voice acted visual novel (English, Chinese, Japanese subtitles) which is the first entry in the Nekopara series of visual novels. This game follows Kashou, who opens his confections shop after moving out of home. Little does he know, when unpacking boxes he finds two of his families catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla. Despite his best efforts, Chocola and Vanilla stay in the shop and work together to run the shop.  The game has 7 main characters (Excluding the MC) which are introduced at the start of the story, being the two catgirls who are the focus of this volume, Chocola and Vanilla - alongside your sister Shigure and her four catgirls, Cinnamon, Coconut, Azuki and Maple. Shigure is the only character besides Chocola and Vanilla who appears multiple times throughout the story. Shigure's catgirls only make two appearances, one for introduction to the characters and the other for eluding the second game's [spoiler] introduction to the rest of the girls working at the cafe, Patisserie La Soleil (Nicknamed Neko Paradise at the end of the VN.)[/spoiler]. This game took me 2.5 hours to read, although for a slow reader can take about 5 hours to read. The game has adjustable text speed which also allowed me to read faster, with using both auto and manual reading at just shy from the fastest text speed.   Without getting into spoilers, the game focuses on the relationship which forms between the two cats, Chocola and Vanilla and their backstory, obtaining bells (simply catgirl citizenship) alongside their relationship with Kashou. The game also slightly delves into some of Shigure's story - although this isnt fully explored. The artwork for the game is very high quality, having both opening and endings (with their own unique songs!), scene segway cards and CG's. The writing for the game is quite standard for a visual novel, using words you'd expect for an anime style VN, nothing outstanding in this department.   Overall, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a high quality visual novel which with it's lovable cast which gets you invested in their stories and high production quality in bot it's SFX & artwork, I can certainly recommend this for both visual novel novices or experienced readers.",h1this review was written by h1 h1  hot or not reviews url h1 h3 if you liked this review make sure to give us a follow h3  b note my playthrough was played with the nsfw dlc my gameplay experience therefore may differ from yours b b see my review for the nekopara vol 1 nsfw content b  hereurl  hot nekopara vol 1 is a japanese voice acted visual novel english chinese japanese subtitles which is the first entry in the nekopara series of visual novels this game follows kashou who opens his confections shop after moving out of home little does he know when unpacking boxes he finds two of his families catgirls chocola and vanilla despite his best efforts chocola and vanilla stay in the shop and work together to run the shop  the game has 7 main characters excluding the mc which are introduced at the start of the story being the two catgirls who are the focus of this volume chocola and vanilla  alongside your sister shigure and her four catgirls cinnamon coconut azuki and maple shigure is the only character besides chocola and vanilla who appears multiple times throughout the story shigures catgirls only make two appearances one for introduction to the characters and the other for eluding the second games spoiler introduction to the rest of the girls working at the cafe patisserie la soleil nicknamed neko paradise at the end of the vnspoiler this game took me 25 hours to read although for a slow reader can take about 5 hours to read the game has adjustable text speed which also allowed me to read faster with using both auto and manual reading at just shy from the fastest text speed   without getting into spoilers the game focuses on the relationship which forms between the two cats chocola and vanilla and their backstory obtaining bells simply catgirl citizenship alongside their relationship with kashou the game also slightly delves into some of shigures story  although this isnt fully explored the artwork for the game is very high quality having both opening and endings with their own unique songs scene segway cards and cgs the writing for the game is quite standard for a visual novel using words youd expect for an anime style vn nothing outstanding in this department   overall nekopara vol 1 is a high quality visual novel which with its lovable cast which gets you invested in their stories and high production quality in bot its sfx  artwork i can certainly  this for both visual novel novices or experienced readers,NEU,0.9051334261894226

"Look, don’t think too hard about it.  Nekopara is a kinetic (linear story) visual novel featuring a lot of cute cat girls with about a length of 6-7 hours.   The story itself is fine, there were some good moments in it but no way is anyone actually playing this just for that. The art / visuals on the other hand are great and is definitely what carries the series. Voice acting is good as well, they do a great job with their characters. As a special mention, I really liked the UI / menu design, it fits the theme and is easy to navigate.  If you like cute things, great. If you like catgirls, even better. If you feel ashamed at yourself by buying this remember, there are over 22,000 reviews on this game here on Steam as of writing this. It doesn’t matter if they’re all joke reviews, that’s still a lot.  If you end up enjoying Nekopara, more power to you.

"What a cute visual novel! There are so many things I love about it. It's definitely not perfect, as I found myself extremely uncomfortable by the incest themes and the ethics of the ownership of the catgirls. However, the pros outweigh the cons for me. The music is one thing that really stood out to me. It's always an important factor in a visual novel in my opinion, but it really stood out here. The voice acting was also just so good! Additionally, I really fell in love with the aesthetics; the art style is very cute with detailed sprites (with animation that I don't often see in VNs that really brought the characters to life) and the CGs were simply beautiful. Also, the general bakery/cake and maid themes are so moe! Finally, I must praise the game for its UI. One thing I love in a VN is its ability to be customised to the preferences of the player and this game has a very good settings page, allowing you to adjust to your comfort. Plus the P button and bounciness setting was enjoyable  ^.^",what a cute visual novel there are so many things i love about it its definitely not perfect as i found myself extremely  by the incest themes and the ethics of the ownership of the catgirls however the pros outweigh the cons for me the music is one thing that really stood out to me its always an important factor in a visual novel in my opinion but it really stood out here the voice acting was also just so good additionally i really fell in love with the aesthetics the art style is very cute with detailed sprites with animation that i dont often see in vns that really brought the characters to life and the cgs were simply beautiful also the general bakerycake and maid themes are so moe finally i must praise the game for its ui one thing i love in a vn is its ability to be customised to the preferences of the player and this game has a very good settings page allowing you to adjust to  plus the p button and bounciness setting was enjoyable,POS,0.99125075340271

"[h1] NEKOPARA: Catnip for the Curious, and Well... More! [/h1] Welcome to the whimsical world of NEKOPARA, where catgirls reign supreme, and the plot takes a backseat to, well, some purr-plexing assets! 🐾  If you're in it for the feline-friendly fun, this visual novel will have you questioning whether you're a true cat lover or simply an enthusiast of...round shapes. Yes, we're talking about the NEKOPARA characters' ample assets. The creators have clearly decided that the cats in this game got more than their fair share of milk because, seriously, those proportions are nothing short of awe-inspiring.  The catgirls themselves are a sight to behold, and not just because of their adorable ears and tails. NEKOPARA boldly goes where few cat-based stories have gone before, putting the 'ecchi' in 'meowchii.' The bouncy physics of certain anatomical features could easily rival a trampoline park – talk about defying the laws of gravity with a furry twist!  The narrative is like the catnip that keeps you coming back for more, weaving a tale of patisseries, sisterly love, and a generous helping of double entendres. But let's be honest, the real stars of the show are the characters'...umm, personalities. They're just so well-rounded!  So, if you're looking for a game that embraces the philosophy of ""plot over plot,"" and you have a penchant for catgirls with, shall we say, impressive assets, then NEKOPARA might just be the purr-fect match for you.

"i think my zaibatsu awakened when i saw chocola on catnip. why was she doing all that for green shit? i dont understand and i feel like op should explain. i do not want to google shit in the middle of nekopara. the reason for this is because i have to suppress my emotions. my emotions are that i want to break chocola's nose. preferable with a metal bat. i do keep a metal bat next to the balcony, where i play nekopara. this would cause me to break my laptop with said metal bat. i may also hurt myself, as i do not wear clothes when playing the game. as a side note, nekopara has directly caused me to recieve police visits for many accounts of indecent exposure. i did feel bad as the game was immersive and did make me feel like i was apart of the nekoverse. i felt exposed when i was not wearing clothes and takoyaki cat was on screen. this is because she looks like a child, but it was ok because in those beady lifeless eyes i dont think she is seeing shit. therefore i dont think she is seeing my 2 millimeter defeater. but in all honesty, it did make me feel better when playing with pathched content because i felt like i finally had something down there. this is why to all my dear nekos out there i reccomend playing in vr. overall i would reccomend because for the 7.9 hours i have play this shit my confidence has went up 18%. i even went as far as being confident enough to play this in my local park. unfortunately, i am not allowed to be naked in my park either. this caused many controversy among my neighbors as i have received death threats from certain gun owners. this is okay because they will never be able to take my nekos away. anyways, i do reccomend the game ( again ). you should play it, and if you have enough willpower, with your clothes on.  mrnekodead out",i think my zaibatsu awakened when i saw chocola on catnip why was she doing all that for green shit i dont understand and i feel like op should explain i do not want to google shit in the middle of nekopara the reason for this is because i have to suppress my emotions my emotions are that i want to break chocolas nose preferable with a metal bat i do keep a metal bat next to the balcony where i play nekopara this would cause me to break my laptop with said metal bat i may also hurt myself as i do not wear clothes when playing the game as a side note nekopara has directly caused me to recieve police visits for many accounts of indecent exposure i did feel bad as the game was immersive and did make me feel like i was apart of the nekoverse i felt exposed when i was not wearing clothes and takoyaki cat was on screen this is because she looks like a child but it was ok because in those beady lifeless eyes i dont think she is seeing shit therefore i dont think she is seeing my 2 millimeter defeater but in all honesty it did make me feel better when playing with pathched content because i felt like i finally had something down there this is why to all my dear nekos out there i  playing in vr overall i would  because for the 79 hours i have play this shit my confidence has went up 18 i even went as far as being confident enough to play this in my local park unfortunately i am not allowed to be naked in my park either this caused many controversy among my neighbors as i have received death threats from certain gun owners this is okay because they will never be able to take my nekos away anyways i do  the game  again  you should play it and if you have enough willpower with your clothes on  mrnekodead out,NEG,0.8638104200363159

"Some negative experiences, you just have a speech lined up for. Because something wonderful or at least interesting was on the line, and you want to vent the loss of the baby with the bathwater.  But for Nekopara? This kinetic visual novel that has just taken Steam by storm?  It has been a while since I have met something that somehow manages to be so underwhelming and uninteresting and yet quite so disgusting. Such so, that I don't even feel much need to copy-paste most of the copious notes I've taken as to why this is one of the most noxious, revolting, dislikable pieces of trash I've ever entertained on my hard drive.  But let me share a few.  There are major incestuous themes or at least implications that go unpunished, even presented as wholesome or pleasant; the ""catgirls"" are *nothing* like cats - the things in this VN are way too friendly, loyal, and affectionate to have *anything whatsoever* to do with felines - and there is generally an atmosphere and worldbuilding core of abuse in glittery paint. Aside from the incest, or at least incest-coded interactions, these human girls with cat features are ""owned"", living as slaves, as living playthings, and it's played up as this wholesome thing. And the writers have the gall to try to push some BS that they're actually more cat than human, ""because ears and tail."" It's like an excuse for a right-wing political policy; so stupid and insufficient to allay the elephant in the room it's supposed to explain away, delivered so confidently and unapologetically it either forces you to go along with it or sickens you to your gut. Or both.  __  But okay, let's say you're kind of feeling in the mood for an ""Arabamu"" lewd setup and you think the Emancipation Proclamation was a mistake. Well, what's wrong with Nekopara then?  Plenty, frankly. The story is underwhelming and uninteresting, just a day-by-day with no evident stakes and it basically being anime people doing anime things until you get to lewd scenes. I'd be up for a slice-of-life, if it's interesting, but Nekopara isn't.  The characters themselves, which are supposed to be the meat of the experience, apparently, get redundant and annoying, really fast; their interactions and dialogue might be bearable, even sparsely likable, in a different sort of VN, but for a game wie're here for the lewds for and we know it? And one *THIS LONG*? They're just obnoxious and don't add anything interesting to the plot or social atmosphere.  Speaking of lewd? Perhaps the biggest outrage of all is that it's not even in here, by default. You have to pay the whole price of the VN again, just to see what is probably only two or three scenes that I bet I could easily look up on a seedy website if I wanted to. It's insulting. Yes, I dislike that the dialogue seems to be incest-coded, but if you're going to put that in a game you are expressly selling for its lewd content, at least have the stones to double down and put your lewd content in as part of the main, whole purchase, lock, stock, and barrel.  Oh, did I say game? Excuse me. This isn't even a game. It's a ""kinetic visual novel"". There's no option to interact with the story or characters in any way. This just plays in one direction, with the same outcome, each time. This is basically a porn video if you ever thought ""gee, I sure wish these porn videos had *more* talking heads, had most of their action in subtitles, and that I had to regularly click to make it play instead of clicking the once and just watching"" - oh, and where you have to buy the video, then buy it *again* to see the actual *porn* in it.  And for gosh sakes, even the worldbuilding isn't worth a dime. The aforementioned genetic excuse they pull out of their ass for the girls' being cats is just the tip of the iceberg. There are stupid rules about the arrest of these ""cat"" girls, a ""family"" of eight somehow surviving on a singular traditional candy shop...  For hell's sake, even though this takes place in a bakery, and the Kashou guy presents himself as being all qualified and set up as a proper baker, through and through, I am convinced he's a fraud. He calls a Sponge Cake batter a ""dough"".an eyebrow-raiser but forgivable.  But wrapping it up and saving it for later!? WRAPPING! UP! *SPONGE CAKE*! BATTER! and SAVING IT FOR LATER!? I am in an Advanced Baking course as I type this (just got back, a bit of a coincidence now that I think about it) and this is one thing we DO NOT DO WITH SPONGE CAKES!  ___  If this were some obscure niche VN tucked in Steam's dark corners, maybe I wouldn't feel this angry. But the fact this is so popular that Steam expressly merchandises animated avatar images and other things about it, and its pics are all over the place for anything to do with lewd games or sci-fi cartoon girls to date? That is insulting. There are a hundred games that deserve stardom more than this - NSFW and SFW alike.  If you really want to spend ten - or depending on how desperate you are, twenty- dollars on a frustrating ghost of an experience when you could buy much better ones for five dollars or see a much longer one for free, go for it.

"People who only watched the anime: aw, what a cute and wholesome story. People who played the VNs: do they know?  [h1] Introduction [/h1]  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a slice-of-life visual novel, and it's the first of a series of four visual novels (excluding the prequels, Nekopara Extra and Nekopara Vol. 0). It even has an anime adaptation for those who want to check it out. Being a slice-of-life story, it isn't a plot driven story by any stretch of the imagination, but this means that the characters need to be likable at the very least. Lets see if there are any merits to this game.  [h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]  Surprisingly, the worldbuilding of this game is solid and consistent. The game is set in modern Japan, and has similar, if not the same, rules of the real world. The difference is that catgirls are a thing. As a side note, some people think catgirls belong to the category of furry, which is wrong. Catgirls belong to kemonomimi, which are human, save of the animal ears. The game describes very consistently the characteristics of catgirls, the rules to which they abide and their influence on human society. The only gripe I have with the worldbuilding is that those elements are described mostly through exposition dumps instead of dialogue that flows naturally with the story and the characters. Another thing I noticed is that the absence of catboys, because the game establishes that catgirls can get pregnant, but not through a human, so that means that catboys must exist, but they are never mentioned. Something to think about.  [h1] The plot (or lack thereof) [/h1]  The story is simple. It's about a pastry chef that wants to open and run his own bakery, in opposition to what his parents wanted, and a very peculiar kind of employees join him to work at said bakery. Then the story focuses on the relationship between the two star catgirls and his new owner. Overall, the writing is solid, but not stellar, but there is a plot hole at the end of the story in which a character says something that contradicts something they previously said, and that facilitated the drama that followed. The pacing was good and the tonal shifts were spot on. The dialogue is good overall, but... why dialogue during H-scenes is so cringy? I may never know.  [h1] The characters [/h1]  The characters of this game, save one, are static, and, in the context of a slice-of-life story, it isn't a bad thing. The thing that matters is that the characters are consistently characterized and need to have distinct personality traits. Note that the names of the catgirls are always of ingredients used regularly in bakery. There are in total six catgirls (plus one that is a side character), but the main subjects of this story in particular are Chocola and Vanilla. They are very endearing characters. Chocola is a catgirl who wear her emotions on her sleeve and it has a very upbeat personality. Vanilla is more subdued but her deadpan jokes and the way she conceals what she really feels is, like I said, endearing. Regarding the main character, Minaduki Kashou (he will become a very, very lucky guy), undergoes a small change, because he wanted to run his bakery on his own, showing his selfishness, but then he accepted the help of Chocola and Vanilla. Shigure, his younger sister, is a total brocon. I'll leave it at that. Overall, the characters, especially Chocola and Vanilla, are very likable characters, but Kashou can be a bit boring at times.  [h1] Presentation [/h1]  The art direction is in the middle of the pack. Not bad, but not excellent either. Character artstyle, though, is very good, whether be in event CGs or the animated models, and the animations are very well done, expressive and life-like, and the way the ears of the catgirls perked up or drooped based on their emotional state is a nice little detail, plus, it looks very cute. The voice acting is also very good, the music fits the tone and the situation nicely, and the H-scenes are also excellent, though I wished that the scenes were at 60 fps, because in every other situation, the game ran at the same framerate as the refresh rate of my monitor (165 fps in the case of my gaming laptop and 240 fps in the case of my gaming PC). The player can also change between Traditional Chinese, English and Japanese text on the fly. The game also gives the player the option to adjust jiggle physics. Nice. Push ""P"" to see the effects.  In conclusion:  [b] Pros: [/b]  -Soild worldbuilding, with small exceptions. -Endearing and likable characters. -Good presentation overall (including H-scenes)  [b] Cons: [/b]  -Some plot issues at the end of the story. -Main character can be a bit boring. -At 10 hours, is a bit too short for the price (base game and 18+ DLC).  So, all in all, the game has enough merits to earn my recommendation. If you expected good storytelling in this game, then you are looking in the wrong place. Slice-of-life stories don't need traditional storytelling, only cute and likable characters doing cute things (and some extremely lewd things in this case), and this game delivers on that regard. Also, the presentation is worthy of praise, but I strongly recommend to wait for a good discount on the base game and the 18+ DLC, so you can get more for your money.",people who only watched the anime aw what a cute and wholesome story people who played the vns do they know  h1 introduction h1  nekopara vol 1 is a sliceoflife visual novel and its the first of a series of four visual novels excluding the prequels nekopara extra and nekopara vol 0 it even has an anime adaptation for those who want to check it out being a sliceoflife story it isnt a plot driven story by any stretch of the imagination but this means that the characters need to be likable at the very least lets see if there are any merits to this game  h1 worldbuilding h1  surprisingly the worldbuilding of this game is solid and consistent the game is set in modern japan and has similar if not the same rules of the real world the difference is that catgirls are a thing as a side note some people think catgirls belong to the category of furry which is wrong catgirls belong to kemonomimi which are human save of the animal ears the game describes very consistently the characteristics of catgirls the rules to which they abide and their influence on human society the only gripe i have with the worldbuilding is that those elements are described mostly through exposition dumps instead of dialogue that flows naturally with the story and the characters another thing i noticed is that the absence of catboys because the game establishes that catgirls can get pregnant but not through a human so that means that catboys must exist but they are never mentioned something to think about  h1 the plot or lack thereof h1  the story is simple its about a pastry chef that wants to open and run his own bakery in opposition to what his parents wanted and a very peculiar kind of employees join him to work at said bakery then the story focuses on the relationship between the two star catgirls and his new owner overall the writing is solid but not stellar but there is a plot hole at the end of the story in which a character says something that contradicts something they previously said and that facilitated the drama that followed the pacing was good and the tonal shifts were spot on the dialogue is good overall but why dialogue during hscenes is so cringy i may never know  h1 the characters h1  the characters of this game save one are static and in the context of a sliceoflife story it isnt a bad thing the thing that matters is that the characters are consistently characterized and need to have distinct personality traits note that the names of the catgirls are always of ingredients used regularly in bakery there are in total six catgirls plus one that is a side character but the main subjects of this story in particular are chocola and vanilla they are very endearing characters chocola is a catgirl who wear her emotions on her sleeve and it has a very upbeat personality vanilla is more subdued but her deadpan jokes and the way she conceals what she really feels is like i said endearing regarding the main character minaduki kashou he will  a very very lucky guy undergoes a small change because he wanted to run his bakery on his own showing his selfishness but then he accepted the help of chocola and vanilla shigure his younger sister is a total brocon ill leave it at that overall the characters especially chocola and vanilla are very likable characters but kashou can be a bit boring at times  h1 presentation h1  the art direction is in the middle of the pack not bad but not excellent either character artstyle though is very good whether be in event cgs or the animated models and the animations are very well done expressive and lifelike and the way the ears of the catgirls perked up or drooped based on their emotional state is a nice little detail plus it looks very cute the voice acting is also very good the music fits the tone and the situation nicely and the hscenes are also excellent though i wished that the scenes were at 60 fps because in every other situation the game ran at the same framerate as the refresh rate of my monitor 165 fps in the case of my gaming laptop and 240 fps in the case of my gaming pc the player can also change between traditional chinese english and japanese text on the fly the game also gives the player the option to adjust jiggle physics nice push p to see the effects  in conclusion  b pros b  soild worldbuilding with small exceptions endearing and likable characters good presentation overall including hscenes  b cons b  some plot issues at the end of the story main character can be a bit boring at 10 hours is a bit too short for the price base game and 18 dlc  so all in all the game has enough merits to earn my  if you expected good storytelling in this game then you are looking in the wrong place sliceoflife stories dont need traditional storytelling only cute and likable characters doing cute things and some extremely lewd things in this case and this game delivers on that regard also the presentation is worthy of praise but i strongly  to wait for a good discount on the base game and the 18 dlc so you

"This game is absolutely horrendous. Pretty much any visual novel can be expected to be fetishistic an stereotypical, but this is a fine example of these issues. There are numerous instances where the dialogue suddenly feels extremely stilted because some sexual implication is brought up out of nowhere, and especially when mentioned by one of the more innocent characters, these jokes and impications feel extremely out of place. Obviously it's an ecchi/18+ game, but you shouldn't have to throw innuendos into every single conversation like that. Literally a moments thought about this universe's logic reveals how actually fucked up it is. I mean, you essentially OWN other human beings - or at the very least, sentient beings who are shown to be pretty much equally capable to humans given the right environment. There's also the extremely obvious incestuous obsession of the MC's younger sister, which by the way, they do no efforts to excuse, even specifically stating that she is A. blood related and B. quite a bit younger than the MC in another game. An speaking of age gaps, did i mention that Vanilla and Chocola are cannonically NINE MONTHS OLD? They also act basically like children, and it's clear from the dialogue that they have only recently reached sexual maturity, so they are probably 16 year-olds in human years AT BEST. In addition, MC also raised them and is said to veiw them like younger sisters. Literally how much creepier can you get? Oh right, they are also legally his possesions. EW. So yeah, this game is absolutely the worst I have ever, EVER played.  That being said, they are all incredibly cute and god i want their wardrobes so bad.

"When I played Vol. 0, I made the joke that I had many unanswered questions regarding the existence and status of catfolk in this world. I fully expected it to just be glossed over or handwaved, to be honest. Now I just feel like a fool.  Imagine my genuine surprise when the mental checklist of out-there, absurd worldbuilding requests I planned to joke about was slowly ticked off throughout the game. Things like the view of catfolk/human relationships, the rate of aging, catfolk's status in society, whether or not catfolk and people can reproduce, etc. Why would a cutesy eroge bother even mentioning any of this, I thought? Hence why my absurdist review would mark that as a faux complaint. But it's all there, and as subtly horrific as it should be. And I love that.  In all seriousness, it's very cute. The ero scenes are whatever, I'd honestly say not to bother spending the extra cash on em if you're on the fence about it.

"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2022 from his uncle so we installed it on  and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game  my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,NEU,0.8146430253982544

I do wish there were some more interactive elements to this game (choices like in dating sims or interactions with characters like in other h-games).   My issue is that the two main catgirls (Chocola and Vanilla) refer to themselves in the third person all the time and it annoys the shit out of me. Also, Shigure, as the main character's little sister is really.. a bit much. The rest of the catgirl crew is pretty neat and I do look forward to maybe learning more about them in future games.

"Hail fellow gamers, the name's Kiba Snowpaw, a devoted ice wolf from the frozen reaches of an ice world! Gaming for more than three decades now, with an anime and manga collection that can outshine any library's manga section, I'm here to give you my take on a game that's been sending chills down my icy fur. Also, let's clear something up first - I'm not a stranger to the ""birds and bees"", nor the ""wolves and does"", if you catch my drift. With plenty of action in the igloo (wink wink), this review, despite the game's nature, isn't written out of frustration or desperation. 😏❄️🐾  Nekopara has been on my radar for some time now. My experiences on Patreon, Kickstarter and Bandcamp, supporting indie developers' dreams with substantial investments, all funnel into my evaluation. This isn't just another notch on the bedpost; it's a passionate night with a new partner, a game that's opened up a new world of enjoyment.  Diving straight into the nitty-gritty, this game's an eroge, or an erotic game for the uninitiated. Yes, it does come with steamy scenes that might put the heat on my icy world, but that doesn't mean it lacks content elsewhere. As a hardcore gamer with a knack for an immersive storyline, let me tell you - Nekopara knows how to weave a tale.  You're in charge of a bakery and have the company of adorable anthropomorphic catgirls (referred to as Nekos) who, by the way, are wonderfully brought to life with exquisite animation. The game, with its captivating characters, pleasing music, and lively voice acting, does an excellent job of recreating the atmosphere of a bustling bakery. And, a little pro tip for my fellow eroge adventurers out there: there's a boob bounce slider that defies physics if you want it to. Just sayin'... 🎮🐱💕  Now, it's easy to get lost in the... ahem... physical aspects of Nekopara. But, let's not forget about the intriguing plot that pulls the heartstrings at the right moments. These Nekos aren't merely human-feline hybrids bred for amusement. They come with their own histories, dilemmas, and insecurities. The game's society deals with complex issues such as abandonment, compliance tests, and GPS tracking that add depth to this supposed erotic escapade. It's a unique amalgamation of dystopia, ethics, and human-feline relationships.  Given the darker undertones, Nekopara might make you question the reality of this seemingly utopian world. It's akin to a cute, fuzzy, and sexy version of Brave New World meets The Handmaid's Tale.  However, folks, let's remember that at the end of the day, it's a game, and a darned good one at that. I've navigated the plains of Azeroth, conquered the universe in Mass Effect, fought off the Covenant in Halo, and Nekopara stands proud in this illustrious company. Why? Because it does something different and pulls it off spectacularly.  There's a special place in my heart (and my Steam library) for games that offer something more than just mindless action or soulless erotica, and Nekopara is one of them. The art, story, and interaction all combine to make a game that's worthy of the hundreds, if not thousands, of hours you'll lose within its world. 🐾💗🎮  So, whether you're an eroge veteran like yours truly or a curious newcomer, Nekopara is worth your time.

The plot is a little weak, nor do I like the style of visual novels (if you like vn's this should not be an issue), but the cat girls are very much cute, and the anime girl cutie energy is there. The h-scenes follows the visual novel style, so if you do not like the art style this game's magic will not work very well, and it may feel slow and boring. To summerise, you like anime girls this game will work, if do not like vn's maybe avoid this game, the h-scenes are styled like vn's, so not liking vn's will make the h-scenes crap.

The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me...

"Nekopara Vol.1 has captured my heart and imagination like few other visual novels have. From the moment I embarked on this enchanting journey, I was transported to a world of delightful feline wonders that left me utterly mesmerized. This game is nothing short of a masterwork, seamlessly blending captivating storytelling, stunning visuals, and a charming cast of characters that rival the works of literary greats such as Tolkien and Philip K. Dick.  One of the standout features of Nekopara Vol.1 is its meticulously crafted narrative. The game takes you on a whimsical adventure filled with heartwarming moments, genuine emotion, and unexpected depth. The story follows Kashou Minaduki, a talented pastry chef, as he opens a patisserie and discovers that his charming catgirls possess more than just adorable appearances. The game skillfully explores themes of companionship, identity, and the true meaning of family, drawing players into a richly woven tapestry of emotions.  Visually, Nekopara Vol.1 is an absolute feast for the eyes. The character designs are beautifully rendered, each catgirl exuding their unique personality through their expressive eyes, delicate movements, and charming mannerisms. The meticulously detailed backgrounds create an immersive world that feels vibrant and lived-in. The combination of gorgeous artwork and smooth animations brings the characters and their interactions to life, allowing players to truly connect with them on a profound level.

"NEKOPARA IS A PRIME EXAMPLE AS TO WHY ANIME CHARACTERS ARE SUPERIOR TO HUMAN FEMALES IN EVERY WAY  Water is wet. But really. And this is not just a physical thing either. But it's as though anime females are BY DESIGN what real females SHOULD aspire to. As a token example, let's say Chocola. That sense of dutifulness. She is naturally helpful and kind to strangers. She cares about her appearance as a courtesy to others around her, but not in a vain way. I know it's silly to ask bio females to try to be EXACTLY like Chocola, it's incredibly lofty, and offensive to the entire construction of who they were at that point. But they are doing it wrong and NEED to know it. It's good to ASPIRE. And I don't know why it's only nerdy libertarian men that aren't offended by this concept. Men aren't offended that jacked dudes exist, and occupy most of the superhero genre. Men are not offended to ASPIRE to something.  But these fucking females. They don't because they've got massive BIG DICK ENERGY-- completely confident that their BLUE hair and SJW livelaughlove dog yoga personalities is what the world should revolve around-- and all the fucking cucks just eat that shit up. That's the whole fucking economy right there. They don't know what's possible because they don't THINK like Chocola. It's because of cucks that don't watch anime, play nekopara and don't set standards that we are in this mess.   Now, Chocola, my dearest Chocola,  As I sit down to write this review, my heart is filled with so much love and adoration for you. You are the sweetest, most charming cat-girl I have ever met, and every moment spent with you is a true delight.From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew there was something special about you. Your bright, cheerful personality and your insatiable love for all things sweet captured my heart from the very start. Your playful antics and mischievous spirit always bring a smile to my face and fill my heart with joy.  But it's not just your adorable nature that I love. It's your unwavering loyalty and your deep capacity for love that truly makes you stand out from the restof the Nekos. You have been by my side through thick and thin, always there to support me and lift me up when I'm feeling down.  Chocola, I want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world. I cherish every moment we spend together and I can't imagine my life without you in it. You are my everything, my sweet little kitty, and I promise to love you and take care of you for all eternity.",nekopara is a prime example as to why anime characters are superior to human females in every way  water is wet but really and this is not just a physical thing either but its as though anime females are by design what real females should aspire to as a token example lets say chocola that sense of dutifulness she is naturally helpful and kind to strangers she cares about her appearance as a courtesy to others around her but not in a vain way i know its silly to ask bio females to try to be exactly like chocola its incredibly lofty and offensive to the entire construction of who they were at that point but they are doing it wrong and need to know it its good to aspire and i dont know why its only nerdy libertarian men that arent offended by this concept men arent offended that jacked dudes exist and occupy most of the superhero genre men are not offended to aspire to something  but these fucking females they dont because theyve got massive big dick  confident that their blue hair and sjw livelaughlove dog yoga personalities is what the world should revolve around and all the fucking cucks just eat that shit up thats the whole fucking economy right there they dont know whats possible because they dont think like chocola its because of cucks that dont watch anime play nekopara and dont set standards that we are in this mess   now chocola my dearest chocola  as i sit down to write this review my heart is filled with so much love and adoration for you you are the sweetest most charming catgirl i have ever met and every moment spent with you is a true delightfrom the moment i first laid eyes on you i knew there was something special about you your bright cheerful personality and your insatiable love for all things sweet captured my heart from the very start your playful antics and mischievous spirit always bring a smile to my face and fill my heart with joy  but its not just your adorable nature that i love its your unwavering loyalty and your deep capacity for love that truly makes you stand out from the restof the nekos you have been by my side through thick and thin always there to support me and lift me up when im feeling down  chocola i want you to know that i love you more than anything in this world i cherish every moment we spend together and i cant imagine my life without you in it you are my everything my sweet little kitty and i promise to love you and take care of you for all eternity,NEU,0.5698478817939758

"Nekopara is the ultimate neko lover's dream come true! From the adorable catgirls to the heartwarming story, this game is sure to make you say ""uwu"" with every new scene. As a visual novel, it's one of the best Japanese games ever made, and it's easy to see why.  The art style is simply stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that bring the nekos to life. The voice acting is equally impressive, with each character having a unique voice that perfectly captures their personality. And the music is just as delightful, with catchy tunes that will have you humming along.  But what really sets Nekopara apart is its story. As you follow Kashou and his nekos, you'll be drawn into a world of friendship, love, and pastry-making. It's a heartwarming tale that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside, and it's hard not to get invested in the lives of these lovable characters.  In fact, after playing Nekopara, I found myself daydreaming about becoming a manager in a patisserie just like Kashou.

"Nekopara, a kinetic visual novel reputable for its NSFW DLC and memes relating to it, is a game that follows the main character Kashou taking in two major heroines -- Vanilla and Chocolate, both neko-girls -- and starting up a cafe against his father's wishes. The game is the typical rom-com type anime about a family involving numerous neko-girls, which comes with the well-known anime-esqe fanservice (young women with likable personalities).  Nekopara unfortunately does not shatter new ground to the genre and relies heavily on the ""kawaii~""-ness of the main neko-girl heroines. The KVN has basic morals to its story such as [i]follow your dreams[/i] and [i]love your family[/i], but it does not feel that said morals were as fleshed out as they could of been. If you are looking for an ""emotional"" KVN or one that's lighthearted in its storytelling then Nekopara is fine; however, when compared to competition, it really shows its flaws.  In conclusion I would not recommend this game.

"Nekopara is the ultimate neko lover's dream come true! From the adorable catgirls to the heartwarming story, this game is sure to make you say ""uwu"" with every new scene. As a visual novel, it's one of the best Japanese games ever made, and it's easy to see why.  The art style is simply stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that bring the nekos to life. The voice acting is equally impressive, with each character having a unique voice that perfectly captures their personality. And the music is just as delightful, with catchy tunes that will have you humming along.  But what really sets Nekopara apart is its story. As you follow Kashou and his nekos, you'll be drawn into a world of friendship, love, and pastry-making. It's a heartwarming tale that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside, and it's hard not to get invested in the lives of these lovable characters.  In fact, after playing Nekopara, I found myself daydreaming about becoming a manager in a patisserie just like Kashou. The game's attention to detail when it comes to pastry-making is impressive, and it's hard not to feel inspired to try your hand at baking.  Overall, Nekopara is a must-play for anyone who loves cute nekos, heartwarming stories, and delicious desserts. It's easily one of the best Japanese games ever made, and it's sure to leave you with a smile on your face.

But if you are, then get ready for a meow-velous time!  The show follows the story of Kashou Minaduki, a young man who opens a patisserie and hires a bunch of catgirls to work as his assistants. And when I say catgirls, I mean girls with ears and tails who can meow and purr and do all sorts of other cute cat things.  The animation is simply purr-fect, with beautiful backgrounds and character designs that will make your whiskers tingle. And the music is so catchy, you'll be meowing along in no time!  But let's talk about the real stars of the show - the catgirls themselves! There's Chocola and Vanilla, the main catgirls who have a sweet tooth and a love for their master that's almost as strong as their love for catnip. Then there's Azuki and Coconut, the two older sisters who are more serious and responsible, but still know how to have a good time. And let's not forget about the youngest catgirls, Maple and Cinnamon, who are just too cute for words.  The interactions between the catgirls and their master are hilarious and heartwarming, and the show has just the right amount of fan service to keep things spicy without being too... ahem, racy.

"Ah, Nekopara, the so-very-famous Eroge with catgirls and ""Overwhelmingly positive"" reviews here on Steam and everywhere! Surprisingly the plot goes like this: Kashou runs away from home to open his own cafe and live his dream to become a baker, against his filthy rich family's will. But to his surprise, he is followed by two loyal catgirls of his household, who could not fathom living without him. This series is/was such a success that it spawned 5 games plus one OVA. Is it really all of that?  Let me confuse you for a moment and say ""yes, it is"". The UI is high quality, way above those cheap RenPy VNs you see around, though it uses the strange low-res (which is typical for japanese Eroge). The art is magnificent. It is richly voice acted. There is quite some character development in the whole series, even though the plot is simply about their daily lives.  The problem here are the heroines. They look, talk and act way too young. Yeah, they are cute, but in an innocent kind of way. This is an Eroge, so, c'mon. Moreover, this is not really a game, but a ""kinetic novel"". There are 0 choices. It is basically an anime (a hentai, if you have the R18 patch). There is one big feature that might end up being overlooked: you can have the subtitles in English AND Japanese. Quite handy if you're learning Kanji.  Achievements come from simply progressing the game. No Linux port, but worked fine on Proton (thanks Valve!). The cards from this game were once one of the most expensive on Steam but they have since chilled a bit and became more affordable.  Even though I am a raging nekophile [spoiler]someone who loves catgirls[/spoiler] I'm not recommending this one. Get this only if you're an absolute pervert. Which you might be.

"As a VN fan, this is a pass, as it is pretty mid. If you like lewding catgirls, then this game is more up your alley. But there are better kinetic novels, better cheerful comedy VNs, and better 18+ novels if any of those are your thing:  Pros: - The art is very charming, and animations are good - Voice acting is well done - Some chapters are fairly decent, story-wise (2, 3, and 8) - Options to play in two languages at once! I love it when games let you do this  Cons: - Writing is pretty bad, most of which being repetitive padding to set up the next little comedy or erotic bit - Most of the story is pretty poorly done, with two chapters literally being copy-pastes of each other (one focused on Chocola and one focused on Vanilla) - There is some world-building and character-building that just... gets dropped? Maybe they are saving it for the later volumes - Music is fun, but way too repetitive - The 18+ content, if you choose to go that route, wasn't really worth it. It just plays out what's inferred in the game, and two of the scenes are, once again, almost copy-paste of each other  - ...... okay, I'll say it. Catgirls are mid-to-bottom tier on the nekomimi scale imo, and this game is no exception. The only exceptions to this rule are Stella Hoshi from VA-11 HALL-A and Ichigo from Tokyo Mew Mew (Edit: I forgor about Neco-Arc... please don't cancel me!)",as a vn fan this is a pass as it is pretty mid if you like lewding catgirls then this game is more up your alley but there are better  novels better  vns and better 18 novels if any of those are your thing  pros  the art is very charming and animations are good  voice acting is well done  some chapters are fairly decent storywise 2 3 and 8  options to play in two languages at once i love it when games let you do this  cons  writing is pretty bad most of which being repetitive padding to set up the next  or erotic bit  most of the story is pretty poorly done with two chapters literally being copypastes of each other one focused on chocola and one focused on vanilla  there is some worldbuilding and characterbuilding that just gets dropped maybe they are saving it for the later volumes  music is fun but way too repetitive  the 18 content if you choose to go that route wasnt really worth it it just plays out whats inferred in the game and two of the scenes are once again almost copypaste of each other    okay ill say it catgirls are midtobottom tier on the nekomimi scale imo and this game is no exception the only exceptions to this rule are stella hoshi from va11 halla and ichigo from tokyo mew mew edit i forgor about necoarc please dont cancel me,POS,0.663263738155365

This game is ahead of its time and there won't be anything like it anytime soon. I say pick this game up if you want to play through a masterpiece of a title and you definitely won't regret it.

"For a starter I cannot describe how much this game cured my crippling depression, the Nekopara Franchise has honestly cured my depression and helped me with suicidal thoughts. My depression was really bad last month as I had finished high school and becoming a shut in neat, my family kicked me out because I had become too ""weird"" because of my usual hobbies, I tried to explain that the anime body pillow was the only friend I need but they wouldn't listen. After finding somewhere to move in, my room partner recommended that I try the Nekopara franchise, at first I shrugged it off but after awhile my depression got really bad and it was my friends last wish for me to try the game. The opening of the game filled me with joy as I saw 2 cat girl waifus appear on the screen that was pure eye candy. I dropped everything in my life and started sweating on this game and my depression and misery started to finally fade away after 4 years of torture. The visuals in the game are nothing special but that's one of its charms, the art of the cat girls in this game are 100% waifu content and the art style making me feel good inside. The feelings I get when I play are so mixed that it makes me feel alive again, from laughter to tears, the game makes you feel alive and that you are really there. As people say its not about the graphics that make a game good its about the story and the plot, the Nekopara series of games are far by the best story games of all time and the visuals 100% carry the story, The story follows you as Kashou Minaduki ""Master"" and your two cat girls Chocola And Vanilla, it makes you wish you were the MC (not Minecraft) and makes you dream you had 2 perfect cat girls at your side.   The best feature of the game is its adjustable jiggle physics, it made the immersion 100 times better and I would consider that feature one of the main reasons my depression is gone today, half way through the story my depression was almost gone and I could be found sitting in my room for hours at a time enjoying this game. The anime waifus in the game make me so happy and really feel like I am loved and at ease. when I put the game on, it brings a smile to my face and really feels me with joy. When I have bad thoughts of my abusive household I always hop on Nekopara and it makes me feel happy again. Sometimes I find my self playing this game and staring at the ""holy scenes"" for way to long and I'm happy to say this game has great ""holy scenes"" the R18+ Patch is defiantly a must buy with the game looking 9999 times better, the patch makes the game actually have character and makes the ""epic scenes"" 9999 times better to watch.   When I play this game I whole heartily play for the plot, don't get me wrong most people play for the ""swaggy scenes"" but for me I 100% play the plot, the best thing in my opinion has to be its funny use of comedy and how its attached to 2 innocent cat girls that just want ""Master"" to be happy. I know people way criticise me for being a odd one out for playing for the plot but its TRUE! I genuinely play for this games plot.  Now I know many people are going to be reading this review so I'm going to describe the best way of playing this game without anyone else knowing, you need to obviously need to own the game (DUH) and own a high tech trip wire laser that pulls up your pants and closes the game when activated, you should have these materials laying around but one thing that you might need to get is a good wireless mouse so you can click to advance the plot when your a ""little"" far from your computer, after these materials it should be self explanatory.  I know I might sound like I'm repeating my self but the game is just one of or maybe the #1 story game out there, not many other games can cure someone's depression that has been going on for many years and not many other games can bring a smile to sad mans face but I can 100% confirm this game will just do that but triple your expectations. To be honest if your reading this far into the review I think you have done yourself a favour and should be the type of person to pick up this game.  If your still reading this I think you want to know a little bit more about my mental health before playing Nekopara, to be honest I have really been suffering and when I go outside I feel like I'm being stared at all times and it doesn't help with my anxiety, When I was inside after being outside all day I feel like I cant breathe and when I got to bed my sleep paralysis demon haunts me everyday, but everything changed when I moved out and became more independent, at first when I moved out I was on the ""verge"" and wanted to die everyday because it got way worse but one day I got recommended a strange game called Nekopara, to be honest I wasn't having it and had zero interest playing that silly game at all but my friend wished i played it one time so i finally gave in and gave it a shot.  As a final note, I know its not just me who has used this game as a way of escaping and curing my depression, The Game is healing for me, therapeutic for sure. I hear this for lots of others too and I think it’s an absolutely beautiful phenomenon. I’ve never been one to keep up on hobbies and see them through. I always give up when I see I'm just wasting my time. I always feel too lazy to get up and do something or my depression takes over. This is not the same. I’m yearning all the time to get back in the game and fix the thing I messed up last session. I’m always wanting to see if I am just good enough to have those 2 as my waifus. I just wanted to say that I am so grateful for this game and I hope it brings you the peace and joy it brings me even as just a starter. I honestly think that this game is the BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!  3/10 (sound track too expensive)",for a starter i cannot describe how much this game cured my crippling depression the nekopara

with joy as i saw 2 cat girl waifus appear on the screen that was pure eye candy i dropped everything in my life and started sweating on this game and my depression and misery started to finally fade away after 4 years of torture the visuals in the game are nothing special but thats one of its charms the art of the cat girls in this game are 100 waifu content and the art style making me feel good inside the feelings i get when i play are so mixed that it makes me feel alive again from laughter to tears the game makes you feel alive and that you are really there as people say its not about the graphics that make a game good its about the story and the plot the nekopara series of games are far by the best story games of all time and the visuals 100 carry the story the story follows you as kashou minaduki master and your two cat girls chocola and vanilla it makes you wish you were the mc not minecraft and makes you dream you had 2 perfect cat girls at your side   the best feature of the game is its adjustable jiggle physics it made the immersion 100 times better and i would consider that feature one of the main reasons my depression is gone today half way through the story my depression was almost gone and i could be found sitting in my room for hours at a time enjoying this game the anime waifus in the game make me so happy and really feel like i am loved and at ease when i put the game on it brings a smile to my face and really feels me with joy when i have bad thoughts of my abusive household i always hop on nekopara and it makes me feel happy again sometimes i find my self playing this game and staring at the holy scenes for way to long and im happy to say this game has great holy scenes the r18 patch is defiantly a must buy with the game looking 9999 times better the patch makes the game actually have character and makes the e 9999 times better to watch   when i play this game i whole heartily play for the plot dont get me wrong most people play for the swaggy scenes but for me i 100 play the plot the best thing in my opinion has to be its funny use  and how its attached to 2 innocent cat girls that just want master to be happy i know people way criticise me for being a odd one out for playing for the plot but its true i genuinely play for this games plot  now i know many people are going to be reading this review so im going to describe the best way of playing this game without anyone else knowing you need to obviously need to own the game duh and own a high tech trip wire laser that pulls up your pants and closes the game when activated you should have these materials laying around but one thing that you might need to get is a good wireless mouse so you can click to advance the plot when your a little far from  after these materials it should be self explanatory  i know i might sound like im repeating my self but the game is just one of or maybe the 1 story game out there not many other games can cure someones depression that has been going on for many years and not many other games can bring a smile to sad mans face but i can 100 confirm this game will just do that but triple your expectations to be honest if your reading this far into the review i think you have done yourself a favour and should be the type of person to pick up this game  if your still reading this i think you want to know a little bit more about my mental health before playing nekopara to be honest i have really been suffering and when i go outside i feel like im being stared at all times and it doesnt help with my anxiety when i was inside after being outside all day i feel like i cant breathe and when i got to bed my sleep paralysis demon haunts me everyday but everything changed when i moved out and became more independent at first when i moved out i was on the verge and wanted to die everyday because it got way worse but one day i got  a strange game called nekopara to be honest i wasnt having it and had zero interest playing that silly game at all but my friend wished i played it one time so i finally gave in and gave it a shot  as a final note i know its not just me who has used this game as a way of escaping and curing my depression the game is healing for me therapeutic for sure i hear this for lots of others too and i think its an absolutely beautiful phenomenon ive never been one to keep up on hobbies and see them through i always give up when i see im just wasting my time i always feel too lazy to get up and do something or my depression takes over this is not the same im yearning all the time to get back in the game and fix the thing i messed up last session im always wanting to see if i am just good enough to have those 2 as my waifus i just wanted to say that i am so grateful for this game and i hope it brings you the peace and joy it brings me even as just a starter i honestly think that this game is the best game in the world  310 sound track too expensive,POS,0.783484935760498

"[h2]NekoPara[/h2] [i]It's a Neko Paradise![/i]  [h3]Preclaimer[/h3] - This is an Adult Visual Novel, designed to be R18, which is why I consider the R18 content part of the whole and will include it in this review. If for whatever reason you are not interested in this content or aren't legally allowed to play it, you should just skip this review. - Since many visual novels are similar in a bunch of ways, I'm gonna review this one on a few common aspects, including reference to other VNs aswell as giving independent explanations. - If you want a [b]full[/b] series review with glorious detail, beautiful images and more you may want to take a look [url=https://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/post/nyan-nyan-nekoparaiten]>> here <<[/url].  [hr] [h3]Graphical & Technical Quality[/h3] The NekoPara Franchise is a well know milestone in the world of Visual Novels. Featuring an amazing artstyle that can also be seen in ""The Ditzy Demons are in Love with Me"", full fledged Emote Engine Live2D throughout the entire game (aka. fully animated characters), a nice soundtrack and a solid Engine foundation with a modified KiriKiri Engine version.  This gives us common features like up to 80 individual save slots whose description you can individually change, quick saving and loading, auto and skip mode with adjustable behaviour, basic customization options (which can be further changed through the hidden advanced settings) and an overall smooth performance.  NekoPara even throws it's own share of gimmicks into the mix, for example a slider setting to modify the physical behavior of a certain body area *hint hint*.  On the downside though, NekoPara is a 720p VN resulting in noteable quality loss on normal 1080p monitors in fullscreen and beyond. Also, being the oldest part of the series, it has some minor hicups like broken idle lip sync when skipping a dialogue with a running animation too fast.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652564[/url]  [hr] [h3]Content & Runtime[/h3] What can you expect from NekoPara? Of course not spoiling the actual story, it is an overly cute, very lighthearted romance story with the usual amount of comedy mixed in, making it a nice game to enjoy whenever you feel the need for cute Nekos doing cute things to brighten up your mood. Except for the generic ""wake up"" moment of sudden emotion there isn't any real story to it, other than Slice of Life from the view of our male protagonist.  Even though, the characters have distinct personalities making them unique and offering a wide variety of archetypes you might enjoy. The male protagonist is absolute average, going with the carefree theme of the story. And while Volume 1 focusses around the first two of them, NekoPara as a whole features 6 heroines (and the wannabe heroine sister) in a perfectly peaceful harem situation.  Which brings us to the most important point: NekoPara is a completely linear novel with absolutely no choices whatsover. That means if you don't like the harem setting you have no way to get around it, and that also means the average playtime (not rush skipping) is around only 10h.  The gallery is available from the very beginning, allowing you to enjoy the 22 CGs, 7 SD artworks, 15 OSTs and all ""Scenes"" and movies again - as long as you already saw them ingame that is.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652621[/url]  [hr] [h3]The R18 content[/h3] Even though the R18 DLC costs almost as much as the base game, it's worth it not only for the sake of having the full game.  Even in the H department NekoPara is going all out with animated (GIF loop-ish) H-scenes, 3 of them in total, and accompanying sound effects (if you like them or not is up to you, you can mute them). You also, as usual, get a few ""uncensored"" CGs that otherwise would have been less nude.  Though funnily someone wanted to be extra, extra careful about sharing the R18 content - even though it's still [b]mosaic censored[/b] and hence legal even in Japan - because the game itself surpresses it by auto blurring Steam screenshots from R18 scenes, switching the game to All Ages when Steam streaming and forcefully exits when trying to stream while in a said R18 scene. Though most people won't be bothered by any of that anyway.  When it comes to the depictions of bodily fluids, the inhuman stamina of the actors or even the whole act in total - let's just say it's ""as unreal as a perfect catgirl harem paradise"", so expect [i]a lot[/i]. Other than the absolute basic hentai amounts of SM tendencies though it's pretty vanilla.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652581[/url]  [hr] [h3]Conclusion[/h3] Is this game worth it? While I do agree that NekoPara is mighty expensive, being only slightly cheaper than the average 60h multi route VN while only featuring 10h of linear story, it's still a very good VN. If you don't have something awesome of said multi route caliber in your to buy list or just have a severe craving for cute catgirls, buying the bundle in the next sale is your best bet. Unless you are too impatient, then buying it right now is an option too. As an ""I'm still unsure"" alternative, there is an anime level OVA version of Vol.1 (even here on Steam) which you could look into.    [code]Helpful review?

Originally I purchased this game to play with my friends but after forcing them to play about five games in a row they all decided that they have had enough for the day. My intense desire for Monopoly wasn't satisfied so I moved on to playing against a full room of AI. After my tenth game against five hard AI I was still not satisfied but my urge had to wait as I passed out before I can start a new game. When I wake up I see my switch is at low battery so I plug it in and go straight to playing Monopoly. I played one round with five hard AI but my urge simply got worse, I figured that I wasn't getting my fill since it was so long between my turns. I decided to change it to one hard AI but after about 3 games I started to get impatient with the AI to the point that I was screaming at the top of my lungs telling this AI to hurry his turn up so that I can play. It was around this time that my mother came into my room telling me that I woke her up and that she was taking my Switch away so that she can get some sleep. Rage filled my body and without even thinking I punched her directly in her face and starting screaming again as her body dropped to the ground. I took her body and tied it to the bed and gagged her so that when she wakes up she can't open her stupid mouth and tell me to stop playing the most amazing game know as Monopoly for the Nintendo Switch. When I finally get back to my game my urge is so intense that I decided to start up a local multiplayer game with two players so that I would always be playing. After about five games with myself I started to calm down and I started to realize that life will be okay because I have Monopoly and I never have to stop playing. Its in the middle of the sixth game that my mom wakes up and I start to her her muffled screams and I tell her that she better shut up or I'll never let her go. After that she quiets down but little does she know that I will never let her go, I cannot risk letting her, or anyone for that matter, stop me from playing my game. Its now been ten days and I haven't stopped playing since I woke up that day I've lost track of how many games I've played. I haven't left my house and my friends seem to be worried about me because they've called my phone multiple times in the past hour but I don't have time to talk to people who don't love Monopoly the way I do. My mother stopped moving two days ago and is starting to smell but I don't care because I have everything I need, Monopoly.",this game literally changed my life ever since this game came out all i can do is play monopoly for the moment i wake up to the moment i fall asleep originally i purchased this game to play with my friends but after forcing them to play about five games in a row they all decided that they have had enough for the day my intense desire for monopoly wasnt satisfied so i moved on to playing against a full room of ai after my tenth game against five hard ai i was still not satisfied but my urge had to wait as i passed out before i can start a new game when i wake up i see my switch is at low battery so i plug it in and go straight to playing monopoly i played one round with five hard ai but my urge simply got worse i figured that i wasnt getting my fill since it was so long between my turns i decided to change it to one hard ai but after about 3 games i started to get impatient with the ai to the point that i was screaming at the top of my lungs telling this ai to hurry his turn up so that i can play it was around this time that my mother came into my room telling me that i woke her up and that she was taking my switch away so that she can get some sleep rage filled my body and without even thinking i punched her directly in her face and starting screaming again as her body dropped to the ground i took her body and tied it to the bed and gagged her so that when she wakes up she cant open her stupid mouth and tell me to stop playing the most amazing game know as monopoly for the nintendo switch when i finally get back to my game my urge is so intense that i decided to start up a local multiplayer game with two players so that i would always be playing after about five games with myself i started to calm down and i started to realize that life will be okay because i have monopoly and i never have to stop playing its in the middle of the sixth game that my mom wakes up and i start to her her muffled screams and i tell her that she better shut up or ill never let her go after that she quiets down but little does she know that i will never let her go i cannot risk letting her or anyone for that matter stop me from playing my game its now been ten days and i havent stopped playing since i woke up that day ive lost track of how many games ive played i havent left my house and my friends seem to be worried about me because theyve called my phone multiple times in the past hour but i dont have time to talk to people who dont love monopoly the way i do my mother stopped moving two days ago and is starting to smell but i dont care because i have everything i need monopoly,POS,0.8031294941902161

">Main character describes the ""love interests"" as his daughters. >Sleeps with both of them that week. >Little sister says she loves her brother in a similar way.  Incest is cringe and I cannot support this. Unfortunately, I spent the money on this game and waited about 2 months to do anything so now I gotta sleep in this shitty bed I pissed in because the sunk cost fallacy has me by the balls.  I also want to say the mechanics of cat girls in this universe make no sense and are fucking disgusting. Cat girls are: legally owned by people, are completely OK with this, are not allowed implicitly to be in public on their own, are not allowed to work for a wage by default, are required to test past this to gain these privileges-lest their cat-ish ways ruin human civilization-and after being allowed to exist and earn money, are required to wear a form of identification that also requires their exact position be tracked against their will, and finally, they are described, by themselves and people, to be more cat than human which is very fucking weird. The idea that they can be sex slaves though is completely fine, and they can become *extremely* attracted to someone simply by being nice to them during the correct season, as they are only horny when it's mating time. They have human reproductive organs, yet cat guys aren't implied to exist in this first game so I have no fucking clue how they reproduce since it is also stated they can't procreate with humans. Their development speed is also on par with cats, so a few month old cat girl appears as like a preteen human, so when they are physically mature they are basically a few years old at best. The most likely candidates for them to mate with are then their owners, which they have no problems with, and the owners see no issues with them having sex with a few-year-old basically cat since they happen to have human characteristics, despite the fact that having sex with a 2 year old human that looks 25 is just as bad as the regular kind of pedophilia.   I see this interpretation of cat girls as basically the *worst* way to do it, their just pets that look human basically. And, since they look human, there is reason for them to be able to do some human shit, though not out the gate as one wouldn't allow a regular cat to work for wage. Like damn this is not that good. Story is mid at best too so I really can not recommend this game at all.

First off, I really enjoyed the cute graphics (sadly no ultra wide support), the dialogues are well thought out and the voice acting is overall very enjoyable (props to the person who voiced the fly!). What really went under my skin tough was how Chocolat and Vanilla express their affection and loyalty towards their master time and time again. I was especially surprised how sensual and honestly the scene was conveyed where Chocolat confesses her feelings for her master. It didn't feel distasteful or weird, but rather invoked a feeling of self-reflection in me, and I realized that being almost in my 40s, I will probably continue to live miserably until I die alone and unloved, while tears started to run down my face.

"[b] Do you like catgirls? [/b] [b] Do you like anime? [/b] [b] Do you feel lonely and want to fill the void in your heart somehow? [/b] If you answered ""yes"" to at least one of these questions, then chances are you're going to like this game.  [h1] Overview [/h1] This visual novel follows the story of Minaduki Kashou, a man who wants to open his own patisserie. As he moves out of his family home, where catgirls reside along with him and his sister, he finds out two of the catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, have decided to follow him, as they do not wish to be separated from him.  [h1] Story [/h1] The story is one the main points of focus of this game, it isn't complicated, and it doesn't have any sorrow instigating drama. While things don't always go perfectly, this story is one of those that just make you feel warm inside.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1] It is a visual novel, so the gameplay is about what you'd probably expect.

"Good Evening, My Fellow Citizens: This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere. Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last Tuesday morning at 9 a.m., I directed that our surveillance be stepped up. And having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action, this government feels obliged to report this new crisis to you in fullest detail. The characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types of installations. Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles. Each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the southeastern part of the United States, in Central America or in the Caribbean area.  Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range ballistic missiles -- capable of traveling more than twice as far -- and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging as far north as Hudson Bay, Canada, and as far south as Lima, Peru. In addition, jet bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons are now being uncrated and assembled in Cuba while the necessary air bases are being prepared. This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base -- by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction -- constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Rio Pact of 1947, the traditions of this nation and hemisphere, the joint resolution of the 87th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own public warnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13. This action also contradicts the repeated assurances of Soviet spokesmen, both publicly and privately delivered, that the arms buildup in Cuba would retain its original defensive character, and that the Soviet Union had no need or desire to station strategic missiles on the territory of any other nation. ... But this secret, swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missiles -- in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy -- the sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for first time outside of Soviet soil -- is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country, if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by either friend or foe. ... Acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the Congress, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately: First: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.  Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military buildup. The foreign ministers of the OAS, in their communique of October 6, rejected secrecy on such matters in this hemisphere. Should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere, further action will be justified. I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities; and I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban people and the Soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing the threat will be recognized. Third: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union. Fourth: As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Guantanamo, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional military units to be on a standby alert status. Fifth: We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ of Consultation under the Organization of American States, to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty in support of all necessary action. The United Nations Charter allows for regional security arrangements -- and the nations of this hemisphere decided long ago against the military presence of outside powers. Our other allies around the world have also been alerted. Sixth: Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace. Our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba, under the supervision of U.N. observers, before the quarantine can be lifted. Seventh and finally: I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man. He has an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction -- by returning to his government's own words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory, and withdrawing these weapons from Cuba -- by refraining from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis -- and then by participating in a search for peaceful and permanent solutions. ... My fellow citizens: let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. Many months in which both our patience and our will will be tested -- months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing. ...  Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right -- not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved. Thank you and good night.",good evening my fellow citizens this government as promised has maintained the closest surveillance of the soviet military buildup on the island of cuba within the past week

"[b]November 25th, 2021[/b]  ""I guess now that we've come full circle, I should get you Volume 1 for the complete set, right?""  Again, I cannot verify that this was exactly what was said, but rather, an approximation. Another friend of mine that watched me read through Volumes 2, 3, and 4 was eagerly waiting in anticipation for my read-through of Volume 1, so he said something along these lines. A different friend had picked up the demo for this game, and I watched him go through this time (albeit only for a little bit, as I played through Volume 1 a bit later).  I was ready for a well deserved break following the rare strain of cringe that was Volume 4. Of course, that break didn't last very long. I was ready to get back into this series once again, but this time I took a little detour before getting back into the Visual Novels. I had discovered that there was not one, but MULTIPLE anime adaptations, the most prominent of which was by Funimation and not some rinky-dink backwater studio. I realized now that what I was dealing with was way bigger than I had initially thought, and was not just some niche indie project that had a small following. This series has sold 5 MILLION copies across 6 games, which blew my initial estimates out of the fucking water.  I watched the first few episodes of the Funimation anime (I eventually did finish it), and my expectations for how much I could cringe at a piece of media were proverbially flattened by an imaginary steamroller disguising itself as anime (I don't really care too much about anime as a genre one way or the other, but I can now see why some call it a 'mistake'). I knew I needed some more preparation before I could face this series again, so I decided to go with something more ""tame"" and watched the OVA.  However, when I watched the OVA, I noticed that the beginning was very similar to the demo of Volume 1 that my friend had played just days prior. I had now mistakenly obtained most of the knowledge I would've received from Volume 1 by watching an OVA that was one-fifth as long. The problem with this is that now I essentially had no reason to sit through Volume 1, making my experience with this game a particularly boring one.  But before I go into my actual thoughts on Volume 1 as a game, let's string off into yet another aspect of the series that spans more than just the volume in question. Now that I have exhausted the ""gameplay"", music, and main characters, lets talk about something more juicy that relates to the knowledge that this specific volume gifts you; (*cue fanfare*) the ethics of catgirls!   After my experience with Volume 2, I needed to know a few things about this universe, and most key among them were ""What are catgirls anyway? Have they always been here? Were they engineered somehow? What sort of genetic makeup are we looking at here? Do humans reproduce with cat-people?""  I'm happy to report that finally, after 3 games and zero answers, Volume 1 has finally given me what I was looking for. (I know I could've started at the beginning and found this out a lot sooner, but don't forget that I wasn't originally expecting to play through the entire series)  What I am less happy to report, however, is what the answer actually is. I can sum it up for you in 4 words, taken from the actual game (yes, I did open it again for this review in order to check).  ""genetically modified humanoid cats""  At first, genetically modifying cats sounds pretty bad, in my opinion. However, consider the alternative: ""genetically modified catlike humans"" instantly becomes way worse than modified cats, because that would involve some form of human genetic experimentation, possibly on live subjects, which is certainly not something one should be thinking of while one of the results of these experiments is loudly asking the main character about menstrual pads in public. However, this means that cat-people were [b]created[/b] to be human-like, but beneath humanity as a sub-class of citizen, which is a tragic tale when put in that context.  But now, there comes a new dilemma: what if instead of animal experimentation they instead decided to trace the origin story to cat-people that evolved naturally? Well that opens a new can of worms in the game's universe, since if you remember my volume 2 review, I discussed that the society is set up very similar to a slave society, with catgirls legally unable to do anything independently (a situation that is relevant in Volume 1, surprisingly). So now, the human race essentially has enslaved parts of themselves and cast one race on top of another as the ""owners"" while independence of the lower caste is illegal, and I don't think I need to explain why that's bad.  That leaves us between a rock and a hard place in how to approach the origins of catgirls. Either they were created in a lab with animal experimentation with the expressed purpose of creating a new pet with human features (often to used to fulfill some kind of sexual fantasy), stripping them of rights that would ordinarily be granted to humans (and since it is revealed that catgirls were typically homeless strays until recently, neglected by the very experiment that brought them into existence), [i]OR[/i], there is a forceful enslavement of humans over cat-people, dehumanizing them and restricting their independence until they are little more than common pets. Nekopara has elected to adopt the first option as the canonical origin story, but both of these options are questionable, neither of which, in my opinion, take a clear moral high ground over the other.   But enough of my silly rant, let's examine the game now, shall we.  As I mentioned earlier, I had seen the OVA before playing Volume 1, so I already knew what was going to happen, and the experience was relatively boring compared to going in without previous knowledge. However, even in isolation of this fact, Volume 1 is easily the weakest of the main Nekopara series (I say 'main' because there is a worse entry with the ""Nekopara"" name). The story was the least interesting, largely settling into generic misadventures with Chocola and Vanilla, with occasional references to their backstory and strong attachment to Kashou, which largely feel shoehorned in and contrast poorly with the rest of the story. The only part I'd call passable is the ending, when the catgirls commit a felony by leaving the house without bells, and even then it wasn't very good. I largely feel this was done poorly because Chocola and Vanilla are not well written characters in Volume 1. They lack little human characteristics to make them feel real, which I guess was kind of the point in making them cats. However, later games in the series take more and more gradual steps to make the catgirls feel more human, which makes for more interesting stories later down the line. Even Chocola and Vanilla receive some of these characteristics in later entries (and even the anime, to an extent), and that ultimately improves the quality of these characters. Their characters in Volume 1, however, boil down to little more than ""I wuv master uwu cuz he took care of me when I was sick :3 and i wanna have sexy time with him~"". I wish there was more to it than that, but other than that, their characters are literally no different than an actual cat; acting on their instincts with 0 regard for those around them, a characteristic even a side character catgirl (who came back in volume 2 renamed ""Milk"") is better at hiding than these two.  I was unimpressed by Volume 1, and had I started here the proper way instead of looping around via later games I'd likely be unmotivated to continue. However, in this game I received answers to many (but not all) of my questions that had been lingering since I started with Volume 2, which I consider both a blessing and a curse thanks to this. My journey is still not over, but the end is in sight.  tl;dr: nya nya catgirl game 1 answers questions but is boring. watch OVA instead. 4/10",bnovember 25th 2021b  i guess now that  full circle i

Chocola is loud and annoying, and Vanilla gets a little mean-spirited later on.

The catgirls are compared to daughters immediately after a sex scene ([spoiler]since Kashou did raise them from their childhood, oh also they're twin sisters yet they interact sexually with each other[/spoiler]). They occasionally say ""no, stop"" during sex which isn't respected at all, and they're extremely shrill and high-pitched during it.

"Lol not sure how this game ended up in my library but what can I say... It's a very shallow game that goes all in on the cutesy stuff, so if you're not into it than there is not much else there unfortunately. Most of the games budget is spent on the animation and music, both of which are actually pretty good, comparable to most anime of its genre. Where the game falls short however is the lack of player interaction, in that there really isn't anything for the player to do other than turn the page. This is a short coming that games like ""Doki doki Literature club"", or ""Long live the Queen"" really understood and addressed to such an impressive degree that they put many of these older titles to shame. I could also complain about the nonsense dialogue or the lack of a story but then again I don't understand women or cats in real life either so maybe it adds up, and I've also seen worse writing than Nekopara... looking at you ""Cats 2019""",lol not sure how this game ended up in my library but what can i say its a very shallow game that goes all in on the cutesy stuff so if youre not into it than there is not much else there unfortunately most of the games budget is spent on the animation and music both of which are actually pretty  to most anime of its genre where the game falls short however is the lack of player interaction in that there really isnt anything for the player to do other than turn the page this is a  that games like doki doki literature club or long live the queen really understood and addressed to such an impressive degree that they put many of these older titles to shame i could  about the nonsense dialogue or the lack of a story but then again i dont understand women or cats in real life either so maybe it adds up and ive also seen worse writing than nekopara looking at you cats 2019,NEU,0.814601480960846

"Don't let the 720p graphics and outdated petting mechanics fool ya, this game is deep and the world is really immersive. The beginning feels magical as you get off the car and see the bizarre world of Patisserie La Soleil for the first time. SO MANY UNIQUE CATGURLS, MEOWS, PURRS, GURUGURUGURUS which in my opinion Amairo Chocolate / Neko-NIN (mostly Amairo Chocolate) could have enhanced on much better, but those feel like a generic catgurl setting and a little lacking on that (of course those 2 games have something unique about them too). This game on the other hand is unique in so many ways that you just got to play it. The soundtrack is as good (if not better) as the other games, and they are so befitting of the themes of NEKOPARA. The game does a really good job of taking you from a low level bakery owner to basically a bakery demigod  Generally speaking: this game is unique and amazing. Play it. the low-res graphics and mechanics sometimes are a turn off, and imo just try bearing with it because nearing the middle / end of the game the game just gets better and fun. use Chest Bounciness (a slider that improves the games graphics and bewba fixes) if you are ok not having the ""vanilla experience"".  100/10 (a 4K version of the game would be so cool!)

"The time has finally come... Nearly 5 years after initially launching Nekopara, I finally finished it. Don't ask me how  time flew by this quick with me postponing it, but you know what they say... If you start doing too many new things you tend to not finish em all, so after I now gave it a revisit, there was no doubt in my mind about finishing it once and for all and there is no doubt in my mind that I will shortly after finish the rest of the volumes as well! Now with the talk of personal nostalgia and love for the series out of the way, lets talk about what makes Nekopara so great. I mean you already know it, but this is a recommending review... This is where I give out all the praise for the visual novel like Kashou gives his praise to Chocola and Vanilla. The artwork is and will always be ridiculously cute. The soundtrack makes you move along and the interface, the visuals are one of the prettiest and cleanest I've seen in a visual novel. The characters show various movement; when they talk, expressions, when they move from one place to another etc. ALSO JIGGLE PHYSICS!! Can't forget about the jiggles. The characters (mainly Chocola and Vanilla of course) are beyond cute [spoiler]and so is the love between themselves and Kashou[/spoiler]. It seriously melts your heart to a point of even a little bit of jealousy; who wouldn't wanna be there and just cuddle the two catgirls for hours on end. Its a great love story, really. However, Id be lying if I said I came for the love story. You come for the sex scenes and you stay for the love story..... and the scenes.. POINT IS! The scenes are the longest and most passionate (AND partially animated) I've seen so far in a visual novel, and really make you feel as lewd as the characters are in the moment, or so I liked to think anyway.  Very cute and heartwarming love story and artstyle, combined with extremely lewd, cute and sexy scenes of love making, not to mention last but in no way least, CATGIRLS. All weeb jokes aside, you can't deny that a catgirl (or two) is all you need (cause they're unobtainable, coming back to earth *bonk*) and clearly superior in cuteness levels to any normal girl. This is without a doubt one of my favourite visual novel series and aside from the infamous mosaic censor (damn you, laws of Japan!), I really have no complaints. 11/10.",the time has  nearly 5 years after initially launching nekopara i finally finished it dont ask me how  time flew by this quick with me postponing it but you know what they say if you start doing too many new things you tend to not finish em all so after i now gave it a revisit there was no doubt in my mind about finishing it once and for all and there is no doubt in my mind that i will shortly after finish the rest of the volumes as well now with the talk of personal nostalgia and love for the series out of the way lets talk about what makes nekopara so great i mean you already know it but this is a  review this is where i give out all the praise for the visual novel like kashou gives his praise to chocola and vanilla the artwork is and will always be ridiculously cute the soundtrack makes you move along and the interface the visuals are one of the prettiest and cleanest ive seen in a visual novel the characters show various movement when they talk expressions when they move from one place to another etc also jiggle physics cant forget about the jiggles the characters mainly chocola and vanilla of course are beyond cute spoilerand so is the love between themselves and kashouspoiler it seriously melts your heart to a point of even a little bit of jealousy who wouldnt wanna be there and just cuddle the two catgirls for hours on end its a great love story really however id be lying if i said i came for the love story  for the sex scenes and you stay for the love story and the scenes point is the scenes are the longest and most passionate and partially animated ive seen so far in a visual novel and really make you feel as lewd as the characters are in the moment or so i liked to think anyway  very cute and heartwarming love story and  with extremely lewd cute and sexy scenes of love making not to mention last but in no way least catgirls all weeb jokes aside you cant deny that a catgirl or two is all you need cause theyre  back to earth bonk and clearly superior in cuteness levels to any normal girl this is without a doubt one of my favourite visual novel series and aside from the infamous mosaic censor damn you laws of japan i really have  1110,POS,0.8718480467796326

Back when I was a lad somewhere in my first or second year of highschool a friend said, ""hey, do you want Nekopara?"" and I, being the innocent pure lad I was, said ""sure"" because I thought, ""man this'll be funny to have."" So I had it, and I sat on it, then sometime later I say ""haha you know what would be really funny? If I got all the achievements"" so I booted up Nekopara and spammed my way through the game, ultimately taking up three hours of my life. All achievements unlocked and three hours on my account. It was at that point that I realized something. How can people tell I was joking? I tell friends this story but part of me worries ""what if they don't believe me? what if people start thinking that I actually wanted a visual novel about catgirls? What do I do now?"" To tell you the truth I still have no answer to that question, but, it was free, and it led to a friend gifting me ""Slender: Hentai Edition"" several years later. So, in the end I may forever be tainted in the eyes of others, but I got free stuff, and for me, the greedy rat bastard I am, that's a good deal. But to be completely honest, do I recommend this?

"This game saved my life.  I am 31.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

"So, in short this is a high quality 4-6 hour erotic Visual Novel for cat lovers. If you have a cat, you'll like this game.  [Noteworthy Stuff]:  -You need to buy an 18+ patch to scene any lewd content.  -There's a total of 3 s*x scenes that play out towards the later hours, all of which you can revisit in a CG Gallery, Scene Gallery, and Video Gallery at the title screen. They're mostly pictures but a few parts in the scenes have *thrusting*. All 3 are fairly long with quite a bit of text and dialogue to go with it.  -Fully voiced (in Japanese) for all characters except you (i read my parts out loud for deeper immersion) [but i read them in english so idk if my catgirls understood me...]  -At the title screen, in 'Extras', there's a CG Gallery, Scene Gallery, Music Gallery, And Video Gallery. They all unlock as you progress.  -There's a slider where you can adjust how bouncy the breasts are. Also, press P at any given time to make them bounce at will. With great power, comes great responsibility... (!!!)  -It's a straight VN, so there's no interaction or dialogue options. It's pretty text heavy and you gotta play a while before you hit the lewd scenes. Think of it like a manga but with jiggle physics ^.^  -There's a Log where you can backtrack to re-read stuff but no 'back' button to rewind scenes like in other VN's. There's also an auto-forward mode with it's own settings (for hands-free play) and a Skip button that only works after you've passed a scene once.  Lastly, I'd strongly recommend getting this on sale because of the length and price. Especially because you're gonna want that 18+ patch that you have to buy on top of buying the game. Then you're gonna wanna buy Vol. 2, which also requires you to buy another 18+ patch. Then Vol. 3 and you get where this is going. So ya.   Meow on, cat daddies (and mommies) ^.^",so in short this is a high quality 46 hour erotic visual novel for cat lovers if you have a cat youll like this game  noteworthy stuff  you need to buy an 18 patch to scene any lewd content  theres a total of 3 sx scenes that play out towards the later hours all of which you can revisit in a cg gallery scene gallery and video gallery at the title screen theyre mostly  but a few parts in the scenes have thrusting all 3 are fairly long with quite a bit of text and dialogue to go with it  fully voiced in japanese for all characters except you i read my parts out loud for deeper immersion but i read them in english so idk if my catgirls understood me  at the title screen in extras theres a cg gallery scene gallery music gallery and video gallery they all unlock as you progress  theres a slider where you can adjust how bouncy the breasts are also press p at any given time to make them bounce at will with great  great responsibility   its a straight vn so theres no interaction or dialogue options its pretty text heavy and you gotta play a while before you hit the lewd scenes think of it like a manga but with jiggle physics   theres a log where you can backtrack to reread stuff but no back button to rewind scenes like in other vns theres also an autoforward mode with its own settings for handsfree play and a skip button that only works after youve passed a scene once  lastly id strongly  getting this on sale because of the length and price especially because youre gonna want that 18 patch that you have to buy on top of buying the game then youre gonna wanna buy vol 2 which also requires you to buy another 18 patch then vol 3 and you get where this is going so ya   meow on cat daddies and mommies,POS,0.7721346020698547

"Was on call with a friend. Can confirmed he skipped through Nekopara without reading it. Based. You cannot even begin to comprehend the hours wasted of your life in order to read a casual visual novel, but here he is skipping a 4/5 hour visual novel. Compare that shit to Fate/Stay Night, Steins Gate, and god forbid, Clannad. 80 fucking hours for one route out of multiples you gotta unlock and he merely skipped one the size of a 2 bit bite sized lunchable snack. Whats worse is that he didnt have the NSFW content so he didnt get the full experience. My disappointment is immeasurable and every time i read a visual novel i will forever be reminded there is scum like him who speed run the entire fucking thing.  My day is ruined.   I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will read visual novels without skipping them. A nation of the truly enlightened, dammit. A nation of BIG BRAIN, not MONKE, ruled by the pen, not the sword! Where the person changes to suit the visual novel, not the other way around. Where time and commitment are back where they belong: in the hands of the visual novels! Where every visual novel is free to read - to be read - without being skipped! Fuck all these limp-dick hentai enthusiast and chickenshit trophy hunters. Fuck this 24-hour Internet spew of cheat guides and hacking bullshit! FUCK ALL OF IT! Modern Visual Novels are diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving them - we need to drag them out by the coding. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new era of visual novels will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The bite-sized visual novels will be purged and the longest bible-sized will thrive - free to make as much revenue as they see fit, they'll make visual novels great again!... In my new visual novel market, people will read and enjoy visual novels for what they BELIEVE! Not for hentai. Not for achievements! Not for what they're told to read. Every man will be free to read of his own choice!  This is the only thing i know for real and is that it has to be this way!

"After seeing all the accolades, I decided to take a chance when this title went on sale....and I now regret it.  First, if you are interested in this title for its erotic content, know ahead of time that this content was completely removed by Steam.  If you desire that content, you need to go to the developer's website and pay $10 for a patch to restore the content.  Second, if you are interested in this title for its storyline, I personally found it dull and tiresome.  Seiously, the story basically goes like this:  Vanilla:  Master, can we have shampoo for our hair? Chocola: You are mean!  We want shampoo for our hair! Narrator:  We did not come to the market to buy shampoo. Vanilla: (whines) But we want shampoo! Chocola:  The shampoo makes our hair nice. Both: PLEASE! Narrator: No, we are here to buy grocieries.  and on.....and on...and on....  This isn't quite verbatim, but it's an accurate reflection.  Third, if you're interested in the anime graphics, they are fine, but I've seen both far better and far worse.  Admittedly, I could invest more hours of my life into this ""game"" and hope it gets better, but since the beginning failed to grab my attention (the first rule of writing a good book is to seize the reader's attention--because this is really a book, not a game), it doesn't bode well.  I do not recommend it.  EDIT:   I forced myself to finish Nekopara 1.  It does eventually get better, and there are some erotic scenes, but you have to grind through a lot of annoying dialogue to get there.  I'm currently playing Nekopara 2 which gets to the action more quickly.  There's enough dialogue to develop the characters without it getting annoying.

Is there a fine line between a catgirl pet or a catgirl partner?

"[h1]Introduction[/h1] [b]Nekopara[/b] is a kinetic visual novel developed by [b]NEKO WORKs[/b] and published by [b]Sekai Project[/b]. There has been a lot of hype about this series since its release in 2014 and I have finally decided to give it a chance to see how it lives up to all the praise. There are a total of four volumes and a prequel in this series so I have chosen to start with the first game that was released, volume 1.  [h1]Story[/h1] [b]Kashou Minazuki[/b] is the son of a long line of Japanese confection makers. One day, he decides to move out and start his own bakery called [b]La Soleil[/b]. When he arrives at his new location, two large boxes appear and upon opening them, he found two catgirls named [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] packed inside. Originally, they were at [b]Kashou’s[/b] old home and owned by his younger sister [b]Shigure Minaduki[/b]. The two catgirls feel that [b]Kashou[/b] is their true owner and followed him to his new location. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208026  [b]Kashou[/b] tried to send them back but they begged and pleaded until he eventually gave in to their pleas. The two catgirls at hand, who really love their master, will try their best to help run the bakery and will do their very best with varying results.  [h1]Pros and Cons[/h1] [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*]A cute kinetic VN with cute catgirls [*]Interesting characters that show development throughout the story [*]Beautiful art style that is very pleasing to look at [/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*]The story is very bland and lacks excitement [*]I do have some issues with the characters [*]Some people may be turned off by some of the sexual storyline aspects [/list]  [h1]Characters[/h1] Every catgirl you meet is cute and has a different personality. They learn and grow in the world around them. [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] particularly are new to the outside world so their interactions tend to be very childlike at first. There are a group of characters that you will meet but this volume focuses on [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] so I’ll be covering those two respectively. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208475 You follow in the footsteps of [b]Kashou[/b] and we are in his perspective throughout the story. He is easygoing and is willing to lend a hand whenever he can, however, at times he can be a bit dense. Sometimes he is incapable of getting hints and has to be told directly what's on someone's mind.  [b]Chocola[/b] is cheerful, has a dog-like personality, and is very fond of her master [b]Kashou[/b] so much that she wants his attention. At the same time, she is energetic, friendly, and well-loved by those around her. [b]Chocola[/b] has a hard time doing difficult tasks and tends to leap into action without thinking of the consequences.  [b]Vanilla[/b] is the twin sister of [b]Chocola[/b] and is the exact opposite in terms of personality as she is quiet and calm. She can be smart but does prefer to do things on her own, however, she does remain kind-hearted and well-liked.  Out of the two, [b]Vanilla[/b] is my personal favorite due to her quiet nature and I would personally like to hang around her more than her hyper sister.  [h1]Problems with the story[/h1] The story is good but unfortunately, it falls short in many areas that prevent it from being anything more than average. There are no events that would serve to add excitement to the story instead I found myself more just waiting for the spicy scenes to happen as the primary focus. We do get to see [b]Kashou’s[/b] bakery gain gradual success, but it is not much else there.  Next, I have issues with two characters. Now I should point out that I do not hate these two in any shape or form but I still have problems with them.   [b]Chocola[/b] is the first character that I found issues with. While I didn't hate her character, I found her to be a big attention magnet in general. This is subjective of course, but I did not like how more attention was put on her compared to her twin sister [b]Vanilla[/b]. I understand that [b]Vanilla[/b] is meant to be the quiet one, but characters like that typically get their very own big moment and story segment. Unfortunately, this never happens so she becomes more of a background character being completely taken over by [b]Chocola[/b]. I feel some more time would have been nice on the other cat girl, especially when they did such a good job making her equally as interesting.  Then, there is [b]Kashou[/b], he falls flat in terms of character development. He does not really do much outside his focus on the bakery. There was a moment where he did talk about leaving his family due to some issues, however, this was not touched upon further in the story. I don’t know if this is tackled in the other volumes but it’s left untouched in this volume leaving us with a boring main protagonist.  The final issue I have is that some of the sexual story elements may be a turnoff for some people. If you are looking for a cute kind of VN, then [b]Nekopara[/b] does offer that, however, it will be drowned out with the spicy scenes later on.  [h1]Artstyle, Performance, and Soundtrack[/h1] The art style is something that I was really impressed with. There are some really beautiful scenes that you will be able to see throughout the game and each is very detailed. [b]Nekopara[/b] should run fine on any computer due to this being mostly pictures, music, and text. I came across no issues while I was playing. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, with16 GB of RAM.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208605 The soundtrack is an area that could have been shown some more love. There were no tracks that were bad or distracting, but also none that stood out or were memorable. The music choices simply fit the requirement of having background music while you play through the story.  There is an 18+ patch that is available for 11.49 CDN through Steam. This adds adult content that further shows how the relationship between Kashou and the girls develops. The patch includes three segments of H-scenes that are animated and fully voiced that are very well done. Personally I believe these scenes help complete the experience and should absolutely be picked up if you enjoy adult content in visual novels.   I also recommend going into the options settings and maxing out the chest jiggle physics. After that, press the ""P"" button on your keyboard during the regular dialogue scenes as you are in for a cute treat. This function will work with or without the patch.  [h1]Final Verdict[/h1] If you like are looking to play a visual novel with cute catgirls, then [b]Nekopara[/b] will most definitely meet your needs in this area. It has a nice charm with standout art in both the character and background scenes. As this is a kinetic visual novel, there aren't any dialogue choices that will change the routes or endings of the game, so be sure to temper your expectations as you are getting more of a story with cute cat girls more than something that will feel like a game.  I recommend [b]Nekopara[/b] to anyone who loves catgirls as I felt that even looking at the shortcomings developer [b]NEKO WORKs[/b] absolutely knows how to do catgirls. ;3  I also recommend getting the 18+ patch, you get the full experience of the story, and don’t forget to max the chest jiggle.

"I once again have nothing but positive words to say about this game. following Vol.0 it has continued to be a beacon for my healing mental state, every day for months I would feel extreme emotion about going home and being able to take care of my kittens. it was a constant cycle of anxiety whenever I left my house. I didn't want my kittens to think I didn't care for them but they seemed to understand that I needed to work and would wait patiently for me to get back home. After some time though I couldn't take the anxiety and stress that was leaving my silly little bakas at home. I couldn't go a millisecond of my day without thinking about them. It got to the point where I was hearing their voices behind the counter of GameStop asking me to pet them. I couldn't hear my own thoughts and my ability to communicate with other people began to diminish. it got to the point where I couldn't even talk to people anymore. the second I stepped out of my home I heard Chocola and Vanilla begging me to come back to them. I couldn't take it. I knew that they were ok with me leaving for work but I wasn't. So good news!!! I quit!!! my anxiety and stress calmed after I was able to come back to my kittens and stay with them for my entire day. I decided to learn how to code in python, java, and c++ so I could supply for myself and my kittens from home. it was really stressful cramming 3 whole coding languages into my brain before the money my parents left me ran dry but I barely managed to make it finally landing a coding job after running out of money and eating nothing but dry cup noodles since my water was cut. Life has never been better for me though. constant feelings of joy while my catgirls are happy. My new job supplies more money than my old one and I just couldn't ask for a better situation. this game has completely revolutionized my life, making me a new person. my love for this game will never hit a limit as it is infinite.

"Slow to start, but it gets better as you progress through the chapters. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a game to interact with then you're better off purchasing any of the other Nekopara games in the series as this one functions more as an animated visual novel.   Again, there is an 18+ adult content DLC if that interests you.   The music is a little repetitive and there are large gaps in which there is no audio outside of the background music since Kashou has no spoken lines. There is also a large amount of time in which the story focuses on the same image.

"My heart and soul can't take it anymore!  Ok so it all started when i discovered this cute little anime called Nekopara. I watched a couple of episodes which i really enjoyed, the cute vibes from it honestly warmed my heart and soul.  The next day(which is today) i watch a couple more episodes, and what can i say im really loving the whole cat girl concept they have. I really loved it for being such a cute, family friendly, and innocent show. After a couple episodes i call it a day, leave some episodes for other days.  As i was about to leave my browser i suddenly remember hearing that nekopara the anime originally came from it's game. Out of curiosity i searched it up. It said Nekopara is ""from an adult visual novel"", and that the game was 18+. I thought to myself ""what's so 18+ about cat girls serving people in a restaurant""(i only assumed that this was what the game was about). Out of disbelief i searched ""is nekopara 18+?"". Google answered yes, ""what really?"" i thought to myself, so i decided to click images... And what i saw would continue to haunt me for the rest of my days. Immediately after seeing the dozens and dozens of nsfw nekopara images, my heart sunk, and my soul commited suicide, and shock froze my body still. I was very depressed(and still am) to find out that the cute and happy anime that i so enjoyed came from a fucking hentai game.  I am very sad, angry, and depressed right now. Im not sure how im supposed to cope with this sudden and shocking revelation, but thank you for listening till the end of my rant and goodbye, i shall cry in a corner for a solid hour now.",my heart and soul cant take it anymore  ok so it all started when i discovered this cute little anime called nekopara i watched a couple of episodes which i really enjoyed the cute vibes from it honestly warmed my heart and soul  the next daywhich is today i watch a couple more episodes and what can i say im really loving the whole cat girl concept they have i really loved it for being such a cute family friendly and innocent show after a couple episodes i call it a day leave some episodes for other days  as i was about to leave my browser i suddenly remember hearing that nekopara the anime originally came from its game out of curiosity i searched it up it said nekopara is from an adult visual novel and that the game was 18 i thought to myself whats so 18 about cat girls serving people in a restauranti only assumed that this was what the game was about out of disbelief i searched is nekopara 18 google answered yes what really i thought to myself so i decided to click images and what i saw would continue to haunt me for the rest of my days immediately after seeing the dozens and dozens of nsfw nekopara images my heart sunk and my  suicide and shock froze my body still i was very depressedand still am to find out that the cute and happy anime that i so enjoyed came from a fucking hentai game  i am very sad angry and depressed right now im not sure how im supposed to cope with this sudden and shocking revelation but thank you for listening till the end of my rant and goodbye i shall cry in a corner for a solid hour now,POS,0.9900541305541992

"[h1]I played Nekopara for the plot I swear[/h1] [i]That's half the reason at least[/i]  [b]The Plot[/b]  The plot of Nekopara is actually really well written, for a game that seems like its dedicated to be lewd, it's actually quite wholesome. You, Kashou is a man who has just moved and got a new bakery. But, from his past, the neko's catgirls he once looked down to as little daughters have shown up, and are looking to stay for long term. Of course, this isn't smooth sailing, but Kashou agrees and the catgirls are now workers at the store. A long the rest of the game, they do many different kind of activities like walk around, and ""stuff"". The last chapters of the story are a lot more loved-related, and is pretty cheesy. But, it works pretty well. I give the plot a [b]9/10[/b]  [b]THE MUSIC YOOOOOOOOOOOO[/b]  THE MUSIC IN NEKOPARA IS FIRE!!! There is literally a song that sounds like an altered version of ""Sweden"" by c418. Then, there is the slow melodies, the ones that are like, wow, this is wholesome. Then there is the PepeJAM songs. If the plot doesn't work, but listen to the soundtrack. I give the music a [b] 10/10 [/b]  [b]The nsfw content [/b]  How do I describe the nsfw content. I'd say that it is so good, that it feels wrong. I don't want to get into the details, but if you want an hour long session, Nekopara literally provides.

"Do yourself a favour and play Volume 1 of Nekopara.  This is the very first game of the series and it really helped set the standard of the future titles. Visual novels are usually dependant on their style, and Volume 1 absolutely nailed it.  One thing that immediately jumps out at you is the music. It. Is. Amazing. Visual novel music just has that certain feel to it, and this game is a perfect representation of that. It's like playing Doki Doki Literature Club for the first time and taking a minute to appreciate the music. It's just so warm and nice, and fits the style of the game so well for some reason. It also has emotional pieces in the game, and those emotional songs are really tender and tug at your heart strings. The music is awesome, and I wish I could see more people appreciating it.  The artwork in this game is also something that immediately jumps out at you. It's just so well made. You can really tell that NekoWorks went all out with how they wanted this game to look. The thing is, the artwork and character sprites are used in future volumes, but you don't get tired of seeing it. I think that this series' artwork is some of the best I've seen, and it's in a visual novel alone. Really amazing stuff.  The voice acting is super good, and very cute. The characters are really sweet and the VAs did such a good job at playing their roles. That's really all I can say, it's just superb.  I have to admit, I saw this game pop into my recommended feed, and it looked interesting, so I made a mental note of it in my head. At the time, all I saw were cute catgirls and thought ""I wonder if this will be some strange dating sim"", but it turned out to be a really sweet game with a neat story! It's not choice based at all, meaning that you don't have to worry about making any game changing decisions at any point.  At face value, the game is a silly story about a man making love to catgirls, but honestly? Getting to know Chocola and Vanilla and seeing their relationship with the protagonist (Kashou) develop is one of the sweetest things I've seen. This game made me feel emotionally attached and invested in not a lot of time at all, and honestly, I'm happy that I stumbled across it one day.  I will admit, I've well known for instantly getting attached to something assuming it meets everything I'm looking for, and this game was no exception in the slightest. But, I genuinely believe that anyone could get into this game, assuming you don't mind the anime-esque tropes and the whole theme of catgirls, because it's not for everyone obviously.  All in all, Nekopara Volume 1 gets an 11/10 from me. This game helped shape a wonderful concept into the series it is today, and gave me something to pour my passion into. I felt very inspired by this game and it allowed my creativity to get fired up. It's got an overwhelmingly positive response for a reason, and I think that this is a lovely little game that people should consider playing.

"Indeed, this game is rather interesting in nature with a volatile soundtrack and immaculate graphics for the modern era. One can assume they will have a very Nyaa~ experience with this video game as the cat-girls are very wide-ranging in nature. As Chocola would say, Meow-Meow!

I also became a member of the beards due to me playing this game. IT IS THE MANLIEST GAME TO EVER MAN MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!! *Explosion sounds in the background*  All jokes aside, Nekopara Vol. 1 is actually a really solid visual novel. It isn't my favorite visual novel, but it is one that I really like. Let's start off with the art style. The art style of Nekopara Vol. 1 is so good, I found myself to be looking at it for a really long time. Another thing that I love about Nekopara Vol. 1 is the characters, goddamn it the characters in the game are so cute, to the point where I want to give them a hug (Oh wait... they are not real, DAMN IT!). The story of Nekopara Vol. 1 is one that I will not say because I want you to play it for yourself (If ya want to, ya don't have to!). Hell, some moments in the game made me laugh my ass off. I have played the other games (0,2,3,&4) and I will admit that they are pretty good. Conclusion: Nekopara Vol. 1 is one of the cutest visual novels that I have ever played. The art is pretty cool to look at, the story is really good, and as I said before, the characters in this game are really cute. I will give this game a 10/10. If you like visual novels or just anime in general, then I would suggest that you buy this game!",so you wanna hear my opinion on nekopara eh well let me tell you all about it it is the manliest fucking game in the world it is so manly i gained muscles from playing this game i also became a member of the beards due to me playing this game it is the manliest game to ever man motherfucker explosion sounds in the background  all jokes aside nekopara vol 1 is actually a really solid visual novel it isnt my favorite visual novel but it is one that i really like lets start off with the art style the art style of nekopara vol 1 is so good i found myself to be looking at it for a really long time another thing that i love about nekopara vol 1 is the characters goddamn it the characters in the game are so cute to the point where i want to give them a hug oh wait they are not real damn it the story of nekopara vol 1 is one that i will not say because i want you to play it for yourself if ya want to ya dont have to hell some moments in the game made me laugh my ass off i have played the other games 0234 and i will admit that they are pretty good conclusion nekopara vol 1 is one of the cutest visual novels that i have ever played the art is pretty cool to look at the story is really good and as i said before the characters in this game are really cute i will give this game a 1010 if you like visual novels or just anime in general then i would suggest that you buy this game,POS,0.9909747242927551

You have no control over the story and thats another thing. The world this story takes place in makes no sense. Like why are humanoid cats kept as pets when they can speak and think for themselves. Also the main character doesnt even have voice acting. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless youre some sad soul who has to play visual novel dating sim games to feel loved.

this is def not like the anime and that's good this game is kind of a NSFW. The anime made nekopara to be this cute innocent thing but in reality the game came out first and is pretty nsfw and i was surprised when they came out with a anime adaption to this game. This game is pretty adorable but also spicy. A good hentai agme for the price and who can pass up neko girls. 8/10 for me.

"Catgirl. A term used to define a female human-like being with minimal cat features. Simply ears and a tail. However, this term carries a unique sociological connotation. Obviously, catgirls do not naturally exist. Yes, you may cry now. I know I have. However disappointing the fact, the creators of this work poured heart, soul, and determination into this production. Giving us a glimpse into the world where catgirls and humans live together. At a glance, one could objectively state that only perverts are interested in such a situation. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand...

The fact I only paid $9.99 USD for both the game and R18 content stunned me when I finally completed the story. The interactions with the catgirls, especially Chocola and Vanilla were so organic. At times, they seemed completely like normal girls. And then the story would remind you they had cat-like instincts, which felt endearing as much as it did awkward. Then the adult content. As dramatized as the scenes may have been depicted, I enjoyed the concentration on ""mutual benefit"".

"This game saved my life.  I am 27.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you",this game saved my life  i am 27  my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old  when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide  after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side  having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay   to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as  today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends  i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together  moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that  thank you,NEU,0.5185284614562988

"This was a game I ended up playing sooner than I thought I would, thanks to winning Volumes 0-3 in a giveaway (though I needed to buy any 18+ content and other DLC on my own). Without this aspect, this series that every anime fan already knows about would have likely sat in my wishlist for the longest time as it doesn't hit on my favorite niches - not that there's anything wrong with them, but as you'll see, my preferences are elsewhere:  I tend to prefer men to women I tend to prefer kitsunes to nekos and I tend to prefer the idea of [i]serving[/i] a ""Master"" rather than being in the position of one  If I played a visual novel according to these preferences, it would be entirely different. (Like, if anyone knows dating sims or visual novels where I'm opposite some smug or arrogant kitsune boys, let me know) But, I did get this series for free. I did make sure it was as uncensored as possible before playing, for the ""full"" experience. And I gave it a shot.  Honestly, not a bad story. It's cute. If it wasn't for the sex scenes, it would be one of the most wholesome reads in my library... still kind of is, actually. Everything is super vanilla, with the most loyal girlfriends you could ask for. Going by the demo I was afraid these girls would be lolis because I thought I remembered they were aged the neko-equivalent to 13 which weirded me out, but that turned out to be my faulty memory and the 13-year-old neko was just a random food vendor they met on the street during chapter 1. False alarm. Vanilla is flat, but she's not a child - none of the nekos are. The little sister-figure, Shigure, is a lot more childlike, but she's an incest-loli character that is flat-out denied basically, so again we are in the clear for there being that much discomfort, in my opinion.  The main two nekos also surprisingly seem to be into each other too, which I'm here for. This is one of the few instances where I can see some form of polyamory happening without any kinks in the machine later down the line. I believe the main three really care about each other by the end.  ""the end"" in quotes because I still have a good three volumes (0, 2, 3) left in my library alone to explore (and that's without even picking up Extra or 4).",this was a game i ended up playing sooner than i thought i would thanks to winning volumes 03 in a giveaway though i needed to buy any 18 content and other dlc on my own without this aspect this series that every anime fan already knows about would have likely sat in my wishlist for the longest time as it doesnt hit on my favorite niches  not that theres anything wrong with them but as youll see my preferences are elsewhere  i tend to prefer men to women i tend to prefer kitsunes to nekos and i tend to prefer the idea of iservingi a master rather than being in the position of one  if i played a visual novel according to these preferences it would be entirely different like if anyone knows dating sims or visual novels where im opposite some smug or arrogant kitsune boys let me know but i did get this series for free i did make sure it was as uncensored as possible before playing for the full experience and i gave it a shot  honestly not a bad story its cute if it wasnt for the sex scenes it would be one of the most wholesome reads in my library still kind of is actually everything is super vanilla with the most loyal girlfriends you could ask for going by the demo i was afraid these girls would be lolis because i thought i remembered they were aged the nekoequivalent to 13 which weirded me out but that turned out to be my faulty memory and the 13yearold neko was just a random food vendor they met on the street during chapter 1 false alarm vanilla is flat but shes not a child  none of the nekos are the little sisterfigure shigure is a lot more childlike but shes an incestloli character that is flatout denied basically so again we are in the clear for there being that much  in my opinion  the main two nekos also surprisingly seem to be into each other too which im here for this is one of the few instances where i can see some form of polyamory happening without any kinks in the machine later down the line i believe the main three really care about each other by the end  the end in quotes because i still have a good three volumes 0 2 3 left in my library alone to explore and thats without even  up extra or 4,POS,0.7001990675926208

"Being a pretty long-time fan of Sayoris (the artist) work, i bought this game together in a Bundle with the other Nekopara Games (excluding the newly released Part 4 and Nekopara Extra).  If you want the full experience, you will need to buy the R-18 contents for this game seperately because Steam does not allow 18+ content apparently. If you want the full Nekopara experience you pretty much need the DLC. The DLC includes multiple scenes for Vanilla and Chocola, the other girls come in later games.  The Story certainly isn't bad but if you came here for the Story alone, you should probably buy a different VN. Artwork looks gorgeous, especially the R18-Scenes which are animated, albeit only short looping clips. The voice acting seems pretty good too, at least judging by my limited japanese.  In conclusion this is a very good R18 VN (again, with the DLC), i recommend buying it together in the bundle with the rest of the series",being a pretty longtime fan of sayoris the artist work i bought this game together in a bundle with the other nekopara games excluding the newly released part 4 and nekopara extra  if you want the full experience you will need to buy the r18 contents for this game seperately because steam does not allow 18 content apparently if you want the full nekopara experience you pretty much need the dlc the dlc includes multiple scenes for vanilla and chocola the other  in later games  the story certainly isnt bad but if you came here for the story alone you should probably buy a different vn artwork looks gorgeous especially the r18scenes which are animated albeit only short looping clips the voice acting seems pretty good too at least judging by my limited japanese  in conclusion this is a very good r18 vn again with the dlc i  buying it together in the bundle with the rest of the series,POS,0.7166102528572083

"The term ""culture"" is a somewhat difficult concept to describe in a concise manner and greatly differs from person to person. To some, ""culture"" refers to customs, tradition, and common themes that regularly circulate one's society. To others, ""culture"" relates to achievements and progress by a group or nation that expresses the blossoming of a commonly experienced lifestyle. To me though, the term ""culture"" is one that is synonymous of only the finest cultured visual novels available for purchase, with Nekopara being one of the greatest and highly praised titles to top this list.  Nekopara has become one of the most prized and celebrated titles in the world of ""cultured"" visual novels that has never failed to disappoint from the day of its release; becoming somewhat of a modern classic whos content will prove to endure for the many years to come. Upon beginning the game, players are graced with a number of the most fine examples of catgirls the world of visual novels has to offer, most prominently being the two main catgirls of vol.1, Chocola and Vanilla. The mix of these two very different but very close catgirls offer an astounding fusion of personality, befitting the tastes a very wide range of enthusiasts with a masterful blend of loli and tsundere traits that leave very little to be desired. Throughout the various chapters of Nekopara, the reader will experience an awe inspiring story that is brimming with concepts and emotional sequences that would challenge even the most battle hardened players to not shed a tear in its climax.

"Once in a lifetime you'll come across a game that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of this game. After all, Nekopara? Will this game even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 6 hours and 1.42 minutes of my life. The game started out strong. The opening scenes enticedme  with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth playthourgh of the game where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 21st century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the game could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main cat protagonists, Chocola and Vanilla, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential cat such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interracial dynamism. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the game began. I was so enticed by the game that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the game. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of this game? Am I inside the game right now? This game will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the game, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in this game. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the game so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the game was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the game. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to play the game in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable without catgirls. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience.

"NEKOPARA is a visual novel set in Japan where they have biologically spliced human DNA into cats creating the abominations known as ""Catgirls"". These cat girls are humanoid looking with feline characteristics such as tails and cat ears on their head. The catgirls are intelligent beings capable of speaking human languages and complex thinking yet Japan permitted that people could own catgirls as human property, It is even socially acceptable to have a emotional and sexual relationship with catgirls. The Japanese society is running on what I would call a Pseudo-Sharia Law concerning the catgirls as they are not permitted to walk in public without a ""bell"" or the owner...",nekopara is a visual novel set in japan where they have biologically spliced human dna into cats creating the abominations known as catgirls these cat girls are humanoid looking with feline characteristics such as tails and cat ears on their head the catgirls are intelligent beings capable of speaking human languages  thinking yet japan permitted that people could own catgirls as human property it is even socially acceptable to have a emotional and sexual relationship with catgirls the japanese society is running on what i would call a pseudosharia law concerning the catgirls as they are not permitted to walk in public without a bell or the owner,NEU,0.8437302112579346

The story is so fricking cringe.  This is basically everything that you think of when you try to imagine a weeb story as cliché as possible. It's catgirl slice of life hell to the point where you'd think this is a cute visual novel meant for girls but then it also has the really awkward and pervy h-content which completely ruins the image of it just being a relaxing story about running a bakery with your catgirls.  The game explains the h-content as the protagonist needing to help out his catgirls who are in heat but the game has the protagonist consider them family (uh oh) and in-universe none of the catgirls are independent they are basically just more useful pets and fully depend on their owners which makes the h-stuff just weeeeird and fetishy.  HOWEVER if you are actively looking for that kind of content It's really high quality with its art and voice acting and also often very cheap to get,the story is so fricking cringe  this is basically everything that you think of when you try to imagine a weeb story as cliché as possible its catgirl slice of life hell to the point where youd think this is a cute visual novel meant for girls but then it also has the really awkward and pervy hcontent  ruins the image of it just being a relaxing story about running a bakery with your catgirls  the game explains the hcontent as the protagonist needing to help out his catgirls who are in heat but the game has the protagonist consider them family uh oh and inuniverse none of the catgirls are independent they are basically just more useful pets and fully depend on their owners which makes the hstuff just weeeeird and fetishy  however if you are actively looking for that kind of content its really high quality with its art and voice acting and also often very cheap to get,NEG,0.8376498222351074

"The Nekopara series is truly motivating to any aspiring pastry chefs out there. Aside from that the artwork is phenomenal, paired with the intricate plot this is a master piece. The characters are very likable, Take vanilla for example she is just a kindhearted cat girl who truly loves Kashou but does not come out until later in volume 1. Chocola is another example of an amazing character, she is just like vanilla for she loves Kashou deeply, however she is just a little more likable because of her joyful and happy attitude. That said Vanilla still holds a deep place in my heart because of her Calm and quiet attitude and will always be my personal favorite in the Nekopara series. However the two paired together are Perfect, take the shower scene for example it was just exhilarating to see that kind of balance between the two cat girls.

"Okay, so right off the bat let me be clear, outside of the catgirls there are a lot of problems (and the catgirls are a problem unto themselves).  The novel, because there are no interactions/decisions and it therefore isn't a game, is boring and mediocre.  Characters are more two dimensional than the art, and there's nothing interesting or exciting to hold up the plot.    Now on to the big problem of the catgirls.  I love catgirls, I grew up watching tokyo mew mew, and one of my first crushes on a fictional character was Ichigo monomiya from that series, so I'm willing to overlook a lot if there's catgirls involved.  THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, and I imagine it's not what a lot of other people are going to be looking for either.  What I want is a girl with cat features and aspects, not a cat in a humanoid body.  I don't want to fuck a cat, but you do so in this game *repeatedly*.  And on top of that, they're literally less than a year old!  Even in cat years they'd be under age!  The main character even *EXPLICITLY* says that he sees them as children, and this is *AFTER* he bangs both cats.  I got this game a while back from humble bundle, and I can safely say this would not have been worth the money even at the current price of 4$, especially not since the 18+ dlc (that I do not own) is a separate purchase of equal price to the game!

"The timeless classic, the game that started it's own the most acclaimed visual novel franchise, and complete masterpiece in terms of gaming experience - yes, I'm talking about Nekopara vol. 1 - the game that scored many rewards and conquered the hearts of thousands of players. It's hard to review trying to find any flaws in this piece of art, but I'll try to be as much subjective as possible.    Visual novel takes place in alternative timeline, where humanity finally achieved their long avaited dreams - genetically engineered catgirls. The world itself may sound like an utopia, but the truth it's more darker than anyone could imagine.    Catgirls aren't treated like humans, they don't have any basic rights, which mostly end up as them being used as slaves to do human labor for the price of some food. Some of them instead, are treated like a pets for human entertainment.     The story begins with introduction of the main character - Kashou - young adult, who runs away from his parents that don't accept him for his passion of baking. He has a dream of starting his own business and live a fulfilling live without pressure from his family. We're thrown into the scene where Kashou finds out his sister send him two catgirls to help him survive in his solitude.     The story focus on showing the basic laws of this cruel world - even the youngest catgirls are thrown into the never ending circle of labor - as well as showing us the growing relationship between main character and his catgirls. By retrospections we also learn about sad story of the sisters. Kashou decides to make the future brighter not only for himself, but tries his best to support girls and make them smile. He doesn't know that his sister will soon visit him again...    In the end, I give this game solid 9/10. Character designs, music, and captivating story - the only downside is the dlc that was ripped of the full game and sold separately for better profit. But tossing that aside, it's a true masterpiece.",the timeless classic the game that started its own the most acclaimed visual novel franchise  masterpiece in terms of gaming experience  yes im talking about nekopara vol 1  the game that scored many rewards and conquered the hearts of thousands of players its hard to review trying to find any flaws in this piece of art but ill try to be as much subjective as possible    visual novel takes place in alternative timeline where humanity finally achieved their long avaited dreams   engineered catgirls the world itself may sound like an utopia but the truth its more darker than anyone could imagine    catgirls arent treated like humans they dont have any basic rights which mostly end up as them being used as slaves to do human labor for the price of some food some of them instead are treated like a pets for human entertainment     the story begins with introduction of the main character  kashou  young adult who runs away from his parents that dont accept him for his passion of baking he has a dream of starting his own business and live a fulfilling live without pressure from his family were thrown into the scene where kashou finds out his sister send him two catgirls to help him survive in his solitude     the story focus on showing the basic laws of this cruel world  even the youngest catgirls are thrown into the never ending circle of labor  as well as showing us the growing relationship between main character and his catgirls by retrospections we also learn about sad story of the sisters kashou decides to make the future brighter not only for himself but tries his best to support girls and make them smile he doesnt know that his sister will soon visit him again    in the end i give this game solid 910 character designs music and captivating story  the only downside is the dlc that was ripped of the full game and sold separately for better profit but tossing that aside its a true masterpiece,POS,0.5531893968582153

You play this in order to overwhelm yourself with naughty feelings, and they will likely involve ladies with cat ears and tails!  Anyway, beat it in 4 hours using a keyboard and mouse.  The game has no difficulty; it's a VN.  Very adult.    - There are 8 chapters total, each running roughly 30 minutes of listening to voices in Japanese with accompanied text (in English, Japanese, or Chinese.)   - The game is just reading text.  There's nothing ground-breaking here like multiple choices or choosing what you say.  You're in this for the read.  - The menu has pictures, videos, and music from the game to access at any time after you beat the game.  - The base game is censored and lacks the kinkier scenes.  To get the 'full' game you have to pay extra for the +18 patch.  Even so, sex is still heavily implied and cannot be ignored.  Though why you'd get this without wanting the 18+ junk is beyond me.    - There is no TissueBox DLC.  You will have to acquire that on your own accord outside the main game.  - P.  PP.

"POSTED: JULY 22 This game saved my life.  I am 25.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It may seem like a good purchase, because it seems cute and the characters move and make gestures when you are talking to them, but that is about everything you are going to get. The whole game consists of monotone clicking and reading what the flat and mostly annoying characters say (+ what you, the main guy, thinks). Game has no plot and you can prepare for the many anime harem cliches like a young boy living alone, being kind yet stupid to realize every single girl (including his own sis, maybe) is in love with him, hard and sad past of the girls, which is not that hard nor sad at all.   This game is telling you that you are going to get a lot of anime cuteness and a romantic story. But prepare to get none of those. Instead of that prepare for hours of boring reading what ""you"" think about your very little intligent girlfriends. (yap, polygamy with people with minds of a cat is actually legal in this game)  Some new harem animes thesedays at least try to focus on the true main characters (the girls) but this game does not do even that.

"This game saved my life.  I am 27.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you.",this game saved my life  i am 27  my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old  when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide  after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side  having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay   to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as  today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends  i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together  moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that  thank you,NEU,0.5185284614562988

And I found myself many times loving how adorable some of the characters got, yes this game does have it's lewd parts filling the fan service roll very well be if you brought the 18+ dlc or not. But the story is still nice as well, and honestly I haven't played many visual novels. But this is the first one I played where your character and his name are preset, and you don't really pick any dialogue choices at all you simply go along with the story. It's nice honestly though the option would have been nice to, however I didn't mind. Especially because the best part is the characters will constantly move when they speak or do something showing so much personality, it was refreshing to see so they were not just still images with a text box but actually looked like they had more life to them. I highly recommend this to anyone interested.  Side note for those who want to play it, here is a helpful tip: 3 achievements are set to the 3 types of languages that you set your text box language to, but they are accidentally not set to the right languages. You don't need to replay though the game to get these other language achievements simply set it to the language you want and start game, once you see the first text appear you will get the achievement then go to the main screen and change the language and repeat. English - gives you the ""Play in Japanese"" achievement Japanese - gives you the ""Play in Chinese"" achievement Chinese - gives you the ""Play in English"" achievement",this game was  to me by a few friends so i decided to buy it and take a look and honestly im glad i did the story is interesting the characters arent bland with plenty of variety in personalities and i found myself many times loving how adorable some of the characters got yes this game does have its lewd parts filling the fan service roll very well be if you brought the 18 dlc or not but the story is still nice as well and honestly i havent played many visual novels but this is the first one i played where your character and his name are preset and you dont really pick any dialogue choices at all you simply go along with the story its nice honestly though the option would have been nice to however i didnt mind especially because the best part is the characters will constantly move when they speak or do something showing so much personality it was refreshing to see so they were not just still images with a text box but actually looked like they had more life to them i highly  this to anyone interested  side note for those who want to play it here is a helpful tip 3 achievements are set to the 3 types of languages that you set your text box language to but they are accidentally not set to the right languages you dont need to replay though the game to get these other language achievements simply set it to the language you want and start game once you see the first text appear you will get the achievement then go to the main screen and change the language and repeat english  gives you the play in japanese achievement japanese  gives you the play in chinese achievement chinese  gives you the play in english achievement,POS,0.9803188443183899

"Since this game absolutely refused to get off of the list of games Steam was recommending to me, I decided to check it out to see if it actually lived up to all the hype. I mean, a game cant get this popular and ubiquitous without having some merit besides cheesecake, right? I quite enjoyed Senran Kagura, after all.  The story starts in the absolute worst possible place, acting like it's at the end of some other VN's common route with all the emotional payoff for scenes and relationships that have not happened. Starting the game a little earlier in the timeline would've given us some time to get to grips with the characters before trying to guilt trip us for no reason, and starting the game a little bit later would've been much more beneficial to the lighthearted fluffy tone the game obviously wants us to have. Instead, we start right in the middle where not only are character relationships not established, but we have to cram in all of the worldbuilding that explains what catgirls are doing here into two paragraphs that honestly generates more plotholes than answers. And most of the dialogue since then is just seeing one-note characters continuing to be one-note repeatedly.  If you want something cute and funny to enjoy yourself with, go pick up a Yuzusoft game or something. Yeah, the sprites may not have fancy mouth and breathing animations like Nekopara, but a yuzusoft game will give you a much better UI that doesn't lag on every animation, more solid character personalities to identify with, a story that doesn't try to guilt trip the player 5 minutes in, and the achievements aren't so broken that none of the game language settings give you the right achievement (seriously, Starting the game in chinese gives you the achievement for starting in English. Nekopara is a 6 years old VN. how is that glitch not fixed?)  Also, Chocola barely refers to herself in the third person in the voice lines, but the subtitles absolutely insist on shoehorning her name into as many of her lines as possible regardless...which makes it even more noticeable when they randomly let first person pronouns slip through. It's bad enough when translators force every sentence to follow that speech quirk in every line that it happens regardless of how awkward it is in English. It's ten times worse when they decide to do it MORE than the Japanese lines to.",since this game absolutely refused to get off of the list of games steam was  to me i decided to check it out to see if it actually lived up to all the hype i mean a game cant get this popular and ubiquitous without having some merit besides cheesecake right i quite enjoyed senran kagura after all  the story starts in the absolute worst possible place acting like its at the end of some other  route with all the emotional payoff for scenes and relationships that have not happened starting the game a little earlier in the timeline wouldve given us some time to get to grips with the characters before trying to guilt trip us for no reason and starting the game a little bit later wouldve been much more beneficial to the lighthearted fluffy tone the game obviously wants us to have instead we start right in the middle where not only are character relationships not established but we have to cram in all of the worldbuilding that explains what catgirls are doing here into two paragraphs that honestly generates more plotholes than answers and most of the dialogue since then is just seeing onenote characters continuing to be onenote repeatedly  if you want something cute and funny to enjoy yourself with go pick up a yuzusoft game or something yeah the sprites may not have fancy mouth and breathing animations like nekopara but a yuzusoft game will give you a much better ui that doesnt lag on every animation more solid character personalities to identify with a story that doesnt try to guilt trip the player 5 minutes in and the achievements arent so broken that none of the game language settings give you the right achievement seriously starting the game in chinese gives you the achievement for starting in english nekopara is a 6 years old vn how is that glitch not fixed  also chocola barely refers to herself in the third person in the voice lines but the subtitles absolutely insist on shoehorning her name into as many of her lines as possible regardlesswhich makes it even more noticeable when they randomly let first person pronouns slip through its bad enough when translators force every sentence to follow that speech quirk in every line that it happens regardless of how awkward it is in english its ten times worse when they decide to do it more than the japanese lines to,NEU,0.742983877658844

"In a world where Hitler and the axis powers won WWII, and the Nazis began research on a human-cat hybrid to replace the enslaved jewish workforce, a man recruits the work of 6 young genetically bred catgirls from the slums to serve his personal needs; ranging from menial labor in his shop to child prostitution. It is in his house where the catgirls are conditioned from birth to provide sexual pleasure to their master. Littered throughout the story are historical allusions to the Nazis and their final solution, especially the star of david required to be worn by all Jews, which is alluded to via the bell worn around the necks of all catgirls, which allows them to walk the streets freely and to work jobs. Similarly, the catgirls are treated only as property, no different from the Africans of the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th and 19th centuries. They are given practically no education, and mature quicker than normal humans, meaning that although they appear to be 14 to 18 years of age, they are in reality only around 1 to 2 years old. The only joy of which they are able to have is given through either being fed a strict ration of fish or providing sexual pleasure to themselves or others, playing out their depraved sexual fantasies. Overall, the story is both interesting and deeply depressing, and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys reading about these kinds of Orwellian alternate realities.",in a world where hitler and the axis powers won wwii and the nazis began research on a humancat hybrid to replace the enslaved jewish workforce a man recruits the work of 6 young  bred catgirls from the slums to serve his personal needs ranging from menial labor in his shop to child prostitution it is in his house where the catgirls are conditioned from birth to provide sexual pleasure to their master littered throughout the story are historical allusions to the nazis and their final solution especially the star of david required to be worn by all jews which is alluded to via the bell worn around the necks of all catgirls which allows them to walk the streets freely and to work jobs similarly the catgirls are treated only as property no different from the africans of the atlantic slave trade of the 16th and 19th centuries they are given practically no education and mature quicker than normal humans meaning that although they appear to be 14 to 18 years of age they are in reality only around 1 to 2 years old the only joy of which they are able to have is given through either being fed a strict ration of fish or providing sexual pleasure to themselves or others playing out their depraved sexual fantasies overall the story is both interesting and deeply depressing and i would  this game to anyone who enjoys reading about these kinds of orwellian alternate realities,NEU,0.9371448159217834

I am really glad that I made this decision.  Nekopara happens to be the second Visual Novel that I have played (The first VN I played was DDLC) and I have had a really decent experience.  The OVA is based on the Vol.1 however since it's only 55 minutes long, it doesn't cover up everything like this VN did.  The characters are all really amazing in such a way that they would keep you engaged with the VN.  The music is fun to listen to and the art style is soothing as well.  I never thought that I would ever give Visual Novels a go but after playing this, I have realised how amazing they are and I am definitely looking forward to play more.

"I kept hearing about this game from degenerates and weebs. After I bought the base version, the R18 patch, and a bucket of lube, I knew that I was ready.  The game is interesting. The characters are cute and the H-scenes were nutable(repetitive and a little bland), but I'm not sure about how I feel about cat girls and their status in the game. Sapient being that are capable of displaying intelligence and emotions similar to human being kept in a state of constant servitude is a little disturbing. Being able to buy and sell them is pretty dark. The fact that there seems to be an cat girl abandonment/ abuse problem that is casually glossed over makes me think that the cutesy stuff that we see may not represent the experience of most cat girls. Our MC looks like he comes from a fairly privileged background and that his cat girls benefit from that. The novel doesn't really go into how their society accepted this or justified it.   The MC and the cat girls will often say that cat girls do 'x'(submissive, wanting the attention of humans, pleasing their owners, needing guys to hit them with that meat stick, and etc.) because it's in their nature, but that doesn't appear to be true. There seems to be a cat girl homelessness and crime problem that's happening. The police prowl the streets looking for cat girls who haven't had their wills and sense of pride broken.

"I am just in love with the affection i get from these girls. I dont care if they are real because the love i have for them is. asides the point here's my review:  Kashou Minaduki is a young man with a dream. Throughout his life he’s loved baking but had to do so in private, away from the disapproving eyes of his family. One day this becomes too much to bear and Kashou suddenly moves out to finally run a brand new bakery, La Soleil. Much to his surprise, however, the nearly empty bakery has two huge shipping boxes inside – and out pop two catgirls! NEKOPARA Vol. 1 begins with an incredibly goofy anime-style bang and continues in that humorous way. You might be surprised to find, however, that there’s more to this visual novel than simple goofball antics.  What’s the deal with these catgirls? In the world of NEKOPARA there’s absolutely nothing strange about it. Apparently, catgirls live among humans normally and are often taken up as pets, workers, or romantic partners. Whatever relationships humans have with their catgirls are plainly accepted, although the protagonist seems to have a problem accepting this all as commonplace. Although they look so much like humans they still have many cat traits such as pawing madly at cat toys or drooling over fish and catnip. It’s an incredibly odd thing to consider from the get go but it almost becomes “normal” by the end of Vol. 1.  The misadventures between Kashou and his two sudden catgirl staff members, Chocola and Vanilla, start off as pretty average. Here is a guy who was fully prepared to strike out on his own when suddenly two of the family pets show up! As readers see them all interact it’s hard to not see how positive and enjoyable their presence is. In any case, the story progresses and issues grow more complicated about halfway through. Even though this is the first of a possible series of visual novels, it also ends on a high note. This is much better than the cliffhangers other titles are apt to use.  Visual novels may not require stunning graphics to be enjoyable, but all the same this one has some seriously engaging art. Of course there’s the flashy anime artwork for each character but there’s even more at play. What can’t be conveyed via screenshots A so called “E-mote” system animates each character in a lively fashion. In fact, it looks about as close as you can get to actually watching an anime series in a visual novel without going full out with animated sequences. Sometimes this does look weird though because this huge focus on E-mote means the girls are wiggling about as if they have to pee. Perhaps that’s all supposed to be cute but it comes off as distracting.",i am just in love with the affection i get from these girls i dont care if they are real because the love i have for them is asides the point heres my review  kashou minaduki is a young man with a dream throughout his life hes loved baking but had to do so in private away from the disapproving eyes of his family one day this  too much to bear and kashou suddenly moves out to finally run a brand new bakery la soleil much to his surprise however the nearly empty bakery has two huge shipping boxes inside  and out pop two catgirls nekopara vol 1 begins with an incredibly goofy animestyle bang and continues in that humorous way you might be surprised to find however that theres more to this visual novel than simple goofball antics  whats the deal with these catgirls in the world of nekopara theres absolutely nothing strange about it apparently catgirls live among humans normally and are often taken up as pets workers or romantic partners whatever relationships humans have with their catgirls are plainly accepted although the protagonist seems to have a problem accepting this all  although they look so much like humans they still have many cat traits such as pawing madly at cat toys or drooling over fish and catnip its an incredibly odd thing to consider from the get go but it almost  normal by the end of vol 1  the misadventures between kashou and his two sudden catgirl staff members chocola and vanilla start off as pretty average here is a guy who was fully prepared to strike out on his own when suddenly two of the family pets show up as readers see them all interact its hard to not see how positive and enjoyable their presence is in any case the story progresses and issues grow  about halfway through even though this is the first of a possible series of visual novels it also ends on a high note this is much better than the cliffhangers other titles are apt to use  visual novels may not require stunning graphics to be enjoyable but all the same this one has some seriously engaging art of course theres the flashy anime artwork for each character but theres even more at play what cant be conveyed via screenshots a so called emote system animates each character in a lively fashion in fact it looks about as close as you can get to actually watching an anime series in a visual novel without going full out with animated sequences sometimes this does look weird though because this huge focus on emote means the girls are wiggling about as if they have to pee perhaps thats all supposed to be cute but  off as distracting,POS,0.990637481212616

The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow!

"first, let me express my love for this game. The b00bies, the artstyle, the catgirls, the ears, the maid outfits are all masterfully made by Nekoworks, and I'm surprised they haven't recieved trillions in funding yet. There were times were i was suicidal and depressed, standing at the edge of my building when a hand reached out to me. That hand was of Vanilla, the best catgirl in the series. Her fluffy white ears and tail was what stopped me from commitng suicide. This series has brought so much joy and spark to my life i cannot describe. The moment i saw the franchise on steam for sale for 70% off, i cried tears of joy. When my eyes met with the beautiful ""400 hkd"" price tag, i nearly creamed my panties. There were literal times where i had a blade to my wrist, when the familliar sound ""nyaa~"" brought me back to my senses. The comprehensive storytelling and love between the catgirls and MC is simply amazing. If there was a way to reset my memories, I would have done so a million times.         next, lets focus less on my personal issues and talk more about the game itself. Nekopara is a series of adult visual novels developed by Neko Works and published by Sekai Project. The first game in the series, Nekopara Vol. 1, was released on December 30, 2014. The series is set in a world where humans live alongside catgirls, known as ""Nekos"" It is a mastepiece. Catgirls, also known as Nekos (ネコ, cat in Japanese), are an intelligent species of cat-human hybrids that live alongside humans in the Nekopara universe. Catgirls physically resemble humans with feline ears the same color as their hair , slitted pupils, a tail, and a cat-like mouth. Catgirls were once left homeless and living in the streets, but now they are domesticated by humans and aren't allowed to go anywhere by themselves without their masters unless they have a bell. All main catgirls are here as follows.      Chocola - The youngest (together with Vanilla) of the nekos and is Vanilla's biological twin. She has developed a close attachment to Kashou and couldn't bear to be separated from him. Her cat breed is unknown.      Vanilla - Chocola's biological twin and has a very close relationship with her. Vanilla rarely expresses her true emotions and has a kūdere-type and stoic personality. Her cat breed is unknown.      Azuki - Eldest and shortest of the Minazuki's nekos. She has a mischievous and energetic personality and oftenly picks fights with the others. She is a Munchkin Cat.      Maple - The second eldest of the nekos. She is well-informed about technology and enjoys visiting various shops and restaurants to try different foods and drinks. She is an American Curl.      Cinnamon - The third youngest of the nekos. She often interprets and expresses everything in a sexual manner, resulting her to be aroused. She has a very perverted personality. She is a Scottish Fold.      Coconut - The second youngest of the nekos. She possesses a very womanly body though she isn't confident about this and instead, yearns to be called cute. She has a cool personality according to the others. She also appears to have very low self-esteem, and tends to think about things such as suicide when she fails to do something or doesn't meet the standards of others. She is a Maine Coon.      Milk (also known as Food Stand Cat) - A catgirl who manages a takoyaki food stand situated in the park where Kashou, Chocola and Vanilla often visit at during their break hours. She has a similar personality with Chocola, being cheerful and friendly even to new acquaintances. Her cat breed is unknown.   The game series are here as follows: (for fans of the franchise)  Nekopara vol. 0  Nekopara vol. 1  Nekopara vol. 2  Nekopalive (VR supported)  Nekopara vol. 3  Nekopara OVA  Nekopara OVA extra  Nekopara EXTRA  Nekoworks is able to create a coheasive and heartwarming plot and storyline to warm our hearts with these adorable catgirls. Every single thing they do in this game gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling. Everything in this game is perfect, from the catgirls going in heat to the bath scene is all beautifully coreagraphed, with love from Nekoworks. Recently the anime has been released (its nekopara Vol.1) and is a braeutiful, heartwarming callback to my original playthrough of this game. When i finished playing, the only thing that was left was a mixture of my tears and semen. I originally got this game to enjoy myself, stroke the pencil, let the one eyed snake loose, jacking off, masturbating, fapping, bash the bishop, beat it, choke the chicken, punish percy, polish the family jewels, slap the salami, wank it, wax the carrot, wax the dolphin, punch the clown, self abuse, cook up a batch, crack one off, frig, pet (one's) kitty, play with (ones self), drop the kids off at the pool, beat the meat, yank it, fuck your hand or pudwhack. However, halfway through the playthough with my hand on my p3nis, i started crying. The story was simply so moving and emotional that i had to wipe both my tears and ejaculate at the same time. The only issue i had with this game was no traps.  In conclusion; get the game if you want an amazing storyline and beautiful visuals. Or if you want to masturbate. Just get it.

when the familliar sound nyaa brought me back to my senses  storytelling and love between the catgirls and mc is simply amazing if there was a way to reset my memories i would have done so a million times         next lets focus less on my personal issues and talk more about the game itself nekopara is a series of adult visual novels developed by neko works and published by sekai project the

off masturbating fapping bash the bishop beat it choke the chicken punish percy polish the family jewels slap the salami wank it wax the carrot wax the dolphin punch the clown self abuse cook up a batch crack one off frig pet ones kitty play with ones self drop the kids off at the pool beat the meat yank it fuck your hand or pudwhack however halfway through the playthough with my hand on my p3nis i started crying the story was simply so moving and emotional that i had to wipe both my tears and ejaculate at the same time the only issue i had with this game was no traps  in conclusion get the game if you want an amazing storyline and beautiful visuals or if you want to masturbate just get it    references neko works and 2020 nekopara creators at duckduckgo retrieved march 11 2020 from

"What can I say but wow. There is a small story as to why this game ended up on my account. You see, I would tend to help friends in various games to help them level, earn rewards, etc. They naturally asked if I wanted any compensation for my efforts. And I would always jokingly respond that the best form of payment is in Nekopara. This “joke” turned into what is now my complete devotion to the characters, world and 18+ patch when one of my friends actually went ahead and got one of the games for me. Now it is easy to explain why I love this series, and yes, a Lenny face is very fitting. This Visual Novel, which make no mistake, is all it is. Puts you in the shoes of a pastry, sweet and cake maker, etc. Who has recently moved out of home to set up a café business. However, upon unpacking his possession finds that two of the boxes contain two of his cat girls, who managed to stow themselves away so they could stay with him. What follows is a cute story of him coming to terms with them wanting to stick with him and the cat girls development as employees of the business…… and other “developments” if you catch my drift. Yes, these cats are not left untouched for very long, and it very quickly sheds it’s somewhat innocent image in exchange for what is the purest, sweetest vanilla fun times that you could ask to come across. Sure, the story has zero interaction, sure the animations aren’t crazy, sure some scenes stagnate when you are reading miles of text. But it just doesn’t matter. Because this is Nekopara. This is the epitome of cat girls. I will come back for the story once and for the real “plot” a hundred times more. I wear my Nekopara badges, wallpapers and achievements with pride. This review will forever be left here, as a sign of pride.

It's also nice to be able to pat them on the head and show affeciton to them.

"The only reason I recommend this game is because if your looking at this game your most likely doing one or more of 3 things: 1. Your a coomer, 2. Your a weeb who loves boring slice of life, 3. Your buying for a friend as a joke. And if those are your reasons for buying the game then you'll be happy with your purchase and you dont need to read the rest of this review. Now if your like me and and have certain views when it comes to games like this then buckle up because i'm about to rant.   I'm gonna start by saying that I like TNA as much as the next guy but the way this game works it in is kinda weird. The catgirls have some sort of mating thing where they are just horny which is super weird to me at least because the game portrays the catgirls as your children/pets. So imagine fucking your kid that's kinda fucked up to and that's exactly how it felt every time. In fact there's literally a scene after a sex scene where the dude says the cat girls are like his kids and lovers which as a sentence is fucked dude.   Now when it comes to the plot it could not get more boring (thats my own opinion not saying it's a fact) it's a classic slice of life with a shit ton of anime tropes that I personally do not enjoy. In a nutshell your watching cat girls be cute for 8 hours. This is classic example of the slice of life anime joke: Hey dude what happened in the new chapter? Bro nothing. Like I literally almost fell asleep at one point. But again this is my own opinion and if you like happy funny cute wholesome chungus reddit 100 moments then you'll have a field day with this game.  That's pretty much every aspect of the game and if you like sex and cute anime girls then boom you got yourself the perfect game. In my opinion though there's better things to spend $25 on.

"Only one story path with only one ending. There is a story but only in the most liberal definition of one. Getting through said story is a bit of a slog and that's saying something because it's not very long. The plot goes no where and honestly the central conflict in the story is resolved in the first hour the next three is just pointless nonsense and retreading similar ground as the first hour. Really not worth the money.   The graphics are above average for a visual novel mostly in the fact that it is animated and i guess the music suits the fluff atmosphere but nothing particularly groundbreaking here. When i say animated i'm not talking School Days animated, more Tokyo School Life Animated. I can't speak much on the voice acting because i don't speak a word of Japanese.

"Well...here it is...my review of NEKOPARA Vol. 1. Honestly I don't where to start this game and franchise has become the most addictive thing imaginable to me. However, I'll try to get through this anyway so here goes.  NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a visual novel game with the option of purchasable 18+ content, soundtracks, an artbook and the NEKOPARA OVA Set. The game is set in Japan in a fantasy world where creatures called ""catgirls"" exist. Catgirls are the combination of a human female and a feline, specifically their body is that of a human with the only exception being that they have cat ears, tails and their ears/tails are the same colour as their hair/fur. The main ""protagonist"" is a young guy called Kashou Minaduki. He has a younger sister named Shigure and they both own six catgirls. Those catgirls from eldest to youngest go: Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon and Coconut with the youngest of the catgirls being a pair of twin sisters named Chocola and Vanilla and during the time this game is set they are 9 months old in human years. The story in this volume starts off with Kashou moving from the Minaduki household to his own bakery to start his own business ""La Soleil"" as a patisserie. Chocola and Vanilla hear about the news and set out to get their master to let them stay with him. I won't spoil the rest of the game otherwise some people will complain and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who is thinking of buying it.   Now that the story has been dealt with, what do I think of the game? Well, if you couldn't already tell from my steam profile and steam inventory, I LOVE IT! The characters are animated using a software called E-mote, an advanced software that allows NEKOWORKs to animate the character's bodies. The story is wonderful and was good enough to make me buy volumes 2 and 3 to see the rest of the story and even buy NEKOPARA Extra and volume 0 to see the events before volume 1. If you're here for the 18+ content, you won't be disappointed I would say it's definitely worth it's price and I thoroughly enjoyed the game. The soundtracks to NEKOPARA Vol. 1 are incredible but to be honest the soundtracks are incredible throughout the NEKOPARA franchise. The Vol. 1 artbook is nice and comes in a PDF format in the game's files in the Steam directory. The NEKOPARA OVA Set, in my opinion, is worth the money as it provides you with the 210 page NEKOPARA Chronicles artbook (definitely worth the money just on it's own) and the soundtracks of the NEKOPARA OVA which are as stated earlier incredible (although I prefer the in-game music more than the OVA music I cannot complain).  Do you want catgirls? Do you want a good, gripping story that spans across five games (with Vol. 4 in production and Vol. 5 planned that would make it 7 games)? Do you want 18+ content that you can watch again if you want to at anytime? Do you want some nice theme songs and music to listen to? If you want all of these NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is worth it for you. Before you pay for the full game I recommend downloading the demo and playing that as it goes through the game to the intro video and stops there. Obviously it's up to you if you'd like to purchase specific DLC and leave out others but I'd definitely recommend all the DLC and especially that if you get the game, you get the 18+ content for it too.  If you would've told me one year ago I'd be not only playing this franchise but addicted to it to the point of purchasing figurines, snapback caps, soundtracks, artbooks, all the games, the OVA and OVA Extra, and a huge collection of steam items including the badges, the foil and non-foil trading cards, the backgrounds and the emoticons, then I'd say you're delusional. That was one year ago, here I am now making this review and not regretting getting into this franchise as much as I've done. It's brought so much happiness to me and I've even talked about it with my parents and they have accepted the fact that I play it even with 18+ content. If you want further information on the franchise it won't be difficult to find. This game will always be remembered as the start of an addiction that I love and I'm happy I started.  NEKOPARA isn't for everyone but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying it. If you're not too rushed about purchasing it then I'd wait till a Steam Sale and purchase it then, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks NEKOWORKs, Sayori, Sekai Project and anyone who has worked on the NEKOPARA franchise as a whole, I look forward to the Nekoparaiten mobile game, the rest of the TV anime series and NEKOPARA Vol. 4 and Vol. 5.  That's it for this review, sorry for making it so long but I kind of had to. It's the one thing that has made me happier ever since.",wellhere it ismy review of nekopara vol 1 honestly i dont where to start this game and franchise has  the most addictive thing imaginable to me however ill try to get through this anyway so here goes  nekopara vol 1 is a visual novel game with the option of purchasable 18 content soundtracks an artbook and the nekopara ova set the game is set in japan in a fantasy world where creatures called catgirls exist catgirls are  of a human female and a feline specifically their body is that of a human with the only exception being that they have cat ears tails and their earstails are the same colour as their hairfur the main protagonist is a young guy called kashou minaduki he has a younger sister named shigure and they both own six catgirls those catgirls from eldest to youngest go azuki maple cinnamon and coconut with the youngest of the catgirls being a pair of twin sisters named chocola and vanilla and during the time this game is set they are 9 months old in human years the story in this volume starts off with kashou moving from the minaduki household to his own bakery to start his own business la soleil as a patisserie chocola and vanilla hear about the news and set out to get their master to let them stay with him i wont spoil the rest of the game otherwise some people  and i dont want to ruin it for anyone who is thinking of buying it   now that the story has been dealt with what do i think of the game well if you couldnt already tell from my steam profile and steam inventory i love it the characters are animated using a software called emote an advanced software that allows nekoworks to animate the characters bodies the story is wonderful and was good enough to make me buy volumes 2 and 3 to see the rest of the story and even buy nekopara extra and volume 0 to see the events before volume 1 if youre here for the 18 content you wont be disappointed i would say its definitely worth its price and i thoroughly enjoyed the game the soundtracks to nekopara vol 1 are incredible but to be honest the soundtracks are incredible throughout the nekopara franchise the vol 1 artbook is nice  in a pdf format in the games files in the steam directory the nekopara ova set in my opinion is worth the money as it provides you with the 210 page nekopara chronicles artbook definitely worth the money just on its own and the soundtracks of the nekopara ova which are as stated earlier incredible although i prefer the ingame music more than the ova music i   do you want catgirls do you want a good gripping story that spans across five games with vol 4 in production and vol 5 planned that would make it 7 games do you want 18 content that you can watch again if you want to at anytime do you want some nice theme songs and music to listen to if you want all of these nekopara vol 1 is worth it for you before you pay for the full game i  downloading the demo and playing that as it goes through the game to the intro video and stops there obviously its up to you if youd like to purchase specific dlc and leave out others but id definitely  all the dlc and especially that if you get the game you get the 18 content for it too  if you wouldve told me one year ago id be not only playing this franchise but addicted to it to the point of purchasing figurines snapback caps soundtracks artbooks all the games the ova and ova extra and a huge collection of steam items including the badges the foil and nonfoil trading cards the backgrounds and the emoticons then id say youre delusional that was one year ago here i am now making this review and not regretting getting into this franchise as much as ive done its brought so much happiness to me and ive even talked about it with my parents and they have accepted the fact that i play it even with 18 content if you want further information on the franchise it wont be difficult to find this game will always be remembered as the start of an addiction that i love and im happy i started  nekopara isnt for everyone but id definitely  it to anyone who is interested in buying it if youre not too rushed about purchasing it then id wait till a steam sale and purchase it then you wont be disappointed  thanks nekoworks sayori sekai project and anyone who has worked on the nekopara franchise as a whole i look forward to the nekoparaiten mobile game the rest of the tv anime series and nekopara vol 4 and vol 5  thats it for this review sorry for making it so long but i kind of had to its the one thing that has made me happier ever since,POS,0.9513744115829468

"Who would have thought that the weirdest thing in a game about catgirls is actually your little sister, who is 100% human? Me neither, but it happened.  In all fairness, the dialogue was at times truly hilarious - I found myself laughing at my pc a couple of times whereas this game is clearly not (primarily) meant for that, but it really got me at times with Vanilla's witty remarks. There's also quite a bit of cheesy talk near the end which I was a bit less of a fan of, but nothing that really broke the experience for me.   Truth be told, I did look up the uncensor patch, but it would seem that it did not work after I installed it - I actually feel like that was not such a bad thing in the end. Most of the experience for me now was just a light-hearted, genuinly funny visual novel with clear attention to detail, from their facial expressions (which only very rarely ventured into the uncanny valley) to their motions (yes, there is a 'chest bounciness' slider in the menu which I kept at about half, which seemed fine), to the voice acting, which was pretty well done in my opinion (despite every other sentence ending with a meow, but you get desensitised pretty quickly).   Now, to address the elephant in the room, is it worth the full price? I would have to say 'no' unfortunately, for the gameplay is literally non-existent to the point that if you would check 'auto' and leave, your computer would play the whole game for you to the end in about 6 hours. I got it in a -50% sale and I think that then it is about worth it, if you can appreciate these kind of things, that is.  Long story short, I would actually recommend to 'play' this game exactly how it is on steam, for it offers a nice feel-good story with cute characters that makes you forget about the world around you, but just not enough to prevent you from looking over you shoulder periodically, because... you know, just in case. Even though it is all pretty harmless in the end. If you are looking for a very deep story, this is not the place to look, but you already knew that from the start. If you are looking for something very erotic, I would just recommend opening an incognito tab in google and go have fun that way. If you just want to enjoy a couple of relaxing evenings, consider giving it a go. Who knows, maybe you'll like it.  One concluding remark: I don't think playing this game or any related stuff is something to be ashamed of. You were probably expecting me to say something like 'this game was gifted to me ;_;' or 'I was forced to play this lol', but you know what? I bought this game for myself because it seemed fun. There. I said it. And in the end, it was indeed fun, I laughed and the girls were cute - I have no regrets. No regrets at all.  So, that was all I had to say, sitting behind my pc at 3 AM (yes, I know I'm not living up to my statements in previous paragraph, but at least I didn't set my status to offline, which I know you will). And after all this only one question remains: why did I go through the effort of seriously reviewing this game in the first place? Perhaps some questions are better left unanswered.",who would have thought that the weirdest thing in a game about catgirls is actually your little sister who is 100 human me neither but it happened  in all fairness the dialogue was at times truly hilarious  i found myself laughing at my pc a couple of times whereas this game is clearly not primarily meant for that but it really got me at times with vanillas witty remarks theres also quite a bit of cheesy talk near the end which i was a bit less of a fan of but nothing that really broke the experience for me   truth be told i did look up the uncensor patch but it would seem that it did not work after i installed it  i actually feel like that was not such a bad thing in the end most of the experience for me now was just a lighthearted genuinly funny visual novel with clear attention to detail from their facial expressions which only very rarely ventured into the uncanny valley to their motions yes there is a chest bounciness slider in the menu which i kept at about half which seemed fine to the voice acting which was pretty well done in my opinion despite every other sentence ending with a meow but you get desensitised pretty quickly   now to address the elephant in the room is it worth the full price i would have to say no unfortunately for the gameplay is literally nonexistent to the point that if you would check auto and leave  would play the whole game for you to the end in about 6 hours i got it in a 50 sale and i think that then it is about worth it if you can appreciate these kind of things that is  long story short i would actually  to play this game exactly how it is on steam for it offers a nice feelgood story with cute characters that makes you forget about the world around you but just not enough to prevent you from looking over you shoulder periodically because you know just in case even though it is all pretty harmless in the end if you are looking for a very deep story this is not the place to look but you already knew that from the start if you are looking for something very erotic i would just  opening an incognito tab in google and go have fun that way if you just want to enjoy a couple of relaxing evenings consider giving it a go who knows maybe youll like it  one concluding remark i dont think playing this game or any related stuff is something to be ashamed of you were probably expecting me to say something like this game was gifted to me _ or i was forced to play this lol but you know what i bought this game for myself because it seemed fun there i said it and in the end it was indeed fun i laughed and the girls were cute  i have no regrets no regrets at all  so that was all i had to say sitting behind my pc at 3 am yes i know im not living up to my statements in previous paragraph but at least i didnt set my status to offline which i know you will and after all this only one question remains why did i go through the effort of seriously reviewing this game in the first place perhaps some questions are better left unanswered,NEU,0.6051865220069885

"Personal Rating \\ 10/10   This game is a masterfully crafted first-person shooter with the charm of Titanfall 2 and the fast-paced, shoot to kill feel of Call of Duty. I couldn't recommend this game more to my friends. I've spent dozens of hours playing this game and its many, many modes.  Search and Destroy has to be my favorite, especially since the characters, such as Coconut and Vanilla, don't impact gameplay as much as they do in the TDM mode. Each character has their quirks and bugs but in all honesty, none of them are gamebreaking. I do believe however that the developers made a good decision in allowing a photography mode into the singleplayer campaign.  On the note of campaign. Every second of it is an artistic masterpiece and the player is (or should be) always engaged in the character design and how the characters constantly stay interesting throughout the complete story. The plot never feels too confusing or stereotypical. Controls are extremely fluid and have a massive amount of customizability. You never feel too weak or too strong, and you never feel like there's no way to make an impact, even from moment one. There are plenty of available weapons and even more you can unlock. Many of them are cosmetic, but others are unique weapons with many easter eggs. No spoilers :)  Honestly, if I had to play only one game for the rest of my life, it'd have to be Nekopara, any of them in the series.

"Not too long. Part 1 and 2 are like 5 hours. And part 3 is like 7 hours. But the whole series is very cute and fun. Superb voice acting. Gorgeous animated CGs with idle breathing animations, moving mouths, emoting and other things like that. So really high production value. Virtually no bugs. I had 2 or 3 occasions, where the text would not fit the voice, but nothing serious. Every character has a little arc to it, which makes it a joy to read. And there are also some emotional moments for each character and a satisfying ""end"" for every one. This alone would make it a really good VN. But then there's all the lewd scenes, if you decided to buy the 18+ DLCs. Those ramp up the quality to 11. They are animated in something that looks like 2.5D, relatively long and good finishes. You get a couple of thoose per character. So that's basically the cherry on the pie.  You can totally ebjoy the all-ages version. But I think, the 18+ stuff is also worth it's money.  So overall, a really great, really cute, really fun VN series.",not too long part 1 and 2 are like 5 hours and part 3 is like 7 hours but the whole series is very cute and fun superb voice acting gorgeous animated cgs with idle breathing animations moving mouths emoting and other things like that so really high production value virtually no bugs i had 2 or 3 occasions where the text would not fit the voice but nothing serious every character has a little arc to it which makes it a joy to read and there are also some emotional moments for each character and a satisfying end for every one this alone would make it a really good vn but then theres all the lewd scenes if you decided to buy the 18 dlcs those ramp up the quality to 11 they are animated in something that looks like 25d relatively long and good finishes you get a couple of thoose per character so thats basically the cherry on the pie  you can totally ebjoy the allages version but i think the 18 stuff is also worth its money  so overall a really great really cute really fun vn series,POS,0.978361189365387

"Ewan McGregor really helped sell the emotion of the movie, acting phenomenally considering that a majority of his co-stars were CGI stuffed animals. As the movie progresses, his character becomes less and less serious and more playful, and McGregor pulls this transition off phenomenally, being both funny and believable. Many actors, specifically comedy actors, would have overdone this transition, making their funny moments over the top just to get a laugh. McGregor still managed to get a laugh, humorously yet believably becoming more like Pooh as the movie progressed in a natural, yet still entertaining manner.  While the return of all of the animal characters was fantastic, Pooh truly stood out as the star of the show. Eeyore's self loathing, Piglet's anxiety, and Tigger's pride with his uniqueness certainly added their own factors to the mix, but Pooh still stood out. This movie reminded audiences of why Winnie the Pooh was such a great character to begin with: he represents everything good in this world. He teaches us to appreciate the little things and to take the time to appreciate what you have.   The genius part of Christopher Robin is that, when the movie actually started, Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh were polar opposites. This was an incredibly clever way to start the story, as in all of the previous Winnie the Pooh stories, Christopher Robin and Pooh were almost always on the same page. This change to Christopher Robin's character added a new twist to the movie that would certainly be relatable for any adults who watched Winnie the Pooh as a kid. This entire piece of character development was a clever writing twist that certainly helped to keep the movie incredibly interesting.  Another factor that kept the movie interesting and visually entertaining was the color scheme. While the trailers showed that it would have a desaturated look, the finished product itself had a gorgeous red tint to it. It made the sunset scenes in Hundred Acre Wood absolutely beautiful, turning the classic scenes from the cartoons and books into an even more gorgeous piece of imagery.  All things considered, the latest live-action movie from Walt Disney Pictures is a truly heartwarming experience that any Disney fan is sure to enjoy. The return of the classic characters, and the in-depth development from Christopher Robin, portrayed by Ewan McGregor, made the movie enjoyable and touching. Though it may not bring in the big bucks like Beauty and the Beast did, Christopher Robin is still a great success from Disney and stands out from the rest of their live-action movies.",ewan mcgregor really helped sell the emotion of the movie acting phenomenally considering that a majority of his costars were cgi stuffed animals as the movie progresses his character  less and less serious and more playful and mcgregor pulls this transition off phenomenally being both funny and believable many actors  actors would have overdone this transition making their funny moments over the top just to get a laugh mcgregor still managed to get a laugh humorously yet believably  more like pooh as the movie progressed in a natural yet still entertaining manner  while the return of all of the animal characters was fantastic pooh truly stood out as the star of the show eeyores self loathing piglets anxiety and tiggers pride with his uniqueness certainly added their own factors to the mix but pooh still stood out this movie reminded audiences of why winnie the pooh was such a great character to begin with he represents everything good in this world he teaches us to appreciate the little things and to take the time to appreciate what you have   the genius part of christopher robin is that when the movie actually started christopher robin and winnie the pooh were polar opposites this was an incredibly clever way to start the story as in all of the previous winnie the pooh stories christopher robin and pooh were almost always on the same page this change to christopher robins character added a new twist to the movie that would certainly be relatable for any adults who watched winnie the pooh as a kid this entire piece of character development was a clever writing twist that certainly helped to keep the movie incredibly interesting  another factor that kept the movie interesting and visually entertaining was the color scheme while the trailers showed that it would have a desaturated look the finished product itself had a gorgeous red tint to it it made the sunset scenes in hundred acre wood absolutely beautiful turning the classic scenes from the cartoons and books into an even more gorgeous piece of imagery  all things considered the latest liveaction movie from walt disney pictures is a truly heartwarming experience that any disney fan is sure to enjoy the return of the classic characters and the indepth development from christopher robin portrayed by ewan mcgregor made the movie enjoyable and touching though it may not bring in the big bucks like beauty and the beast did christopher robin is still a great success from disney and stands out from the rest of their liveaction movies,POS,0.87238609790802

"Distilled catgirl cuteness!  PROS: This is a rather basic kinetic visual novel, but it plays to it's strength.  The story is coherent and straightforward, and though no end goal is given through the novel, it's the kind of story that doesn't need one.  It's fluff, cutesy and adorable with some emotional substance provided for the characters.  The art is fairly standard, as is the soundtrack, but I did enjoy the main theme, 'Taiyou Paradise.'  CONS: It is a rather basic kinetic visual novel, so the lack of choices may turn a few people off.  Having to pay extra for any sort of H-material seems to be grasping for a bit of extra cash, and feels a little odd.  A key bother, though, is the moving characters during the novel.  The way they dart about has an uncanny valley effect, and just comes off a bit stiff and unnatural at times.  The addition of a 'bounce' feature feels equally confusing.  ACHIEVEMENTS: Another visual novel that really only requires story progression.  Thanks to the style, most will be unlocked with one pass, though a quick start with the languages to round it off.  FINAL: This was a rather adorable experience that one can find enjoyment in, H-scenes or SFW.  It does feel like just adorable fluff in VN form, but it's the type of quick break that was enjoyed over the period of time played, and does leave a positive feeling for the later games to hopefully continue the story in the same charming, adorable light.",distilled catgirl cuteness  pros this is a rather basic  visual novel but it plays to its strength  the story is coherent and straightforward and though no end goal is given through the novel its the kind of story that doesnt need one  its fluff cutesy and adorable with some emotional substance provided for the characters  the art is fairly standard as is the soundtrack but i did enjoy the main theme taiyou paradise  cons it is a rather basic  visual novel so the lack of choices may turn a few people off  having to pay extra for any sort of hmaterial seems to be grasping for a bit of extra cash and feels a little odd  a key bother though is the moving characters during the novel  the way they dart about has an uncanny valley effect and  off a bit stiff and unnatural at times  the addition of a bounce feature feels equally confusing  achievements another visual novel that really only requires story progression  thanks to the style most will be unlocked with one pass though a quick start with the languages to round it off  final this was a rather adorable experience that one can find enjoyment in hscenes or sfw  it does feel like just adorable fluff in vn form but its the type of quick break that was enjoyed over the period of time played and does leave a positive feeling for the later games to hopefully continue the story in the same charming adorable light,NEU,0.5143942832946777

"After a year and a half and at least four readings, I think it's finally time I reviewed NEKOPARA. While the thousands of meme reviews are indeed quite funny, I figured it would be best for me to put in some serious effort. So then, let me share with you why this series, particularly this first volume, resonates so well with me.  Where do I start? Well, if you've taken a peek at some screenshots, you'll likely come to some easy conclusions. You may think the CGs are plentiful and varied, the backgrounds are high quality, and the sprites are incredibly detailed. Indeed, you'd be right, except for the last bit. You see, NEKOPARA isn't content with mere sprites that you'd see with most other visual novels. Instead, you'll notice that characters are in fact rendered in 3D, but still look very anime-esque. At least, that's the best way for me to describe them. Characters are in constant animation, often moving around in the screen space, with fluid facial expressions provided by the ""e-mote"" system. If you believe that VNs are too formulaic-looking, NEKOPARA will be a pleasant surprise.  In addition to glorious visual prowess, NEKOPARA also features complimentary sounds. There's a healthy amount of music, and each track does a good job of setting the tone of each moment. The opening theme never fails to get me dancing! Sound effects are numerous as well, and coupled with the visual movements, I find that they do a good job of eliminating the need of many awkward and drawn out descriptions that other VNs might require (though some of them are...well, you'll know when you hear them). As for the voice acting, I don't have any complaints really. I love how even though it's all in Japanese, you'll often hear English words and phrases thrown in nonchalantly. It's charming, really. Everything works together to be a joy for the senses.  As for the story, I'm not exactly sure what I expected. You've likely seen the memes already, and they're undoubtedly part of the drive behind the series' success. That said, NEKOPARA offers more than one might expect at first. At its core, the story is a slice of life with catgirls, which leads to some interesting moments, to say the least. It's about Kashou Minaduki, an aspiring baker who leaves his home and family business to open his own store. He's accompanied by two of his family's (more specifically, his sister Shigure's) catgirls, the carefree and oblivious Chocola, and the cheeky and intelligent Vanilla. These three learn to become an eccentric family-like unit together, all while learning to manage the new store. Overall, there are plenty of humorous and lighthearted moments. Even after several readings, they still manage to get some hefty laughs out of me. Chocola and Vanilla each have their quirks as catgirls, and I think the best moments are when they interact as a duo and show them off. Kashou himself his a bit dense, but I do like him in general. Occasionally though, things can get serious, and a couple times I managed to let a few tears loose. It's silly to think that such a story could pull that off, but maybe it's that very surprise that got to me the most. I won't spoil the ending chapter, but man, that did a number on me! Overall, I found the writing to be very solid, and no doubt much of this is thanks to a great localization. I won't try and proclaim that this volume is literary high art, but it understands exactly what it wants to do and does it very effectively.  Alright, I've managed to avoid it thus far, but it's about time we talk about the naughty bits. Yeah, the very basis of most of the memes. My first reading without the lewd patch was about five hours long. Later on when I finally did install it, I think it was roughly one hour of additional content. There's three scenes in all, and wow do they get intense. This is when the animations go into overdrive, and you may find out that your PC isn't quite up to snuff for them. In fact, if you notice the opening cinematic getting out of sync with the theme, I would recommend turning off those animations. Also, my goodness, those sounds effects are strange. As to the question of if you need the patch, well, it's your call. If you really don't want to participate in that stuff, don't feel pressured to, because it's not necessary to enjoy everything else. But if you're a connoisseur of such content, expect quality. There's a reason everyone talks about it...  I've praised this volume quite a bit already, but I guess I should address some nitpicks. Even though she has some good moments, I don't care much for Shigure. She's just crazy at times. Also, the scene in which all six Minaduki catgirls are present feels a bit crowded, and you don't get to much of a sense of the others until later on. Finally, while I was alright with it, I can imagine some readers may be put off by the intense voice acting, so I could understand if you feel the need to hush or completely mute it. Ultimately though, these are minor complaints, and this is all I could really think of to mention.  Now that I've said all I need to, I can fully recommend NEKOPARA vol. 1 to anyone who might be interested. If you're a veteran of visual novels, it's practically required reading. This was actually one of my first VN experiences, and it absolutely got me interested in the genre as a whole. Fair warning though, it may not be fair to expect other VNs to measure up to this series, because it's just that unique and great. While many of the reviews are humorous and not particularly informative, the overwhelmingly positive status they give does not lie. Unless you're highly averse to these offerings for whatever reason, I can't recommend NEKOPARA enough!",after a year and a half and at least four readings i think its finally time i reviewed nekopara

"i had a lot of fun with the fast paced fps aspect of this game. in the sense that you can actually feel what the other player is doing at any given moment. it really gives you a feeling that you're literally connected to everyone but at the same time competing for the most strength and getting the most powerful weapons.  i'd say the tutorial needs a bit of a rework, because when you spawn in for the first time it's always incredibly overwhelming. that happens mostly because anyone can feel anyone's strength at any given moment. in fact this game does have a chat feature but it's not even necessary. you can mostly tell the message of anyone by just looking in their eyes. you can feel what every other player does, has, needs and feels at any given moment. you can react to feeling someone's something any way you want, but one thing is for sure, everyone else will know what you felt in response to that other person's feeling. and it just leads to an endless mindfuck domino of intimate subconscious messages that could not be expressed in a linguistic language   the voice chat experience is absolutely out of this fucking world. you have to hold both ctrl and a to enable speech, thank fuck i changed that in the controls menu. but eitherway that's besides the point. what i'm trying to say is that because this game feels so intimate, talking to other players is an almost sexual experience.  all npc's in this game play more of a guiding role in this game. for example  chocola shows you how to greedily feel everything to the brim vanilla shows you a place to rest when you feel you've felt enough coconut does something related to your kpu settings idfk something like that  i swear to god one time the chocola npc was unavailable, so, with nowhere to access her ""shops"", some dude asked me for 3 sticks and 1 iron bar and the moment i said ""yes"" i felt his fucking heart skip a beat, then mine skipped two, and we were eventually in sync. that very moment i swear i turned gay. i turned gay. this fucking game turned me gay.  the most interesting part is that all emotions seem to balance out because of the way all emotions seem to connect and blend into a warm liquid in which everyone can experience everything at the same time.  it doesn't matter what race, height, weight, nationality ... or hell even what gender you are. this game teaches you how to feel love. it connects us as human beings, it throws the harsh laws of evolution out the window. sex doesn't even feel intimate anymore. competition never induces jealousy or feelings of lonliness, it only teases you into oblivion.  the interesting part is that if you start to love a player in this game you can't hide it for a microsecond, because they would immediately feel you, and they would immediately respond back with something (again, subconsciously) and you will respond back with something else and something else and someone else and if they don't reject you then welcome to unicorn world but else you will just get over it and just go look for someone else and immediately fall in love again ^ all of this happens in aprox 0.028 seconds  you can't really feel much pain from the rejection because everything happens way too quickly for your brain to be able to comprehend the negative emotions. that is because negative emotions take thought, but positive ones don't have to  this is what god wanted from us, this is what god was trying to teach us all along by putting us on this world. teaching us that in fact nothing matters, teaching us that suffering (even in the slightest) is not something you just ""deal"" with, it's something tied to evolution and survival, and when that dies out thanks to technology slowly we still feel it but slowly we instead start to indulge ourselves in it to the point where we are not even anything alive anymore and we just exist as something beyond comprehension  con: a bug i found with using nvidia 3040 gpu sometimes your vision turns black when in a watery place",i had a lot of fun with the fast paced fps aspect of this game in the sense that you can actually feel what the other player is doing at any given moment it really gives you a feeling that youre literally connected to everyone but at the same  for the most strength and getting the most powerful weapons  id say the tutorial needs a bit of a rework because when you spawn in for the first time its always incredibly overwhelming that happens mostly because anyone can feel anyones strength at any given moment in fact this game does have a chat feature but its not even necessary you can mostly tell the message of anyone by just looking in their eyes you can feel what every other player does has needs and feels at any given moment you can react to feeling someones something any way you want but one thing is for sure everyone else will know what you felt in response to that other persons feeling and it just leads to an endless mindfuck domino of

"I got this after hearing about it online. First, yes, it's ultimately *that* kind of game, so expect that kind of thing in here.  But what makes this worth the price to me - when I could easily find free stuff online - are the sheer depth of the characters. Chocola and Vanilla are absolutely *charming* in their portrayal, emphasized by the skill their respective actresses bring, and they both work wonderfully as natural compliments to each other, each of them making up for the other.  The story is also very charming in itself. Though it is a typical ""harem""-style story with an inevitable conclusion, the writing helps bring it to life; Chocola confessing her sadness early on actually tore at me, and Vanilla's mischievous streak had me cackling at times. In this case, it is the journey itself that counts more then the destination, and the journey was enjoyable all the way through!  The supporting cast are also quite good, though a bit lacking in depth currently. Still, I know there's more volumes out there, so I'm sure they'll all get their own screen time.  My one complaint: the graphics are a bit...stiff. It sucks that only one character can seem to move at a time, which makes for some initially confusing moments. Fortunately, the writing is good enough that the confusion goes away quickly after moving to the next couple of sections, but it did detract a bit at times. There also seem to be a few glitches with the speech where you sometimes have to click twice to make the full text appear (a problem if you're not a natural Japanese speaker, as VO is only in Japanese).  Still, none of this was nearly enough to detract from my enjoyment, and I'm looking forward to trying the other volumes in Neokpara soon!  ...Oh, and for those who are new to Graphic Novels: this isn't really a ""game"", as there's no interactivity beyond what you might get out of an actual book (click to move on to the next sequence, bookmark your spot for later, etc). No mini-games or puzzles or other stuff like that.

For anyone who doesn't know, this ""game"" it's not exactly that, you don't have any kind of power over the characters you are watching, since visual novels only focuses on showing you a story, kinda like a book or a novel, but they give you soundtrack, scenarios, character design and voice acting, so you won't have a lot of fun unless you really like the story behinf it.

This makes Final Fantasy 15 look like Cat shit with its top of the line 4k graphics or should i say furr-k. I personally believe that you all should play this with your children in your room and your wives because you have to be a Chad to know what is up enough to buy this game. My Aigis Toaster left me and took the kids. This is nothing but worth your time as a alpha creature of society. My friends that I have think im really cool for owning this game series. Undertales story has nothing on this. There should be more catfights though, so in the end I give this socially accepted masterpiece a 9/10, not enough catfights. also RoboFortune didnt make a cameo so there were no robot catgirls, they missed out on a golden oppertunity, the nude patch while I do not own is highly suggested, because you get to see your favourite characters in their full glory. The music for the game is a masterpiece of orchestral art, I came into this right after playing persona 3 and I did not hear the word baby once in song lyrics which is very good. My dick is raw and looks like a dogs, my balls are blue and its all thanks to you. i wonder if chocola would love a jew, prolly not tho, theyre really ew. vanilla is the best character ive ever seen the character development on her was mwa, si magnifique.

"Okay, I think it's time for some real talk: It was mentioned in the story that Chocola and Vanilla are only 9 months old, and they are about 12~ years old in human age.

These catgirls' military value is astonishing. They turn from an infant into a well developed human being who is completely capable of speech in mere 12 months. Not only that, but judging from this quick growth I can guess that even their reproduction rate is similar to felines, so before getting sent to the frontlines they can even produce a couple of offsprings, who can get trained and sent out the following year aswell, only growing in numbers.

With the creative boss battles and innovative style it was well worth replaying over and over despite the naysayers who complain about its length. After all, the same thing can be said for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty with its incessant Codec conversations and movies. Strip away MGS2's story and there's a pretty short game there as well. As for its story itself there's little of interest unless you really want to spend a couple of late, smoky nights going over the details and putting all the pieces together, and they do fit together. While that's kind of interesting if you want a pleasant mind rutting, it was far from fun to watch a game eat itself.  Still, the one thing that MGS2 did right, fantastically right, was take the gold standard of stealth espionage action from MGS and update it beautifully for the current generation. The graphics were amazing to look at and with the new sets of moves and details to dig into, gamers kept going back again and again for more to try out a situation in a different way or collect all of the dog tags they could get.

You must resist these freaks as they advance on you as much as possible, failure to do so will result in the bad ending where our hero Cashew ends up mesmerized by the evil Chocola and Vanilla, who have their way with him. If you think you have the skills to get to the good ending, and appreciate a game where almost every choice results in faliure, then by all means give it a go.

"Dota 2 — компьютерная многопользовательская командная игра в жанре multiplayer online battle arena, разработанная Valve Corporation. Является независимым продолжением карты-модификации DotA для игры Warcraft III. Dota 2 работает по модели free-to-play с элементами микроплатежей.  Разработка игры началась в 2009 году, когда компания Valve приняла на работу основного разработчика DotA — IceFrog, а летом 2010 года подала заявку на регистрацию этой торговой марки. 13 октября 2010 года на игровом портале Game Informer игра была анонсирована к выходу в 2011 году. 15 августа 2011 года в официальном блоге был опубликован трейлер к игре. Dota 2 вышла в июле 2013 года после того, как два года находилась в стадии бета-тестирования.  Изначально Dota 2 была выпущена на игровом движке Source, после чего в 2015 году была портирована на Source 2, став первой работающей на нём игрой. В Dota 2 предусмотрена возможность создавать пользовательские режимы игры, оформление карты и косметические предметы для героев, после чего добавить их в Dota 2 при помощи Steam Workshop. Dota 2 является одной из наиболее популярных игр в Steam и получила в целом положительные отзывы критиков за игровой процесс, качество производства и сохранение положительных сторон своей предшественницы. Среди основных недостатков игры была отмечена сложность обучения.  В игре принимают участие две команды по пять человек, каждая из которых имеет собственную базу на карте. Все игроки управляют одним из героев, обладающих уникальными способностями и различными стилями игры. Побеждает команда, разрушившая главное здание противника (англ. Ancient).  Dota 2 является активной киберспортивной дисциплиной, в которой профессиональные команды со всего мира соревнуются в различных лигах и турнирах. Премиум-турниры по Dota 2 имеют призовые фонды в миллионы долларов, не раз становившиеся крупнейшими в истории киберспорта. Самый крупный турнир по игре — The International, ежегодно проводимый Valve на стадионе Ки-арена в Сиэтле. Каждый сезон Valve также организует The Major. Крупные профессиональные турниры по Dota 2 транслируются на видеостриминговых сервисах, иногда набирая свыше миллиона зрителей одновременно. Людей, играющих в Dota 2, часто называют «дотерами». В игре участвуют две команды по пять человек. Одна команда играет за светлую сторону (англ. The Radiant), другая — за тёмную (англ. The Dire). Каждый игрок управляет одним персонажем, который называется героем. Герой может получать опыт для повышения своего уровня, зарабатывать золото, покупать и собирать предметы, которые усиливают его или дают дополнительные способности. Каждый игрок постоянно получает небольшое количество золота от своей базы, а также зарабатывает небольшие порции золота за убийство вражеских существ и большие — за убийство героев. Команды рассредотачиваются по линиям, на которых происходит борьба с вражескими героями и отрядами крипов (англ. creeps) под управлением компьютера, которые каждые полминуты появляются на базах команд. Цель игры — уничтожить главное здание на вражеской базе. Разработчики игры внесли ряд нововведений и улучшений в игровой процесс по сравнению с оригинальной игрой:  Поддержка переподключения (если случился разрыв соединения, можно вернуться в течение 5 минут, если это не сделано — игрок получает низкий приоритет поиска игры). Возможность поставить паузу в игре нажатием одной кнопки. Встроенный голосовой чат. В игре существует разделение игроков по территориальным зонам (в данный момент их четырнадцать: западная и восточная Европа, восток и запад США, Южная Америка, Россия, Индия, Южная Корея, Юго-Восточная Азия, Австралия, Чили, Перу, Дубай и Южная Африка), но при желании игроки могут играть в любой из этих зон. Проблема с задержками и лагами решена сведением к минимуму задержки между серверами и оптимизацией сетевого кода. Красочное, чистое и понятное визуальное представление действий. Доступны компьютерные боты с настраиваемой моделью поведения в виде сложности, которые могут играть вместе и/или против игроков; Продвинутая система повторов, присутствуют как обычные возможности, в виде перемотки и камеры от разных персонажей, так и возможность закладок, просмотр графиков, коллективный просмотр и многое другое. Также повторы будут храниться в Steam Cloud, что позволит игрокам не беспокоиться о потере повторов и о переносе их между разными компьютерами. Возможность присоединиться к любой незакрытой игре в качестве зрителя. Возможность быстро и легко настроить горячие клавиши. Наличие обучающих заданий, которые объясняют новичкам основы игры. Возможность просмотра информации о нанесённом уроне убитому игроку. История серии игр Dota началась в 2003 году с Defense of the Ancients (DotA) — пользовательской модификации для игры Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, созданной разработчиком с псевдонимом Eul. Дополнение для Warcraft III под названием The Frozen Throne было выпущено позже в том же году. Модификации серии Defense of the Ancients для нового дополнения соревновались в популярности. Наибольший успех имела DotA: Allstars, разработанная Стивом Фиком с псевдонимом Guinsoo, и Фик совместно с его другом Стивом Месконом создали официальный сайт сообщества Defense of the Ancients, а также компанию DotA-Allstars, LLC. Когда Фик в 2005 году прекратил работу над DotA: Allstars, его друг с псевдонимом IceFrog стал геймдизайнером игры. Популярность Defense of the Ancients значительно возросла, модификация была одной из самых общеизвестных в мире, а к 2008 году стала киберспортивной дисциплиной. В мае 2009 года в результате ссоры с Месконом IceFrog открыл новый сайт сообщества по адресу playdota.com.  Интерес Valve к обладанию Defense of the Ancients начался, когда несколько опытных сотрудников компании, включая дизайнера Team Fortress Робина Волкера, стали поклонниками модификации и активно в неё играли. Valve связалась с IceFrog по электронной почте с намерением узнать о его дальнейших планах по поводу игры, и впоследствии наняла его для руководства над разработкой продолжения DotA. IceFrog впервые объявил об этом в октябре 2009 года в своём блоге. Dota 2 была анонсирована на Game Informer в октябре 2010 года. Объявление о предстоящем выходе привело к резкому подъёму интереса к игре и вызвало перегрузку и отказ серверов Game Informer.  Название «Dota» было заимствовано Valve из акронима оригинальной модификации как наименование недавно приобретённой франшизы. Сотрудник компании Эрик Джонсон утверждал, что название обозначает понятие игры, так как используется в повседневной речи, и не является акронимом. Вскоре после анонса Dota 2 Valve подала заявку на товарный знак с названием Dota. В 2011 году на Gamescom глава компании Гейб Ньюэлл прокомментировал это, пояснив, что товарный знак был необходим для разработки продолжения с уже легко узнаваемым названием. Сделав название Dota общественным достоянием, Фик и Мескон зарегистрировали противостоящий товарный знак «DOTA» от имени DotA-Allstars, LLC, впоследствии ставшей дочерней компанией Riot Games с августа 2010 года. Вице-президент Blizzard Entertainment Роб Пардо сходным образом заявил, что название DotA принадлежало сообществу игроков модификации. Blizzard приобрела DotA-Allstars, LLC от Riot Games и в ноябре 2011 года подала возражения против Valve, ссылаясь на право собственности Blizzard как на Warcraft III World Editor, так и на DotA-Allstars, LLC, в качестве достаточного основания для претензий на владение всей франшизой. Конфликт был разрешён в мае 2012 года; права на коммерческое использование товарного знака «Dota» было сохранено за Valve, при этом было разрешено некоммерческое использование названия третьими лицами.  Ранней целью команды разработчиков Dota 2 была адаптация художественного стиля Defense of the Ancients к игровому движку Source. Названия сторон — «Стражи» (англ. «The Sentinel») и «Плеть» (англ. «The Scourge») — были заменены на светлую (англ. «The Radiant»)",dota 2  компьютерная многопользовательская командная игра в жанре

"I don't know why this game is labelled as ""Story Rich"". There is no story at all. Just a guy who lives with catgirls going through his daily life. The characters are simple and bland and the catgirls are not very amusing. Though I haven't finished the game yet, I'm pretty convinced that things won't be getting any better in the later chapters.   Not worth the money, nor the time. It only has nice visuals; some sort of album version would have been more fitting than turning this into a ""Visual Novel"". And it did have japanese voice-acting, but they weren't particularly amazing and fit the annoying characters well.   The music was a bit loud and a little repetetive and obnoxious.   Edit: I finished this Kinetic Novel (there's no choices to make, so it's not a visual novel), and it's more boring and even less meaningful than a lame slice-of-life anime can get.  The only character in the Kinetic Novel who was somewhat likeable was the main character's sister, who had romantic feelings towards him (though she wasn't forceful and the main character brushed the occaisional weird comments as jokes).

"Okay this is a honest review of Nekopara Vol.1 and the observations i made playing this Japanese ""masterpiece"". To start off, i thorougly cringed and laughed playing this game, specially from chapter 4 onwards, now, i definetely don't recommend buying this game (i didn't personally) if you have any of the following things : Ethics, a life, a will to live. Let's start with the key components about Nekofuckingpara [b] OUR MAIN LEAD (harem protagonist) [/b] ご主人[master]-sama as refered to by his slaves or "" Kashou "" by normal people standards, this dude is an outright pedophiliac and zoophiliac to every extent. Now i'm going to be honest here, this dude being out in society is a danger for everyone, he doesn't only at first bang his SLAVES, yes, his SLAVES; because he is the OWNER of the two humanoid catgirl sex dolls ; he first bangs them for 'HEALTH REASONS', convinced that he's doing the right thing. Then he bangs them for 'love', It sounds like this dude hasn't even had a good nut for the last decade of his entire life. Remember the 'health reasons' pedophiliac sex? We'll get to it right away. [b] FILLER LOLI IMOUTO WHO WANTS TO BANG HER BIG BROTHER [/b] This bitch is outright creepy and fucked, i only played two volumes and i can already tell this person isn't 10 nor human, this is some alien wanting to infiltrate human society by seeing if a brother would actually bang his own 10 year old sister. Since Kashou has got real sex slaves under his complete sentimental and legal control then he might aswell go for it [b] ショコラ and FUCKING バニラ [/b] These are the two sprites that more people have masturbated to than they'd like to admit or everyone else would like to. The first of them is your generic anime character made for comedic relief and the second is a lesbian tsundere- yes you heard that right. LESBIAN TSUNDERE. Or bisexual, i don't even know already. They both love their master and want to embrace his D. [b] POLYGAMY [/b] This game embraces polygamy that's it. Okay, i'll be fair about this. Maybe i'm looking too superficially at Nekopara, i found something interesting about it, by paying attention to detail on all the details of it's worldbuilding. I'll start off by some keypoints:  [u] Genetical Engineering [/u] Okay, let's be honest, it doesn't make any sense realistically speaking but bare with me, i'm going to defend my thesis on how Nekopara portrays a dystopian Japan that hasn't evolved in the slightest in terms of gender equality. First of all, remember we're talking about the CAT part of CATGIRLS ; This means, all 'nekos' in this game aren't Hominids with some feline characteristics, it's Felines with humanoid characteristics, this mean genetical engineering has advanced a lot by the time of this games story. Which doesn't sound like a lot; These felines have developed a limited range of human emotions but they're not quite on the level of free thought ; in fact, with just treating them well they'll like to bang you as soon as they hit puberty, which is about 3 to 4 years in. (Chocola is legal in cat years!!! LMAO!!!) [u] Social critic on Sexism [/u] It is widely known that Japan is an incredibly patriarchal society where women traditionally refer to their husbands as their 'owners' , but Nekopara i think is trying to make a social critic, putting our main lead as just a nice dude but making the two main girls act like his slaves and at the same time entering a romantic relationship- You see where i'm getting here? The owners thought this up all along, it's a message to open our eyes and to stop sexism, and to strive for the complete freedom of all sentient life, something necessary in our galaxy- And this world! The engineering of catgirls is unethical, since catboys don't even exist, they're created in order to be slaves of the human, and every hominid who dares bang their catgirl is being a zoophiliac and just abusing their slaves and turning them into real dolls. Open your eyes people, [b]NEKOWORKS IS TRYING TO SEND AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE, AND ALL YOU DO IS UNZIP YOUR PANTS. THIS GAME IS WRONG. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS MORALLY WRONG. THE SOCIETY IN THIS GAME IS WRONG. therefore i recommend this game[/b]",okay this is a honest review of nekopara vol1 and the observations i made playing this japanese masterpiece to start off i thorougly cringed and laughed playing this game specially from chapter 4 onwards now i  dont  buying this game i didnt personally if you have any of the following things  ethics a life a will to live lets start with the  about nekofuckingpara b our main lead harem protagonist b ご主人mastersama as refered to by his slaves or  kashou  by normal people standards this dude is an outright pedophiliac and zoophiliac to every extent now im going to be honest here this dude being out in society is a danger for everyone he doesnt only at first bang his slaves yes his slaves because he is the owner of the two humanoid catgirl sex dolls  he first bangs them for health reasons convinced that hes doing the right thing then he bangs them for love it sounds like this dude hasnt even had a good nut for the last decade of his entire life remember the health reasons pedophiliac sex well get to it right away b filler loli imouto who wants to bang her big brother b this bitch is outright creepy and fucked i only played two volumes and i can already tell this person isnt 10 nor human this is some alien wanting to infiltrate human society by seeing if a brother would actually bang his own 10 year old sister since kashou has got real sex slaves under  sentimental and legal control then he might aswell go for it b ショコラ and fucking バニラ b these are the two sprites that more people have masturbated to than theyd like to admit or everyone else would like to the first of them is your generic anime character made  relief and the second is a lesbian tsundere yes you heard that right lesbian tsundere or bisexual i dont even know already they both love their master and want to embrace his d b polygamy b this game embraces polygamy thats it okay ill be fair about this maybe im looking too superficially at nekopara i found something interesting about it by paying attention to detail on all the details of its worldbuilding ill start off by some keypoints  u  engineering u okay lets be honest it doesnt make any sense realistically speaking but bare with me im going to defend my thesis on how nekopara portrays a dystopian japan that hasnt evolved in the slightest in terms of gender equality first of all remember were talking about the cat part of catgirls  this means all nekos in this game arent hominids with some feline characteristics its felines with humanoid characteristics this mean  engineering has advanced a lot by the time of this games story which doesnt sound like a lot these felines have developed a limited range of human emotions but theyre not quite on the level of free thought  in fact with just treating them well theyll like to bang you as soon as they hit puberty which is about 3 to 4 years in chocola is legal in cat years lmao u social critic on sexism u it is widely known that japan is an incredibly patriarchal society where women traditionally refer to their husbands as their owners  but nekopara i think is trying to make a social critic putting our main lead as just a nice dude but making the two main girls act like his slaves and at the same time entering a romantic relationship you see where im getting here the owners thought this up all along its a message to open our eyes and to stop sexism and to strive for  freedom of all sentient life something necessary in our galaxy and this world the engineering of catgirls is unethical since catboys dont even exist theyre created in order to be slaves of the human and every hominid who dares bang their catgirl is being a zoophiliac and just abusing their slaves and turning them into real dolls open your eyes people bnekoworks is trying to send an important message and all you do is unzip your pants this game is wrong everything about this is morally wrong the society in this game is wrong therefore i  this gameb,NEG,0.9134858250617981

"This novel isn't for perverts.  If you're thinking about getting this game because it's got catgirls dressed up as maids with boobs, and you think that's sexy, then you *may* buy this game, you may crank up the chest bounciness meter as high as it can go, but if you are capable of sentiment, even in the slightest, then you're better off not reading it all the way through, and just sticking to the first few screens of bouncy catgirl boobs. Why?  Because, if you go any further, you WILL become emotionally attached to this game and its characters, and you won't be able to get off to it anymore. You'd best be sticking to something like Sakura Spirit for that sort of thing.  This game...this novel...it's something else. I was gifted this game by a friend of mine. I honestly didn't expect much at first. I just thought he got it me as a joke, and it was going to end up like one of those other visual novels centred on sex or the like.  I was wrong. And I think it deserves a proper review.  First off, there's the story. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but it's very well presented. It never once felt sex orientated. For the most part, the narrative was well paced, and the content was powerfully emotional and heart wrenchingly touching at times. I mean POWERFUL. Trust me, there were a few times through the story where I nearly cried. The story doesn't just deal with the theme of love. It deals with other themes such as loyalty, determination, family, selflessness and self-sacrifice. It weaves all of these themes into a beautiful yarn that wraps hard around your heartstrings and doesn't let go. It did seem to sacrifice narrative for...""Liberties"" at times, but it's only to be expected. Sometimes, that's what people come to see.  The story is also structured solidly by its attention to detail. They could've just left it at; ""There are catgirls in this world, and that's that"", but they don't. They provide not only a reason for the catgirls coming to be, but also detail on how politics deal with the issue of an overabundance of catgirls, information on their behaviour, as well as their place in society and how they are treated. They don't really go into detail about any ""Catboys"", though. What? They also give detail on the catgirls’ mating cycle and their inability to produce young with humans, but they don't mention how they have been able to reproduce. Anyway, that's just a small nitpick.  Next, the writing. The game has its own sense of humour that expresses itself constantly. Not too much, letting up at tender moments, bringing greater contrast to its sentimental narrative. It's witty, and has a varied palette of different kinds of humour, stemming from cute humour, to blunt humour...It even makes the occasional dirty joke. Again, even though there are quite a few deliberate innuendos scattered around the story, it doesn't ever feel like it focuses on sex for appeal or humour, only occasionally applying it for the effect the other audience desires. Notice I said; ""Other audience"".  I say this because I believe it was created for the purpose of appealing to a demographic that desired emotional relationships, not sexual ones. Sure, it hints at it here and there, but ultimately, it goes for the audience that feels, rather than the one that...""feels"".  As for the graphics, it's spectacular. The cutscenes and backgrounds are well drawn and detailed, with bright inviting colours, but that's not the star attraction. What's important here is the animation. Yes, animation. In a visual novel. Oh come on, just how did you think the ""chest bounciness"" slider was going to be used if the characters didn't MOVE? And oh, do they. The art style may be reminiscent of visual novels of the past, but the characters are far from static. They move even when standing still. You can see every breath they take, every gesture they make, every single movement is smoothly animated and articulated, and...*sigh*, if you really care about that sort of thing, the boobs do move realistically as well, and respond well to the respective slider.  For its attention to detail, story, romance, sparkling wit and of course, the animation, I would recommend it to any catgirl fan who wants genuine romance, not just sex.  Overall - 8.5/10 A beautiful story that flows well, but the whole ""cat"" gimmick may be too cheesy for some.

Just check the game out for yourself to see whether you like it or not. Search what visual novels (or hentai games) are and see if you're willing to try them.

It looks standard, feels standard, the story is standard, everything is standard. Second, there is no H stuff unless you specifically purchase the additional patches. And even then the H stuff is standard too. Feel free to ask me how I know, but it's not worth the time.     That said, I recommend it solely on the basis that people who enjoy visual novels won't have a bad time with this. But if you don't, don't waste your (or your friend's) money.

"Kashou (the main character) left his home to open a cake shop. One day he receives two cardboard boxes in the mail, shipped to him by his younger sister Shigure. The boxes contain two of his adopted catgirls he left at home, Chocola and Vanilla. Kashou wants to send the cat-girls back, but they show that they can be useful as maids in his shop, so he decides to let them stay. The animations are great, the soundtrack as well as the  colourful artwork radiates happiness and the voice acting is pleasant. The story is average and pretty predictable since it's a hentai game. Be careful and play this alone, this game doesn't only have hentai scenes, but it can be cringe sometimes. If you want to be called a weeb by your friends and a failure by your family, play it where everyone can see it. Buying this game on steam will give you a censored version.

"[i]Ooh... the heresy, he's doing an[/i] actual [i]review for Nekopara![/i] Nekopara is not really a game; it's a visual novel, more specifically, a kinetic visual novel. Think of it as a little story, since all the interactivity you'll have with this will be limited to advancing the story forward and [i]occasionally[/i] pressing 'P' to make all dem sweet catgirls jump (after of course setting the chest bounciness to whatever you want). Nekopara is essentially set in a near-future (or alternative) Japan where genetically engineered catgirls have been normalised. Catgirls are second-class citizens who must prove that they are able the act independently before being allowed to. However, this background tells you squat about what it's actually like, as this story focuses on Kashou Minadzuki (his name is usually romanised as Minaduki) as he founds a new patisserie with two catgirls who mailed themselves to the newly-founded patisserie, Chocola and Vanilla. Initially, Kashou resists their pleas to work with him, but as time goes on, his affection for the two catgirls grows until they become his 'catpanions'. Just to warn you, though, this visual novel does admit that any romantic relationship does turn sexual in the end. Because Steam is a company based in the West, they apparently ban all explictly sexual scenes from all their games (while allowing some positively gruesome violence; what the hell is going on!?) even though there exist methods to bar the little kids from experiencing them. So the Steam version has been censored from the original 18+ version, which, funnily enough, can be re-integrated with the Steam version. And, from what I've heard, it's pretty intense. Nekopara is essentially a feel-good story. Whether that feel-good comes from the heartwarming love story that unfolds through ups and downs, or from having a good ol' jerk off is up to you. A visual novel like this, though, is more than just a 'picture book for adults', since you've got music, voice acting, and beatiful animation which is probably the best you can get without using 3D animation. If you're a cultural elitist who dictates that 'all good media is deep and meaningful, and that which is not is utter trash' then boy are you gonna hate this. But if you've grown sick of how Western media has gotten so 'gritty' and 'dramatic' then this is a welcome breath of fresh air. I say I recommend this visual novel, but I only recommend it for fellow otakus. Not for normies, people who can't adequately separate reality and fantasy enough to realise that what happens here should not be concerning, right-wing Christian fundamentalists, fourth-wave feminists (just thought I'd mention the artist is female) and [i]definitely[/i] none of the 'anti-weebs'.

Usuallt in my reviews I try to point out pros and cons of the reviewed game but this is not the case here. The game is simply flawless. Seriously,  The plot is as simple as it can possibly be, but the reason everyone (or at least 99% of people) is not the plot. It the ambience of the game. You look at the catgirls, you listen to the music, you read the dialogues and after 3 or 4 hours you ask yourself: ""Why I cannot get enough of this? Why do I want to play more?"".  Everything here is adorable. Every character is drawn perfectly, the music is as suitable as it gets and the dialogues are stupid. Yes, the most stupid dialogues in the history of VNs, but it makes the game itself. If not for them ""Nekopara"" games wouldn't have even the half of its charm and I mean it. Anime cliches are here and there but still I cannot imagine where they would suit more than here.  Characters + dialogues = 90% of ""Nekopara"". It is well known that if you don't have good characters in an anime-game it is trash. Well, the cutest catgirls you can find are here. In addition to cuteness they pretty charismatic so you will love them after first couple of minutes that you've seen them.  Lots of details like a cat on the tie that Azuki wears and straight pupils of the catgirls are the rest 10% percent of ""Nekopara""'s secret.

"I like this game a lot but was initially going to leave a review explaining why I wouldn't recommend it. In the midst of writing it though I came to the conclusion that doing so wouldn't be very fair and decided to talk about the two elephant girls in the room instead.  Firstly, it has absolutely no gameplay whatsoever. You can literally load it up, press autoplay, sit back and let the entire game play out before you without having to interact with it again. I'm no connoisseur of visual novels but I've played a few of them and this was a first for me. I went into it expecting to make the usual choices (which cat girl to be with, currying favour, dates etc.) and want potential buyers to aware that no such interactivity exists.  Secondly, the game is heavily censored on Steam, a platform that allows you to experience the likes of Hatred in their purest form. Patches can be acquired to remove said censorship but I was unable to get any of them to work with the Steam version no matter what methods I followed. Initially I was begrudgingly okay playing the censored version but a few points in the game made me feel like I was missing out on a lot of content - and I was. After a trip to the high seas, I realized that the hentai elements make up a sizeable chunk of the game. This became a double edged sword for me as I ended up feeling like the primary h-scene was extremely excessive and out of place with the tone and theme the game was setting. Your mileage is naturally going to vary here.

Random guy on the internet SILVER FOX creates a strawpoll to decide which visual novel to play next, and because his friends hate him, they all vote for the masterpiece that is NEKOPARA.[/i]  For years I have wondered if this series is actually any good and after playing it, I gotta say, not really a huge fan. I'll start off with the things I like about it because it wasn't all awful - the presentation overall is pretty nice, all of the characters have animations and I think a lot of effort went into it. They even have mouth movement! The CGs looks good too and I thought the music was pretty catchy.  The story is about a guy named Kashou moving out of his house to start up a bakery/sweets shop/whatever so he can start a new life without telling his family. However, 2 boxes arrive and contain 2 catgirls - Chocola and Vanilla. Shenanigans happen. I found the best parts of this game are when they do cat-like things like getting drunk from catnip.  Outside of that there isn't much to say. The story was predictable, the game is clearly an eroge that has been censored since they show you what happens before and after the sex scenes instead of writing them out and as a comedy it isn't really that funny. At least in my opinion. If you're interested in this game then you've probably played it already, and if you liked it then that's fine, but I don't really get it.

"Here is my review of Nekopara Vol. 1  I really liked the game. The game tells the beginning of the story. From little nekos to big nekos. The music is also top again. 😄  A long story with lots of text and lots of animations. You can set the jiggle physics again. For the anime tiddies. 😅 You can unlock several achievements. 😉  Well, the humor speaks for itself and the atmosphere is nice too. I'm happy with the game. 😁  Feeling and Characters:  Protagonists: Kashou Minaduki, Chocola, Vanilla, Maple, Shigure Minaduki, Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon and Coconuts.

"Rating: 6/10 (""Decent"")  Recommended for: People who enjoy VNs, people who like slice of life, people who like cute things. I would not recommend this to a first time VN reader.  Nekopara Volume 1 (presumably) serves as an introduction to the series Nekopara, an episodic visual novel that centres around the main character, Kashou, and his bakery. He is helped by his multitude of catgirls, basically girls with cat ears, tails, and cat-tendencies. In-universe, they're generally treated as sub-human and as pets. They appear to have regular cat lifespans in (mostly) human bodies.  The premise is very obviously an excuse for a relaxing slice of life VN, and that is what Nekopara is. There are no choices to make and no branching paths to follow; it is all very linear. All you need to enjoy it is to click through it. It took me just under 5 hours to read the whole visual novel, which is decent, but a little short for its cost in my opinion. Of course, I read volume 1 without the H scenes, so perhaps those add a sizable chunk to reading time.   Nekopara boasts impressive production values; the character sprites are extremely detailed, and are also animated to go along with character movements and speech. Clothing is beautiful and full of different nuances. Backgrounds are very good and match the quality of the character sprites. The best thing about the game, however, is its CGs: they are colourful, vibrant, and exceptional. Without a doubt, most of Nekopara's value is in its artwork and the cuteness of the characters.  Speaking of the characters, the VN introduces Kashou, Shigure (his sister), and the many catgirls: Vanilla, Chocola, Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon, and Coconuts. This volume mainly focuses on Kashou's relationship with Vanilla and Chocola. Judging by the descriptions of the rest of the volumes, they will likely cycle to focus on the catgirls that did not receive as much attention during volume 1. That being said, all the characters are quite distinguishable, and all have different personalities.  The soundtrack was not particularly memorable, but it served its purpose.  In general, Nekopara Volume 1 was a cute slice of life VN to pass the time and relax. I might pick up the rest of the series when it is on sale.",rating 610 decent   for people who enjoy vns people who like slice of life people who like cute things i would not  this to a first time vn reader  nekopara volume 1 presumably serves as an introduction to the series nekopara an episodic visual novel that centres around the main character kashou and his bakery he is helped by his multitude of catgirls basically girls with cat ears tails and cattendencies inuniverse theyre generally treated as subhuman and as pets they appear to have regular cat lifespans in mostly human bodies  the premise is very obviously an excuse for a relaxing slice of life vn and that is what nekopara is there are no choices to make and no branching paths to follow it is all very linear all you need to enjoy it is to click through it it took me just under 5 hours to read the whole visual novel which is decent but a little short for its cost in my opinion of course i read volume 1 without the h scenes so perhaps those add a sizable chunk to reading time   nekopara boasts impressive production values the character sprites are extremely detailed and are also animated to go along with character movements and speech clothing is beautiful and full of different nuances backgrounds are very good and match the quality of the character sprites the best thing about the game however is its cgs they are colourful vibrant and exceptional without a doubt most of nekoparas value is in its artwork and the cuteness of the characters  speaking of the characters the vn introduces kashou shigure his sister and the many catgirls vanilla chocola azuki maple cinnamon and coconuts this volume mainly focuses on kashous relationship with vanilla and chocola judging by the descriptions of the rest of the volumes they will likely cycle to focus on the catgirls that did not receive as much attention during volume 1 that being said all the characters are quite distinguishable and all have different personalities  the soundtrack was not particularly memorable but it served its purpose  in general nekopara volume 1 was a cute slice of life vn to pass the time and relax i might pick up the rest of the series when it is on sale,NEU,0.8366259336471558

"So I beat this game or more like Visual Novel. Usually, I dont see games on a high critical level, but this was a game I had some on. It was highly favoured and since I had some money left for the holiday sale, I said ""why not?"" and bought it. Many people told me ""buy it, it's good, you won't regret it!"" If I can share these people's opinion...we'll see.  TL;DR: 5/10. Definetly needs to be better to be actually worth 10€  The game looks very good, the graphics are (what I call them) ""modern-anime-style"" and with that absolutly good. It's fun reading the dialogues and it felt kind of good reading the whole thing. But this is where probelms start: The story is (imo) way too narrow, it's exactly how I expected the story to go. This happens, they do this as rection. I give you some spoiler-examples *SPOILERS AHEAD* [spoiler]The master has fun with this cat girls, he thinks, since it's a common thing to have catpanions,  loving them is ok. He gets ill, the girls help him by going out, the obligatory drama ""we forgot our bells at home! we swear we belong to somebody!""[/spoiler] *SPOILER END* I tried to keep my expectations as low as possible since this is my first visual novel. But by doing exactly what I think's gonna happen...at least you dont make me completly satisfied. I do not want to say the story is bad at all! For what the story is, it's alright and enjoyable. A little thing that I didnt like that much, but isnt a big game breaker at all: (again, what I thought) You have all those adorable, beautiful catgirls and yet you get to experience what happens with 2 of them? This is where I gotta ask: Will we know more about the others in other Nekoparas? If no, then this is absolutly not ok imo. I'd really like to know more about Coconut or Cinnamon (tits yuheeeeeeee) If yes...well, the typical way to provide the user his information: We make a whole new game/story for some money. I dont want to say that is a bad thing, but I remember ye olden days where we got our stuff for free or we got games where we had so many stories in one game that we could play it for a massive amount of hours and we still didnt know anything. (yet again, I dont want to say the story is bad) But for focusing on 2 characters, the story is quite good.  Another thing I have to mention: The H-patch. Yes, there is one. you get hentaiscenes as you further progress through the game IF YOU HAVE THE H-PATCH DOWNLOADED UND INSTALLED. Google ""nekopara vol 1 h-patch"" and read the instructions carefully. that's it. Another thing to mention: If you have the H-Patch installed, you should be able to see if the H.Patch works if Chocola and Vanilla feel hot and it pretty much leads in an obvious way to the H-scenes What can I say about the scenes? They are well made, I actually didnt expect moving scenes tbh! But the sounds were...well, you can hear that the game isn't focusing on the H-scenes. But as a sweet, little addition, I enjoyed them (no, I did not (yet) masturbate to them).  Overall, I give the game a 5/10. But imo, I wouldn't pay 10€ for it. Maybe 7, let's say 5. But 10€ is way too much. Maybe I just had too high expectations, who knows.  Play the game for yourself and get your own opinion! In the end, it's just me who thinks this way :)",so i beat this game or more like visual novel usually i dont see games on a high critical level but this was a game i had some on it was highly favoured and since i had some money left for the holiday sale i said why not and bought it many people told me buy it its good you wont regret it if i can share these peoples opinionwell see  tldr 510  needs to be better to be actually worth 10  the game looks very good the graphics are what i call them modernanimestyle and with that absolutly good its fun reading the dialogues and it felt kind of good reading the whole thing but this is where probelms start the story is imo way too narrow its exactly how i expected the story to go this happens they do this as rection i give you some spoilerexamples spoilers ahead spoilerthe master has fun with this cat girls he thinks since its  thing to have catpanions  loving them is ok he gets ill the girls help him by going out the obligatory drama we forgot our bells at home we swear we belong to somebodyspoiler spoiler end i tried to keep my expectations as low as possible since this is my first visual novel but by doing exactly what i thinks gonna happenat least you dont make  satisfied i do not want to say the story is bad at all for what the story is its alright and enjoyable a little thing that i didnt like that much but isnt a big game breaker at all again what i thought you have all those adorable beautiful catgirls and yet you get to experience what happens with 2 of them this is where i gotta ask will we know more about the others in other nekoparas if no then this is absolutly not ok imo id really like to know more about coconut or cinnamon tits yuheeeeeeee if yeswell the ty way to provide the user his information we make a whole new gamestory for some money i dont want to say that is a bad thing but i remember ye olden days where we got our stuff for free or we got games where we had so many stories in one game that we could play it for a massive amount of hours and we still didnt know anything yet again i dont want to say the story is bad but for focusing on 2 characters the story is quite good  another thing i have to mention the hpatch yes there is one you get hentaiscenes as you further progress through the game if you have the hpatch downloaded und installed google nekopara vol 1 hpatch and read the instructions carefully thats it another thing to mention if you have the hpatch installed you should be able to see if the hpatch works if chocola and vanilla feel hot and it pretty much leads in an obvious way to the hscenes what can i say about the scenes they are well made i actually didnt expect moving scenes tbh but the sounds werewell you can hear that the game isnt focusing on the hscenes but as a sweet little addition i enjoyed them no i did not yet masturbate to them  overall i give the game a 510 but imo i wouldnt pay 10 for it maybe 7 lets say 5 but 10 is way too much maybe i just had too high expectations who knows  play the game for yourself and get your own opinion in the end its just me who thinks this way,POS,0.9776003956794739

"Okay, so, uh... yeah.  I bought this game sort of on a whim, and my initial thought process was ""I've heard this was basically hentai so, being the type of person who is entertained by witnessing some depraved shit, I'm gonna get all 4 volumes and see what the deal is.""  Naturally I discovered that's not all there was to it. I was missing something. Yes, indeed:  THE 18+ DLC.  I bought it after a great deal of mental preparation and hesitation. I regret nothing.  I'll start by giving a simple pro/con list for the steam version of the game, the ""All-Ages"" version.  PROS: -Breathtaking art style, fluent animations and excellent attention to detail. Easily one of the most beautifully crafted VNs I've seen or played. Of course, I'm also just a sucker for anime. Sue me. -The voiceovers, while entirely in Japanese, are excellent. Delivery is great, display of emotion is great, and the actresses fit their characters well, with clear differences in tone, pitch and delivery. -The story, while basically just a slice-of-life with some deeper elements thrown in, grips you well enough that you want to keep going (pun intended, you'll know why later.) -Characters are all interesting, some more than others, but you won't dislike a single one. Even Shigure, who has a rather uncomfortable big brother complex going on. -The soundtrack is upbeat when it needs to be, solemn when it doesn't. There's a pleasant mix of piano tracks and poppy, electronic tracks, along with some more traditional anime-like tracks with a jazzy vibe.  CONS: -The dialogue and general script, as is unfortunately the case with almost all JP > EN translations, fails to deliver a truly realistic representation of how one would speak in English. Things like ""Ahh..."" or ""That's not...!"" Some people might not consider this a con, especially since the characters all speak, meaning the text should be a true translation. More of a personal quirk I suppose. -Minor typos here and there. Easy to miss, honestly. -The story, due to the nature of it, lacks tragedy. Fortunately, everything else is delivered well enough that this may only be a setback for some. Still figured I'd mention it.   NOW THEN... Allow me to move on to the FULL version of the game, which I have. This pro/con list is strictly going to cover what the 18+ dlc (re)introduces. I won't be graphic in order to keep my review readable, but I will be detailed enough to get the point across  PROS: -Since the H-scenes were done by the same artist, the comment I made about the art style applies here as well. -The scenes are exaggerated, but not to the point of just not making any sense. If you're not getting what I'm saying, let's just say instead of the girls looking like they just hopped out of the ocean, they look like they maybe fell in a puddle or... something. -THEY ARE ANIMATED -The entire scene is voiced (Minus Kashou of course). This can be a con if you're the type that can't handle the sound of a voice actress making rather realistic sexual sounds. -Again, not much of a hentai guy, but the scenes are really well done for what they are. Not much else to say really... at the end of the day, you're paying $30 for hentai.  CONS: -Again, with the translations, shit doesn't always make sense. Without being specific, sometimes word usage in certain ""situations"" is off-putting. Even thought the VAs may REALLY be saying these things, it's still a little uncomfortable to read. Again, I'm not usually a hentai kind of dude, so it could just be me. -Frequency is... well, frequent. Vol. 1 alone, after the initial 3-4 hours of introductory story, probably has a scene every 45 minutes of play time. There are 3 scenes. The 3rd lasts well over an hour. I only list this as a con because it sort of makes you feel like the game goes from a story-driven experience with some porn thrown in for taste, to a straight up H-VN with a little bit of story mixed in. -There is almost ALWAYS some kind of wet/sticky sound effect going on in the background. Sometimes it's fine, but for the most part it's just gross. I recommend either turning down the sound effects or turning them off entirely unless you enjoy the sound of macaroni that's been sitting for a while being spooned around.  With all of that being said, the game is super adorable. ESPECIALLY Chocola and Vanilla... even if they end up being defiled halfway through the game. Feelsbadman.  If you've gotten this far, congrats, you know what to expect. If you're looking for a TL;DR, here it is:  11/10 Catgirls are cute, there's hentai if you blow (giggity) the extra $30, the game is pretty, buy it now no regrats.",okay so uh yeah  i bought this game sort of on a whim and my initial thought process was ive heard this was basically hentai so being the type of person who is entertained by witnessing some depraved shit im gonna get all 4 volumes and see what the deal is  naturally i discovered thats not all there was to it i was missing something yes indeed  the 18 dlc  i bought it after a great deal of mental preparation and hesitation i regret nothing  ill start by giving a simple procon list for the steam version of the game the allages version  pros breathtaking art style fluent animations and excellent attention to detail easily one of the most beautifully crafted vns ive seen or played of course im also just a sucker for anime sue me the voiceovers while entirely in japanese are excellent delivery is great display of emotion is great and the actresses fit their characters well with clear differences in tone pitch and delivery the story while basically just a sliceoflife with some deeper elements thrown in grips you well enough that you want to keep going pun intended youll know why later characters are all interesting some more than others but you wont dislike a single one even shigure who has a rather  big  going on the soundtrack is upbeat when it needs to be solemn when it doesnt theres a pleasant mix of piano tracks and poppy electronic tracks along with some more traditional animelike tracks with a jazzy vibe  cons the dialogue and general script as is unfortunately the case with almost all jp  en translations fails to deliver a truly realistic representation of how one would speak in english things like ahh or thats not some people might not consider this a con especially since the characters all speak meaning the text should be a true translation more of a personal quirk i suppose minor typos here and there easy to miss honestly the story due to the nature of it lacks tragedy fortunately everything else is delivered well enough that this may only be a setback for some still figured id mention it   now then allow me to move on to the full version of the game which i have this procon list is strictly going to cover what the 18 dlc reintroduces i wont be graphic in order to keep my review readable but i will be detailed enough to get the point across  pros since the hscenes were done by the same artist  i made about the art style applies here as well the scenes are exaggerated but not to the point of just not making any sense if youre not getting what im saying lets just say instead of the girls looking like they just hopped out of the ocean they look like they maybe fell in a puddle or something they are animated the entire scene is voiced minus kashou of course this can be a con if youre the type that cant handle the sound of a voice actress making rather realistic sexual sounds again not much of a hentai guy but the scenes are really well done for what they are not much else to say really at the end of the day youre paying 30 for hentai  cons again with the translations shit doesnt always make sense without being specific sometimes word usage in certain situations is offputting even thought the vas may really be saying these things its still a little  to read again im not usually a hentai kind of dude so it could just be me frequency is well frequent vol 1 alone after the initial 34 hours of introductory story probably has a scene every 45 minutes of play time there are 3 scenes the 3rd lasts well over an hour i only list this as a con because it sort of makes you feel like the game goes from a storydriven experience with some porn thrown in for taste to a straight up hvn with a little bit of story mixed in there is almost always some kind of wetsticky sound effect going on in the background sometimes its fine but for the most part its just gross i  either turning down the sound effects or turning them off entirely unless you enjoy the sound of macaroni thats been sitting for a while being spooned around  with all of that being said the game is super adorable especially chocola and vanilla even if they end up being defiled halfway through the game feelsbadman  if youve gotten this far congrats you know what to expect if youre looking for a tldr here it is  1110 catgirls are cute theres hentai if you blow giggity the extra 30 the game is pretty buy it now no regrats,NEU,0.6099227070808411

"Eccchh...  This is the worst example of effort-porn I've ever seen. What is effort porn you may ask? It's a term I coined to describe interactive pornographic material designed to give lonely fuckers like me a sense of accomplishment and heightened sexual release once the game reaches it's climax, (Fuck the female). These types of games achieve that goal by stringing the player through a series of narrative loops and building up a connection between Fuckee & Fucker.   The loops are usually just red-herrings for sex scenes, making the player constantly go ""Ooo, Ooo Is this it?!?"" Only to be denied that and shoved back into the plot of the game.  Then finally, after (Hopefully not any longer than an hour) of degrading yourself by placing yourself in the narrative and building sexual desire for whatever animated titty creatures star in the game, You make a hefty withdrawal and bust a nut stronger, and more fierce than an average ""Meh"" Pornhub nut. Because of the time spent and the effort secreted, Your psyche views it as a more genuine experience, Making you feel slightly less lonely for a few minutes.  This game though... Oooo this game...  I just wanted to masturbate but I just kept getting angry at the poorly structured narrative.  TAKE A WRITING CLASS.  The entire fucking game is written like the cancerous ""Comedy"" scenes in Anime.  ""WOOOAAHH!!! WACCKKY!!! HE'S A TOTAL P E R V !! WACCCKKYYY!! WOAAAHHH!!""  And the game's attempts at... Ugh... ""Dramatic storytelling"" Come off as just so thinly veiled and contrived because of both the absolutely PITIFUL dialogue combined with the knowledge that this is all just supposed to be backing for nuttage.  And the first TWO HOURS of the game completely focuses around this trash!  If you're gonna spend two hours in a jack-off game on Sex-free narrative, At least try and make it interesting! Why not have animal control try and take the two main ""Catgirls""? Why not have there be some threat to the Bakery staying open?... OR SOMETHING!?  I feel like a dingus recommending serious plot points for a game about cumming inside cats but if they're gonna take that route anyway, Why wouldn't they at least try and interest me?... Instead of boring me to the point of physical pain with stories about how sentimental the cat people are, Or how much the main character's sister loves him. Jesus Christ, WHO CARES?!?!? JUST LET ME CUM!!!  And then the cherry on the motherfucking cat-vomit covered cake... They cut out the fucking sex scenes.  I'll be the first one to admit, I was goddamn hot and ready when they started the set up to the release. Thinking all the fucking hell of dealing with the horrid narrative was at least going to result in a top quality nut... Then it cut out.  ...What?... I was heavily confused.  Next thing you know, The screen fades into the living room of the main characters.  ...No.  (QUE OVERLY PRODUCED HAPPY MUSIC) WOOOAHHH!!! KOOOKY HIJINKS!!!!)  I turned the game off and cried.  I spent 4 hours belittling myself and didn't even get to have a good wank. Fucking pitiful.

"NEKOPARA is a VN based on Pantheon becoming what he wanted, except his personal space was invited by his family's Nekos*. Instead of filing a restraining order, he keeps them with him.  The VN novel itself is mediocre at best, with a few key elements. First, it's one of the few VN's to be animated, and not some pictures wired up (Though at parts, there are pictures, though this is obvious). Another key element is that the VNs are Voice-Acted (VA), thus bringing in MORE spirit.  One of the main attractions for me, however, was that the game contains hentai. To get the uncensored version you either: -A: Pay for the uncensored version online, and apply a patch to the Steam version -B: Pirate said patch -or C: Buy the uncensored version online, then set it to be a Steam game.  The main problem is that the game lures you with hentai, should you be a fan of hentai, and then makes you pay an extra 10 dollars, which just screams BS.  One of the problems I've had that's very common with the game is ''Invalid character AE''. If you don't want to deal with said problem, install the VN on C: instead of D:.

"10/10, would be emotionally coerced into sleeping with nine-months-old anthropomorphic house pets again...? :s  Slightly more seriously speaking, I've probably approached this game from an unusual angle, as I wasn't looking for porn and didn't download the 18+ patch, but I knew how much praise the whole series gathered over the years and wanted to check it out for myself. What I found was:  + Absolutely beautiful visuals, with sprites, CGs, Backgrounds... Everything being georgeous. + Awesome scripting with animated sprites done maybe better than anywhere else, creating a lively experience you wouldn't expect from a VN. + Tons of cuteness and adorableness. + Good music.  But also:  - Extremely creepy owner/pet romance that made me uncomfortable even without seeing the H-scenes. - Creepy brocon subplot with the protagonist's little sister (who would be otherwise an adorable character). - Paper-thin story and absurd setting that doesn’t really try making sense. - Writing generally not on par with the visual quality.  [b]As a kinetic novel, it was definitely well-produced and fun to read, but not really exceptional in anything but the graphics.

"NekoPara Volume 1 takes place from the perspective of a man named Kashou Minaduki, whom is part of a long line of Japanese confection makers. His sister has also been raising quite a few catgirls, some of whom have become attached to him over recent months and years. Seeking to forge his own path in the industry, Kashou decides to leave home and open his own patisserie by the name of “La Soleil” – completely in secret to avoid the attention of his family. Originally it was his plan to run this cafe by himself, without the assistance of either his family or any catgirls he left behind. But this all changes when he finds two unopened boxes sitting in the shop with some perplexing notices on them. The noises from the box show that two of the catgirls his sister was raising: the enthusiastic Chocola and more docile Vanilla, have decided to stay by his side and help run the shop. Although willing to send them back home at first, events that follow see him deciding to keep the two on board – as they begin their life of running La Soleil together.  + r18 patch + cute nekos + boobs bounciness (press ""P"" to see the magic)",nekopara volume 1 takes place from the perspective of a man named kashou minaduki whom is part of a long line of japanese confection makers his sister has also been raising quite a few catgirls some of whom have  attached to him over recent months and years seeking to forge his own path in the industry kashou decides to leave home and open his own patisserie by the name of la soleil  in secret to avoid the attention of his family originally it was his plan to run this cafe by himself without the assistance of either his family or any catgirls he left behind but this all changes when he finds two unopened boxes sitting in the shop with some perplexing notices on them the noises from the box show that two of the catgirls his sister was raising the enthusiastic chocola and more docile vanilla have decided to stay by his side and help run the shop although willing to send them back home at first events that follow see him deciding to keep the two on board  as they begin their life of running la soleil together   r18 patch  cute nekos  boobs bounciness press p to see the magic,NEU,0.946199893951416

"Got to admit, I think the sexual content actively interferes with the novel. Steam's censored version is the version I played and thankfully skips past the actual adult scenes and is one of the only instances where I feel like it would have been an inferior experience, but even in Steam's version the implications of what happened doesn't feel quite right.  Fortunately, that's about the only notable issue for me. It's otherwise an enjoyable experience in seeing the relationship develop between Kashou and his unexpected catgirls Chocola and Vanilla, especially as the catgirls struggle to fully understand the way humanity works. Seeing the three earnestly try to pursue what they believe to be the best for them all while trying to understand the bonds they have was very nice.  Nekopara is not without its humour and the novel delivers well on this too. A lot of it ends up tying into the catgirl tendencies to slip into cat-like behaviour, and while I wouldn't say every joke worked it definitely hit the mark more plenty to make it worthwhile.  It was also great to see the E-mote system in use for the visuals. The last time I'd seen this was Tokyo School Life, and the implementation here is even better as they're able to give some illusion of talking, walking about or leaning to the side as a few examples. While it's not the norm for visual novels the impact is massive and I do wish it would become more commonplace.

With that corteous behaivor, cold and mysterious look in her eyes, sharp piercing phrases, calm and reserved barely recognizable emotions, rare soft and genuine tenderness - all that kindly teasing stuff makes [b]Vanilla[/b] truly catching one. Oh [b]Vanilla[/b]'s really makes my mind melt. She's more [i]kuudere[/i] than [i]dandere[/i] character to me.  [*][url=https://youtu.be/MWDFRIL7LoQ][b]Chocola[/b][/url]. [spoiler]Eheh, that's where the verge of crime becomes barely visible[/spoiler]. I like Chocola, her energetic mood always cheers me up, she's a really adorable one. A happy-go-lucky neko, I'm in love with her sincerity. Her innocent and genuine elated character, truly optimistic, sparkling eyes, exciting cute voice - all of it makes Chocola really really great. Truly, genki + moe char. [*][url=https://youtu.be/isJEI88_ZgI][b]Coconut[/b][/url]. Oh my, she's the best. She's quite different from the other nekos. Tall, athletic, smart, doing some martial arts. Even she's young, you can suppose like she's the elder one. Confident and cool, she's really modest and kindhearted from the inside. As she says about herself: [i]""...I think I'd rather be a cute catgirl than a cool one""[/i]. Also she's little bit shy, has some issues with low self-esteem and jelaous to other catgirls for their appearances. But for me, she's more than just good. She's gorgeous. Btw I really enjoy huge cute&clumsy shy girls too. She's a [i]Maine Coon[/i] neko [*][url=https://youtu.be/qVmrIZTE06U][b]Maple[/b][/url], kind, proud and also vigorous and extrovertous neko. She's quite a young lady. Sophisticated in some way. Well, trying to show that all the time - how be perfect and versatile. She's an [i]American Curl[/i] neko. [*][url=https://youtu.be/ccIkbzFxwjc][b]Cinnamon[/b][/url], kinda perverted Neko, maybe too much. Cinnamon makes me feel really awkward sometimes with her lewd and lecherous polysemantic phrases, but she's rather nice in her own special way. She's tender, even voluptuous character. [spoiler]Never liked overweighted melons though :D[/spoiler] So, I guess it's just a common moe character. She's a [i]Scottish Fold[/i] neko. [/olist]  [b]Kashou[/b]. Don't think that I might be able to say much about him, but, well, he's ambitious,  responsible, polite and most likely collective character, reasonable and collective in order to be compared to the player. Typical [i]""nice guy""[/i], he's the one the catgirls surely can rely on. [spoiler]Also, sometimes he's quite dumbass[/spoiler] To be honest, i like him anyway. I guess I should mention one more character, [url=https://youtu.be/WgJM99I_IAw][b]Shigure[/b][/url], [b]Kashou[/b]'s younger sister. To tell you the truth, she's not the person who can actually make you feel something more than common character interest. Not really catching. I guess the very plot needs her in order to be more logical and sense-making, to make whole story cohergent.

That is really niiiice! The actual seiyus done great piece of work! Well, that's really looks awesome, making them even more charismatic, catching and loveable. Because of highly developed anime voicing industry in Japan, all those characters are greatly sparkling and outstanding, I am really enjoying their different personalities. [spoiler]Aaand...in R-18 cutscenes the voice is actually doing about half of the work, ya know ;)[/spoiler]  [h1]Plot[/h1] Well you all should know the plot, it's simple and consistent, just th way it should be in such game. Well, I wish I could have had more influence to the game process like choices or smth, but whatever.  [quote=Wiki]Kashou Minaduki is an aspiring chef who moves away from home to open his own confection shop. While he is unpacking in his new shop, he discovers that two of his family's Nekos, Chocola and Vanilla, came along with him by hiding in cardboard boxes. After the two Nekos convince Kashou to let them stay and live with him, the three of them work together to run his shop, ""La Soleil"".

"So having completed Volume 1, I have to say that this game was surprisingly entertaining.  I picked it up in a bundle deal and I just thought I'd give it a spin to see what it's like.  The character art is certainly NEKOPARA's strong point, the character desings are well done and having them have an animated aspect really put it a cut above the visual novels out there with static graphics.  Chocola and Vanilla are able to emote and thanks to the stellar art it really helps drive home the emotions of the script.  And as someone who worked in the culinary industry I could relate to the struggle the MC was dealing with; which is always a plus.  The only downside is that this game is that you're locked in to one route, so you better enjoy the ride. I suspect that since there are other volumes of the game out there, they might focus more on the other characters introduced in Volume 1.  Though there is one character that I hope they don't, just to avoid dealing with certain taboos.  This game is at it's best when it's light hearted and silly.  So in conclusion; give NEKOPARA a shot.

"A truly distopian world wrapped in a kusoge shell.  [spoiler] Some time in the recent past, scientists have created a successful human-cat hybrid creature, all of which are female.  Their growth patterns are bizarre, combining ""cat years"" and human physiological growth to develop an adult at a mere one to two years of life.  As a side effect of the hybridization, they are born infertile.  As the hybrids grow in popularity, Japan's legal system develops a crude set of regulations to keep the new pseudospecies in check.  Catgirls, as they are informally regarded, must have legal documentation on hand at all times, or they may be arrested and detained.  They must be owned by a documented citizen, and may only be employed by express concent of their owner. [/spoiler]  All of this is explicitly detailed in the roughly two to three hours of text composing NekoPara Vol. 1.

Kashou discovers that two of his family's cats, Chocola and Vanilla, has followed him and allows them to stay by helping out with the new store.  Nekopara is slightly different compared to VNs of the past where sprites are not used. Instead the game relys on ""E-mote"" system where characters are brought to life.

"I expected this to be a mindless, plotless bit of cute fluff and lewdness that I could tab over to during downtime in other games.  Instead, I plumbed the depths of human depravity in an unintentional horror story about an eerie world in which people are chattel, either abandoned to die hopeless and alone or treated as a mix of animal and idiot child unless their owners feel like fucking them. The developers of Nekopara needed to tackle the question of how their faceless, voiceless player self-insert vehicle would come to live in a cramped apartment with a bevy of amorous catgirls.   They had many options. They chose, apparently totally blind to the implications, the option in which humanity uplifts another terrestrial species to human levels of intelligence, but then elects to keep them as pets/slaves/sex toys, maintaining a system of psychological degradation and police-enforced dependence in order to keep them docile and reliant on their masters.  And nobody comments on this intensely unethical behavior--in fact, it is so normal that people publically praise individuals who chose to maintain sexual relations with sophonts who are a) their property, b) in an extremely submissive relationship (in terms of power dynamics), c) viewed as nonhuman animals or children by most of the population.  That's purely the worldbuilding. I could comment on the fetishization of mating seasons or the usual pseudo-incestuous relationships, but frankly none of that could top the entirely unintentional creepiness of the worldbuilding which makes the plot possible.  Of course this probably came about because they used 90% of the budget animating sex scenes and boob jiggle, leaving their writers to subsist on the packaging from the instant noodles the rest of the team ate.

"[h1]OVERVIEW[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 is the second in the Nekopara series of anime visual novels from developer NEKO WORKs, published by Sekai Project. It was actually the first game released, but now has a fan-made prequel: Volume 0.  Nekopara Volume 1 introduces Kashou, a young man who has vacated the family home and moved into an apartment above his new bakery, Patisserie La Soleil. The game hints at various previous happenings in the family that have led Kashou to move out and attempt to start his adult life again on his own. While moving in, Kashou discovers that two large and unfamiliar boxes have been left in the bakery by the movers. When he opens them, he finds Chocola and Vanilla, the two youngest catgirls in the Minaduki family, waiting inside.  If you're not familiar with Nekopara lore already, catgirls are genetically modified human female / cat hybrids, who are partly treated as pets and partly as valuable family members. They are human-sized and with mostly human looks, but with ears, tails, and very feline personality traits. The Minaduki family's youngest member, Kashou's sister, Shigure, owns six of them, all with very distinct personalities: Vanilla, Chocola, Cinnamon, Coconut, Maple, and Azuki  For various reasons, not the least of them being emotional blackmail, Kashou ends up keeping the two catgirls around to help with setting up the bakery, and chooses to hire them as the shop's poster catgirls when La Soleil opens. He soon finds that to be legally employed or to travel around by themselves, the catgirls must pass a test and carry a bell-collar license with them at all times.  Volume 1 focuses on Kashou, Chocola, and Vanilla, in their efforts to open and run the bakery while also learning to live together.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] Graphics are extremely similar to Volume 0, with beautiful paper-doll cut outs and animated models of the catgirls over slightly blurry digitally painted backgrounds. As with Volume 0, animations are much more detailed and frequent than in any other visual novel series that I've seen.  The game has some different drawing styles in parts, including 'chibi' art.   [h1]Sound[/h1] As with Volume 0, both title and in-game music fall into the typical anime theme-song style, with upbeat electronic instruments and an elevator-music feel. The music is well produced and inoffensive, but not the sort of thing I'd listen to while on a long drive.  Sound effects are good, but few and far between, being used to punctuate the music and speech at appropriate places in the story.  All characters except the protagonist, Kashou, are fully voiced. Though I don't understand Japanese well, they seem quite professional to me and suit the personalities well. Sounds and voices are normalised well.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 plays like a traditional visual novel, with no player choices and thus only one available ending. The norm in the genre is to promote replayability through multiple available choices and multiple endings, so it seems a little bit of a letdown to have only a completely linear path with no real interaction available.  The game engine appears to be exactly the same one that is used in Volume 0, with features such as autoplay, skipping, backlog, multiple languages, animations, and the all-important chest bounciness. There are no real interaction points on the screen; all you do is click to advance to the next line of dialogue or the next scene where appropriate.  Though the game has the sexual content and nudity tags on its Steam store page, without the official adult patch it's actually very tame for an anime-themed visual novel. There's a mildly raunchy still shot of a shower scene, with censored nudity, and sex scenes, which are implied or talked about, but not actually shown. The patch is prohibitively expensive -- often more than the game itself -- so I wasn't able to review the adult version of the game.  The story is fairly typical of a manga, anime, or visual novel plot, with no real twists or surprises. It's mostly light hearted and fun, and there are a few genuinely funny parts. The translation isn't the best, but it's definitely passable. You may notice some poor grammar and weird sentences: ""She smiled with her usual tone of voice.""  The Achievements are almost all unmissable, though there's the same secret Achievement as in Volume 0.   [h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1] Pros: + The same attractive catgirl characters + Steam Achievements and Trading Cards + An adult patch is available, but ...  Cons: - ... the game is already a bit pricey, and the adult patch doubles the cost - Some grammatical errors and other weirdness - No choices or control; just watching and clicking  [h1]CONCLUSION[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 is an enjoyable visual novel with beautiful, lovable catgirl characters, but a somewhat banal script and no choices or real replayability. Anyone interested in the adult version of the game needs to realise it will cost them double the price of the 'safe' version on Steam, and the Steam version completely skips the erotic scenes that are included in the patch.

adult patch its actually very tame for an animethemed visual novel theres a mildly raunchy still shot of a shower scene with censored nudity and sex scenes which are implied or talked about but not actually shown the patch is prohibitively expensive  often more than the game itself  so i wasnt able to review the adult version of the game  the story is fairly ty of a manga anime or visual novel plot with no real twists or surprises its mostly light hearted and fun and there are a few genuinely funny parts the translation isnt the best but its definitely passable you may notice some poor grammar and weird sentences she smiled with her usual tone of voice  the achievements are almost all unmissable though theres the same secret achievement as in volume 0   h1pros and consh1 pros  the same attractive catgirl characters  steam achievements and trading cards  an adult patch is available but   cons   the game is already a bit pricey and the adult patch doubles the cost  some grammatical errors and other weirdness  no choices or control just watching and clicking  h1conclusionh1 nekopara volume 1 is an enjoyable visual novel with beautiful lovable catgirl characters but a somewhat banal script and no choices or real replayability anyone interested in the adult version of the game needs to realise it will cost them double the price of the safe version on steam and the steam  skips the erotic scenes that are included in the patch  autosave h1saveh1 save for later pause quit rage quit  codefor more game reviews visit  or quiturlcode,NEU,0.9516035318374634

"The first of the many games so far (4 games total atm Nekopara Vol1-3 and a prequel Vol 0)  Our main protagonist Kashou leaves his family and starts up his shop called La Soleil (a cake and patisserie/ Pastry shop)  When the unexpected happens two of his family ""cats"" Chocola and Vanilla ended up being delivered to his new store/home with him thanks to his sister   and then the adventures start with Kashou starting up his business and looking after her two catgirls or Neko's if you prefer.

What its story lacks in choices, it makes up for in a story with excellent characters and actual depth, which I personally find is lacking in most VNs. Though to be frank, the people who read VNs for the story is probably less than the ones... you get the idea :) Anyways, most of the characters (<3 to Chocola, lol :D) are amusingly quirky, the plot has some great twists to it, and it has a really solid ending - most VN's I've read tend to kind of flop at the end tbh.  A more than solid 10/10. Here's hoping the OVA is as good :) (Only thing I've ever supported via Kickstarter, so it better be, lol)  As a side note, ignore the playtime.

"Here's the review at least a few of you have been waiting for!  For those of you new to visual novels, Nekopara and games like it aren't really games. There are no decisions to be made, no changing the outcome of the story. Just like a book or a movie, you're merely observing as everything plays out.  This story is set in a world where genetically modified cat-girls are kept as pets and servants. The main character opens a bakery and his (oddly obsessive and possibly incestuous) sister sends him two cat-girls as companions to help him out.  The story is, to put it mildly, odd. It gets even stranger when the cat-girls become, ahem, ""interested"" in their master.  GAMEPLAY  There basically isn't any. You can advance the dialogue and you can interact with the characters in a limited way (by petting them). Again, this isn't really a game.  STORY  There's basically nothing else to Nekopara, so this had better be good. And it is. You'd never expect a story about running a bakery with two ""curious"" cat-girls to be interesting, but a good visual novel gets you invested in its characters. The two cat-girls are well-written and their personalities are quite distinct. The relationships develop somewhat naturally, as naturally as relationships between humans and genetically-modified cat-women can.  I *did* say it was weird.  GRAPHICS  Honestly, these matter more to a visual novel than you'd expect, since they're half of the game (the *visual* part of visual novel). And here's where the game absolutely shines. Not only are the characters extremely well designed and drawn, the animation is lifelike and fun. Since it is an H-game, there is adjustable bounce, but it seems somewhat odd to include it when neither of the characters it affects are particularly busty.  The backgrounds and settings are pretty average, but the characters themselves are so eye-catching and fun that it's never really an issue.  CONCLUSION  The game's weird, and not really a game. Those are two key points here. It's also (if modded to its intended content) an adult game. However, the story and art are fantastic and the animation is the icing on the cake. If you're the sort of person who doesn't mind games with extremely strange premises that are basically waifu simulators, then this is a really great game.  I give this game five cat-girls out of five.",heres the review at least a few of you have been waiting for  for those of you new to visual novels nekopara and games like it arent really games there are no decisions to be made no changing the  of the story just like a book or a movie youre merely observing as everything plays out  this story is set in a world where  modified catgirls are kept as pets and servants the main character opens a bakery and his oddly obsessive and possibly incestuous sister sends him two catgirls  to help him out  the story is to put it mildly odd it gets even stranger when the catgirls  ahem interested in their master  gameplay  there basically isnt any you can advance the dialogue and you can interact with the characters in a limited way by petting them again this isnt really a game  story  theres basically nothing else to nekopara so this had better be good and it is youd never expect a story about running a bakery with two curious catgirls to be interesting but a good visual novel gets you invested in its characters the two catgirls are wellwritten and their personalities are quite distinct the relationships develop somewhat naturally as naturally as relationships between humans and  catwomen can  i did say it was weird  graphics  honestly these matter more to a visual novel than youd expect since theyre half of the game the visual part of visual novel and heres where the game absolutely shines not only are the characters extremely well designed and drawn the animation is lifelike and fun since it is an hgame there is adjustable bounce but it seems somewhat odd to include it when neither of the characters it affects are particularly busty  the backgrounds and settings are pretty average but the characters themselves are so eyecatching and fun that its never really an issue  conclusion  the games weird and not really a game those are two key points here its also if modded to its intended content an adult game however the story and art are fantastic and the animation is the icing on the cake if youre the sort of person who doesnt mind games with extremely strange premises that are basically waifu simulators then this is a really great game  i give this game five catgirls out of five,NEU,0.8816136717796326

"Before I begin, yes. Yes this game is almost exsactly what you think it is. If you can't draw judgement from that, I'll elaborate.   This game is a visual novel, so not so much a game as much as it is a short story with some pictures and animations to go with it. You do not play it at all.  For what I was expecting, I actually got a lot more, though I""ll say my experience with visual novels is extremely thin. It has a great menu system. Everything is where you'd expect it to be, and there are a lot of options to help fine tune the game should you feel the need to. There's even a ""Bust bouncyness"" option, which thank the lord because it's akward to see them flounder like a fish whenever they make a move. It even comes with 80 save files for whatever reason.   Visually, it passes all the tests. Backgrounds and characters are detailed, and said characters are animated and fully voiced, minus the one male in the game. They even have proper lipsyncing and animations that play on queue to what is said. Though the farther into the game you go, the more you'll see repeating animations and movements. They serve their perpose well, but it does get old after a while.  The music is fine, good even. Nothing to hum to, but enough to set the mood. There's only five of them though, so expect to hear the same tracks many times.   Lastly, the writting... Kinda a mixed bag. What little lore they put in place makes complete sense and makes a great backdrop to the happenings of the game. Things don't tend to ""Just be like that"". It's coheisive and straight forward.  However, they hit all of the sugar sweet troupes for an anime of this type. Everyone loves the none discript main charecter, everyone is amazing by in game standerds, yadda yadda, you get the idea. You'll catch on to the true motives of the game really quickly. It's dangerously sweet, to excess even. I'll admit I was having fun for a while, but it wore off right around chapter 5 when things started settling in. The pacing is pretty shotty, like a photo album someone made of their favorite parts of a story, the biggest exsample being [spoiler] When the two cover catgirls are trying to obtain their bells, a sort of right of passage permit. One day the little sister know it all comes over to help them study for the first time  to the end of some hijinx, and the very next scene they're coming back from a delivery, bells firmly hung from their necks. No signs of an endevor or anything. [/Spoiler]  Can I reccomend the game? Honestly, I don't know if I have the right to. It's obvious that it has a very specific market it's trying to pitch itself to, even more blatently so in the R-18 version which, thankfully, was edited down in the steam version. My positive recomondation score is based purely off the effort that was put into the workings of the game and the effort that was obviously put into it. What you get out of the game is up to you. Just trust you gut on this one.  TLDR: Sugar, hold the spice, but leave the everything nice.

"I have a love-hate relationship with visual novels. I love the medium and its potential, but the unfortunate truth is that the vast majority of them -- even many popular ones -- have downright execrable writing. Fortunately, [i]NEKOPARA[/i] does not.  While [i]NEKOPARA[/i] occasionally stumbles by including a few of the typical ""visual novel-isms"" such as a bland protagonist (not too bland, thankfully), characters who state the obvious (though the game doesn't assume we're dumb), characters who announce their feelings (""You can't just have your characters announce how they feel! That makes me feel angry!""), and unnecessary flashbacks (mercifully few and brief), it is, to my amazement, well-written and intelligent for a visual novel and eroge.  The dialogue is, for the most part, passable with occasional flashes of brilliance and poetic constructions -- yes, really; there can rhythm and beauty in seemingly ordinary prose, even in the gutter -- and I have to admit that certain word choices really provided some much-needed scratching of itches. In addition, the dialogue often made curious use of English-language idioms which, to my utter disbelief, were not only used [i]correctly[/i] but also used in evocative ways. For that, I commend the writers and translators for their work.  You may find this hard to believe, but there is some thoughtful and intriguing world-building going on in the background of this silly little erotic visual novel. The idea, for instance, that the catgirls will be arrested if they wander around on their own -- that some catgirls have turned to crime to support themselves -- provides a brief but tantalizing glimpse into a world in which the visual novel's cute, nonsensical premise clashes with a serious, harsh reality. Even the idea of the Bells the cats wear -- the idea that catgirls can educate themselves in human culture in order to be more autonomous -- is fascinating, not the least because the idea's foundations rest on a very old English-language proverb with political connotations: ""bell the cat."" Think about it.  I'm a writer, not an artist, so I can't give any in-depth review of the art, but in my opinion, the character design is fine. Some of the secondary characters are a little too forgettable in their design, but the main characters are appealing enough. (My personal favorite is Vanilla.) I think the breast bouncing is a bit silly, but the animation during story scenes is often striking. And the animation in erotic scenes is quite good, indeed.  The music is all right. Some of the tracks wear a little thin after a while due to their short length, but others are quite evocative. Some of the sound effects are bad, and they're made even worse by how short they are and how frequently (and unnecessarily) they're looped. The licking/sucking sound effect in particular is irksome -- ugly, even. I would rather have just silence between lines of dialogue than [i]that[/i] particular sound effect.  The voice acting is good. You will likely find some characters more enjoyable to listen to than others, but for my part, I liked all of them. Chocola and Vanilla's voice actresses, of course, deserve particular note. They went above and beyond in recording erotic dialogue. I often found myself astounded by their voice acting.  I have high praise for the UI. It's simple, aesthetically-pleasing, and the configuration menu allows you to change a number of aspects about the game, which I appreciated.  [b]One final thing, and this is important:[/b] if you buy this game on Steam, note that [i]you are not getting the full version of the game[/i]. You are buying a version of the game which has apparently been heavily censored -- all the erotic scenes have been removed from it. I [i]strongly[/i] disapprove of that kind of censorship. [spoiler]Fortunately, there is an unofficial patch available on the patch18 website which (in my experience) allowed me to effortlessly restore the originally-intended content.[/spoiler]  I believe in the right of all artists to write, draw, and otherwise depict whatever they wish. And there are other erotic visual novels available for sale on Steam -- completely uncensored -- so why was this one subjected to such heavy-handed and needless censorship? I don't know the full story, but I can say this: if not for that patch, I would not be recommending this game. To me, it is unconscionable to sell only part of a product but market it as the whole. Perhaps this is Steam's fault. Perhaps it's the distributor's. I do not know.  Overall, I would say that [i]NEKOPARA[/i] is worth taking a look into if you're looking to play an interesting and sexy visual novel with fairly good dialogue. I would especially recommend taking a look at it if you are interested in, as I am, writing and developing erotic visual novels. It has many elements that it does well -- dialogue, voice acting, character design, animation -- and you could certainly do worse in finding games to guide and inspire your own work.",i have a lovehate relationship with visual novels i love the medium and its potential but the unfortunate truth is that the vast majority of them  even many popular ones  have downright execrable writing fortunately inekoparai does not  while inekoparai occasionally stumbles by including a few of the ty visual novelisms such as a bland protagonist not too bland thankfully characters who state the obvious though the game doesnt assume were dumb characters who announce their feelings you cant just have your characters announce how they feel that makes me feel angry and unnecessary flashbacks mercifully few and brief it is to my amazement wellwritten and intelligent for a visual novel and eroge  the dialogue is for the most part passable with occasional flashes of brilliance and poetic constructions  yes really there can rhythm and beauty in seemingly ordinary prose even in the gutter  and i have to admit that certain word choices really provided some muchneeded scratching of itches in addition the dialogue often made curious use of englishlanguage idioms which to my utter disbelief were not only used icorrectlyi but also used in evocative ways for that  the writers and translators for their work  you may find this hard to believe but there is some thoughtful and intriguing worldbuilding going on in the background of this silly little erotic visual novel the idea for instance that the catgirls will be arrested if they wander around on their own  that some catgirls have turned to crime to support themselves  provides a brief but tantalizing glimpse into a world in which the visual novels cute nonsensical premise clashes with a serious harsh reality even the idea of the bells the cats wear  the idea that catgirls can educate themselves in human culture in order to be more autonomous  is fascinating not the least because the ideas foundations rest on a very old englishlanguage proverb with political connotations bell the cat think about it  im a writer not an artist so i cant give any indepth review of the art but in my opinion the character design is fine some of the secondary characters are a little too forgettable in their design but the main characters are appealing enough my personal favorite is vanilla i think the breast bouncing is a bit silly but the animation during story scenes is often striking and the animation in erotic scenes is quite good indeed  the music is all right some of the tracks wear a little thin after a while due to their short length but others are quite evocative some of the sound effects are bad and theyre made even worse by how short they are and how frequently and unnecessarily theyre looped the lickingsucking sound effect in particular is irksome  ugly even i would rather have just silence between lines of dialogue than ithati particular sound effect  the voice acting is good you will likely find some characters more enjoyable to listen to than others but for my part i liked all of them chocola and vanillas voice actresses of course deserve particular note they went above and beyond in recording erotic dialogue i often found myself astounded by their voice acting  i have high praise for the ui its simple aestheticallypleasing and the configuration menu allows you to change a number of aspects about the game which i appreciated  bone final thing and this is importantb if you buy this game on steam note that iyou are not getting the full version of the gamei you are buying a version of the game which has apparently been heavily censored  all the erotic scenes have been removed from it i istronglyi disapprove of that kind of censorship spoilerfortunately there is an unofficial patch available on the patch18 website which in my experience allowed me to effortlessly restore the originallyintended contentspoiler  i believe in the right of all artists to write draw and otherwise depict whatever they wish and there are other erotic visual novels available for sale on steam  uncensored  so why was this one subjected to such heavyhanded and needless censorship i dont know the full story but i can say this if not for that patch i would not be  this game to me it is unconscionable to sell only part of a product but market it as the whole perhaps this is steams fault perhaps its the distributors i do not know  overall i would say that inekoparai is worth taking a look into if youre looking to play an interesting and sexy visual novel with fairly good dialogue i would especially  taking a look at it if you are interested in as i am writing and developing erotic visual novels it has many elements that it does well  dialogue voice acting character design animation  and you could certainly do worse in finding games to guide and inspire your own work,NEU,0.608586847782135

Let's be honest, the storyline here is as realistic as any other porn plot, but this game is actually pretty to look at, and really does require headphones, however, at the same time, it doesn't require any pants or lotion, because by the time something *does* happen, you're dripping with ""How are my cat girls going to give the owner a boner this time?"" if that's not a plus, then I don't know what is.

"I know these kind of games usually gather the funny styled reviews but I will try and give it a more serious one for people who are geniounly interested in Visual Novel titles (Hentai or not).   Let's start with the positives first. Everything in the game is well drawn and all characters during dialogues are animated giving it far more flair than most games of this genre which are usually consist of static images. The voice overs are decent (even though there is no choice for other languages other than Japanese), and the translators did a good job not butchering the script. Also if you apply the 18+ patch the sex scenes are well drawn and animated, so if you bought this game just for the porn aspect you will get your money's worth.    And those are all the positives of the game. Unfortunately the negatives outweight them by quite the margin. For start there are no choices to be made in the entirety of Nekopara. You just read the dialogues with no way to alter the story. And since I mentioned the story, basically there is none. It tries to tell a story of a world were humanoid cat girls exist and what is their place in the society but quickly it stops bothering. After the half hour mark it only cares about the sex and every conflict it tries to create is resolved in a couple of panels. Also, not only the game last around 2 hours it doesn't have multiple endings.   All in all, a well drawn Visual Novel with decent echhi scenes but nothing else. No decent story, no memorable characters, no multiple endings, extremely short. Get it only if you are into anime cat girls.",i know these kind of games usually gather the funny styled reviews but i will try and give it a more serious one for people who are geniounly interested in visual novel titles hentai or not   lets start with the positives first everything in the game is well drawn and all characters during dialogues are animated giving it far more flair than most games of this genre which are usually consist of static images the voice overs are decent even though there is no choice for other languages other than japanese and the translators did a good job not butchering the script also if you apply the 18 patch the sex scenes are well drawn and animated so if you bought this game just for the porn aspect you will get your moneys worth    and those are all the positives of the game unfortunately the negatives outweight them by quite the margin for start there are no choices to be made in the entirety of nekopara you just read the dialogues with no way to alter the story and since i mentioned the story basically there is none it tries to tell a story of a world were humanoid cat girls exist and what is their place in the society but quickly it stops bothering after the half hour mark it only cares about the sex and every conflict it tries to create is resolved in a couple of panels also not only the game last around 2 hours it doesnt have multiple endings   all in all a well drawn visual novel with decent echhi scenes but nothing else no decent story no memorable characters no multiple endings extremely short get it only if you are into anime cat girls,POS,0.8791525363922119

There are no choices to be had just plain ol’ reading/listening & a few vanilla sex scenes in the 18+ version, this is an Eroge not a Nukige, so the sex is not the aim of the game, one does not equal the other. It features only Japanese voice acting, a lot of it & for everyone but the MC. The story follows Kashou Minaduki, an aspiring baker who has recently moved away from his family for reasons to open up his own shop. Metal Gear Solid style our 2 main catgirls, Chocola & Vanilla, have snuck in inside of his moving boxes. After some back & forth they convince poor baker boy to let them stay.  Right out the bat I will say that the overarching story is a bit drab as this is an introductory game, though individual characters show some growth so it isn’t all that bad & has its funny as well as its share of sad moments.  The story is presented in the VN style of text boxes & sprites, though the sprites are animated using ‘E-mote’, a system akin to Live2D. It is pretty amazing seeing what would normally be plain static images come to life as they express themselves in various ways as they talk. This feature is also used on most of the sex scenes to great effect. Standard art is also used, with some chibi art used on comedic occasions & backgrounds fitting the overall style, which I appreciate. Music is decent with most of it being cheery stuff and a few somber tracks.  Option wise, it is also the standard VN affair for the most part, with sliders for sound volume, text box transparency, etc. The game features Chinese along with Japanese & English text, as mentioned voices will always be Japanese. You can customize the sound volume for each character along with extra voices. The ‘E-mote’ system allow for... chest bounciness (Press the ‘P’ on your keyboard, trust me) which you can customize with a slider too, though I must be blind since I didn’t see much change.  All in all, Neko Para Vol. 1 is a beautiful, but only ok storywise VN that would be of best value when purchased at a discount as the story was very tame & serving as more of stepping stone to the sequels. The art & usage of ‘E-mote’ to bring to life sprites is pretty amazing & something to be experienced & will definitely continue to experience as soon as I get my hands on the sequels. With a 3rd one in the works along with an anime OVA fans are sure to have plenty of NekoPara for a while to come.",nekopara vol 1 is an adult oriented though there is an allages version available vn featuring adorable catgirls and is the 1st of a series of 3 there are no choices to be had just plain ol readinglistening  a few vanilla sex scenes in the 18 version this is an eroge not a nukige so the sex is not the aim of the game one does not equal the other it features only japanese voice acting a lot of it  for everyone but the mc the story follows kashou minaduki an aspiring baker who has recently moved away from his family for reasons to open up his own shop metal gear solid style our 2 main catgirls chocola  vanilla have snuck in inside of his moving boxes after some back  forth they convince poor baker boy to let them stay  right out the bat i will say that the overarching story is a bit drab as this is an introductory game though individual characters show some growth so it isnt all that bad  has its funny as well as its share of sad moments  the story is presented in the vn style of text boxes  sprites though the sprites are animated using emote a system akin to live2d it is pretty amazing seeing what would normally be plain static  to life as they express themselves in various ways as they talk this feature is also used on most of the sex scenes to great effect standard art is also used with some chibi art used  occasions  backgrounds fitting the overall style which i appreciate music is decent with most of it being cheery stuff and a few somber tracks  option wise it is also the standard vn affair for the most part with sliders for sound volume text box transparency etc the game features chinese along with japanese  english text as mentioned voices will always be japanese you can customize the sound volume for each character along with extra voices the emote system allow for chest bounciness press the p on your keyboard trust me which you can customize with a slider too though i must be blind since i didnt see much change  all in all neko para vol 1 is a beautiful but only ok storywise vn that would be of best value when purchased at a discount as the story was very tame  serving as more of stepping stone to the sequels the art  usage of emote to bring to life sprites is pretty amazing  something to be experienced  will definitely continue to experience as soon as i get my hands on the sequels with a 3rd one in the works along with an anime ova fans are sure to have plenty of nekopara for a while,NEU,0.9066340327262878

"Note: I played the non-patched adult version, meaning no sexual content was shown or told, but time lapsed over.  I had to read these in short bursts, like a chapter each.  People kept implying it was a porn-game with the screenshots I kept seeing so wasn't interested in getting it. A friend gifted me this and Vol 0. I read vol 0 first and wrote a review for that then started reading this. (Vol 0 review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/385800 )  There's a lot of tear jerking moments that at times seems overwhelming or ubundent, or just drones on as filler that it gets annoying and want to move on. The characters you meet are unique in their own way. The animation for a VN seemed good. Voices... I guess were okay? Usually prefer english dub in Anime so... what do I know?  How the story ended left a sour taste in my mouth... felt it should've ended a few chapters sooner.  However... despite all that, I loved it. I was slowly warming up & understanding the characters and the world they lived in. My only constant irk was catgirls always refering to their owners as ""master""... I understand it's part of that world but just felt awkward, always, when they tell that to the guy you're viewing from that it feels like they're saying that to the reader directly.  There was suggestive themes that I didn't mind since it didn't get carried away or annoying, as they were either comical or romantic... however some parts were overly romantic that I wanted to throw up! (I'm not a romance person, obviously.)  This is a good read though. The story is actually interesting overall and the characters have their purpose in the story, regardless of how they were designed. This isn't a porn game, this is a story with minor adult themes but not focused on such things.  I have no interest in getting the 18+ or patch as I prefered, in this VN, to time lapse them and let me speculate what could happened on the after-math scene. Wouldn't feel comfortable to see such a thing with these characters.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url] Join and/or follow if you wish.",note i played the nonpatched adult version meaning no sexual content was shown or told but time lapsed over  i had to read these in short bursts like a chapter each  people kept implying it was a porngame with the screenshots i kept seeing so wasnt interested in getting it a friend gifted me this and vol 0 i read vol 0 first and wrote a review for that then started reading this vol 0 review here    theres a lot of tear jerking moments that at times seems overwhelming or ubundent or just drones on as filler that it gets annoying and want to move on the characters you meet are unique in their own way the animation for a vn seemed good voices i guess were okay usually prefer english dub in anime so what do i know  how the story ended left a sour taste in my mouth felt it shouldve ended a few chapters sooner  however despite all that i loved it i was slowly warming up  understanding the characters and the world they lived in my only constant irk was catgirls always refering to their owners as master i understand its part of that world but just felt awkward always when they tell that to the guy youre viewing from that it feels like theyre saying that to the reader directly  there was suggestive themes that i didnt mind since it didnt get carried away or annoying as they were  or romantic however some parts were overly romantic that i wanted to throw up im not a romance person obviously  this is a good read though the story is actually interesting overall and the characters have their purpose in the story regardless of how they were designed this isnt a porn game this is a story with minor adult themes but not focused on such things  i have no interest in getting the 18 or patch as i prefered in this vn to time lapse them and let me speculate what could happened on the aftermath scene wouldnt  to see such a thing with these characters    check out more games i see that deserve more attention from my curator group  underrated games listurl join andor follow if you wish,NEG,0.6726977825164795

"According to all known laws of aviation,     there is no way a bee should be able to fly.     Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anywayy     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

"In consideration of the ageing population of Japan, it is a relief to find that there are still young members of the workforce who are able to take the next step forward in small business ownership.   NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a visual novel that deals with the startup and establishment of a small business in the local economy. While not so much touching on the subject of financing and legal procedure associated with new entrepreneurship, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 does delve into the issues associated with human resource management particularly those of the interpersonal relationships between employees and employer. As with any SME (small and medium enterprises), delegation has long been an issue in the first few years of ownership. In fact, inefficient assignment of responsibilities is a major cause of business failure.   NEKOPARA Vol. 1 follows a young business owner in Japan as he works through the bumps and kinks faced by new business owners. It touches on subjects related to the securing and development of human resources which in turn leads to the promotion of organizational growth. Subjects such as: - pampering your kawaii neko-chan employees through intimate skinship - sleeping with those same neko-chan employees to indulge their lust as they sexually mature - acquiring the most kawaii desu attire for your neko-chans to wear to satisfy your filthy maid fetish - appease your imouto-chan who calls you up every second day to get off to your alpha male-testosterone filled voice - baking cakes.

"I really want to make a serious review on this title as I actually quite enjoyed it not because of the mature parts, but more so for the art and music.  Got this game when it went on sale as I wanted to try and see what the appeal of visual novels were and why there were so many on Steam. My reasoning for choosing this one is actually pretty simple: it's very colorful and the characters all have glass-shine eyes which I really adore. Anime in general always inspires me to be creative whether it be art or writing.  Anyway, the story itself is not bad. It's a simple story of a guy wanting to start a life of his own only to have to deal with his catgirls which are considered pets. If I recall correctly, they're not Humans made into Cats, but the other way around which kind of gives me some moral issues. That's just me, but each their own.  Each character is a stereotype of some kind. Chocola's an airhead, Vanilla is calm-minded but always goes to the extremes, etc. About halfway through, I actually stopped caring about any of them apart from Vanilla who at least stayed consistent enough to not have me smash my face against my desk. There's one minor arc in here that I made me sad which I won't spoil here.   Music in this game is fantastic, each track sets a perfect mood for the scene even if it's cliche as hell. Art, as I said before, is really beatiful and very well done. For me it was worth the price I paid which I think was $8. As for the suggestive scene(?) it's not really that bad. Definitely want to make sure nobody is around, though.  Also, I want to gripe about this because there is absolutely [b]NO REASON[/b] for this, why the hell are there 10 pages of save slots? Also, deleting them corrupts the file so if you accidentally saved, I don't know of a fix right now other than probably a fresh install. Back to the point, no visual novel, I don't care how long, does not need 170 save slots even if I were to save at every single scene.

Be wary though, because the animations in this VN is quite taxing on your CPU/GPU (It might not be the case on your PC, but it's a little too heavy on my netbook). Also, make sure to set your [u]mipmap quality[/u] setting for this game in your GPU control panel to [u]""High Quality""[/u], since setting it to ""Performance/Low Quality"" will make the characters in animated scenes blurry.

Also there's no different conversation choices and ending for this VN, but you're going to see catgirls anyway, so i won't worry too much about that part.

"The world of NEKOPARA sounds interesting enough. At some point, genetic engineering has progressed to the point where catgirls are available as pets, companions, and whatnot. Nowadays, there are less stray catgirls, and there are hints of problems with some involved in criminal activity. To combat this problem, catgirls with owners can have their pets take an exam to get a Bell collar that allows them to be monitored and walk in public by themselves.   Unfortunately for those who like visual novels with serious storylines, this is not one. Kashou leaves his strict household to open a Western-style bakery. However, two of his family's cats, Chocola and Vanilla, follow him, and refuse to leave. He ends up hiring them, and light, fluffy, slice of life romance ensues. Made somewhat awkward by his initial impression of the two as daughters, the romance is pretty much tacked on.  Thankfully, the ero scenes have been removed from the Steam release.  However, as someone who loves cats, there are some interesting questions that just don't get any answers. Catgirls, despite their humanoid appearance, age at the same rate as real cats. People refer to treating their catgirls as their children. There's a bit of fridge horror in that question. Catgirls seem to be genetically engineered to be sterile, presumably to save them the trauma of a surgery. The criminal element is not explained, though for some reason, catgirls stealing people's food, knocking things over, and causing trouble by climbing tall things comes to mind.   So do I recommend this game? That depends on the player, really. Too bad there's not a 'so-so' button. Despite that, I want to see how Kashou and his cat family do running the bakery. I'm actually curious about the background of this world. Will I like what I find?

"Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture.  There are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions. Bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular, commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing.  Depending on local custom and convenience, bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day. It also is eaten as a snack, or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking, or the bland main component of a bread pudding, or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away.  Partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff, bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition; it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions (""He stole the bread from my mouth""), in prayer (""Give us this day our daily bread"") and even in the etymology of words, such as ""companion"" and ""company"" (literally those who eat/share bread with you).

It may be connected with the root of break, for its early uses are confined to broken pieces or bits of bread, the Latin crustum, and it was not until the 12th century that it took the place—as the generic name for bread—of hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern English loaf), which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name.[1] Old High German hleib[2] and modern German Laib derive from this Proto-Germanic word for ""loaf"", which was borrowed into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (Finnish leipä, Estonian leib) languages as well.  In many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a ""bread-winner"" is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase ""putting bread on the table"". The Roman poet Juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses). In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised ""peace, land, and bread.""[3][4] The term ""breadbasket"" denotes an agriculturally productive region. In Slavic cultures bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests. In India, life's basic necessities are often referred to as ""roti, kapra aur makan"" (bread, cloth, and house). In Israel, the most usual phrase in work-related demonstrations is lekhem, avoda (""bread, work"").  The word bread is commonly used around the world in English-speaking countries as a synonym for money[1] (as is the case with the word ""dough""). A remarkable or revolutionary innovation is often referred to in North America and the United Kingdom as ""the greatest thing since sliced bread"" or ""the best thing since sliced bread"". In Cockney rhyming slang, bread means money; this usage is derived from the phrase ""bread and honey"".[5]  History Main article: History of bread  Bread shop, Tacuinum Sanitatis from Northern Italy, beginning of the 15th century Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.[6] It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened.[7]  There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce ""a lighter kind of bread than other peoples."" Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter.[8]  In 1961 the Chorleywood bread process was developed, which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.[9]  Recently, domestic bread machines that automate the process of making bread have become popular.  Types  White bread (left) and brown bread. See also: List of breads Bread is the staple food of the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa, in contrast to East Asia where rice is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread.  Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum, spelt and emmer), rye, barley, maize (corn), and oats, usually, but not always, in combination with wheat flour. Spelt bread (Dinkelbrot) continues to be widely consumed in Germany, and emmer bread was a staple food in ancient Egypt. Canadian bread is known for its heartier consistency due to high protein levels in Canadian flour.  Pita is an ancient semi-leavened bread widespread in the Middle East, Levant and South Eastern Europe. White bread is made from flour containing only the central core(endosperm). Brown bread is made with endosperm and 10% bran. It can also refer to white bread with added coloring (often caramel) to make it brown",bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water usually by baking throughout recorded history it

"NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a great game, theres are countless hours of fun and there are a lot of aspects to if that a similar game league of legends is lacking.  1. The workshop, this is where the community really has its biggest aspect on the game, most of the items put into NEKOPARA Vol. 1 come out of the workshop and community artists that are dedicated to their work! 3. Unlike League of legends, all the catgirls in NEKOPARA Vol. 1 are unlocked when you start the game, giving the game a total different aspect and feel. 4. The catgirl pool is very big and very diverse, all the catgirls have differing abilities and there are multiple catgirls for everyone. 5. The catgirls looks beautiful - I personally prefer NEKOPARA Vol. 1 graphics and they way the catgirl  is layed out far more than that of League of legends, I just think its a smarter design. 6. It is usable through steam - My biggest complaint with LoL was that I couldn't play it through steam, but NEKOPARA Vol. 1 solves those problems. 7. If you have a full party or at least 3, the game can be super fun - I think this game is way better with friends, as it adds a whole new aspect to the game. You can show off your gaming skills and honestly have better gameplay with friends, as you know you will be able to communicate with them and pet catgirls much bettter than if you were playing with a bunch of randoms.  There are many more pros but those were just a couple i wanted to say. however there are downsides to NEKOPARA Vol. 1.  1. The community, many members of the community are hostile, or dont communicate or just cant understand you, For example, when I try to que in US West, half the time my team mates are from mexico or just dont speak any japanese. Than you get the people who just mic spam for no reason. 2. It can be really hard to get a match sometimes because of the people who take forever to accept or the people who dont load into the game. I have had times where my games have failed up to 6 times in a row! 3. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 Reborn. For people who may have played the game previously and stopped for a while, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn may be a shock. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn was pretty unecessary and has made the game much more confusing than it needs to be. With NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn they are trying to make NEKOPARA look like a much more fancy game than the old loading screen stuff did before, but instead has just made everything more confusing. It will take them a while to work out all the kinks but I think in the end they will work it out.  This is one of my favorite games, it is up there with the likes of Counter Strike - Global Offensive as my top all time most played games, also, living in the NorthWest region, I did get the chance to attend the Sakura-Con, which was one of the best Experiences of my life and would recommend it to anyone interested in going.",nekopara vol 1 is a great game theres are countless hours of fun and there are a lot of aspects to if that a similar game league of legends is lacking  1 the workshop this is where  really has its biggest aspect on the game most of the items put into nekopara vol  out of the workshop  artists that are dedicated to their work 3 unlike league of legends all the catgirls in nekopara vol 1 are unlocked when you start the game giving the game a total different aspect and feel 4 the catgirl pool is very big and very diverse all the catgirls have differing abilities and there are multiple catgirls for everyone 5 the catgirls looks beautiful  i personally prefer nekopara vol 1 graphics and they way the catgirl  is layed out far more than that of league of legends i just think its a smarter design 6 it is usable through steam  my  with lol was that i couldnt play it through steam but nekopara vol 1 solves those problems 7 if you have a full party or at least 3 the game can be super fun  i think this game is way better with friends as it adds a whole new aspect to the game you can show off your gaming skills and honestly have better gameplay with friends as you know you will be able  with them and pet catgirls much bettter than if you were playing with a bunch of randoms  there are many more pros but those were just a couple i wanted to say however there are downsides to nekopara vol 1  1  many members of  are hostile or  or just cant understand you for example when i try to que in us west half the time my team mates are from mexico or just dont speak any japanese than you get the people who just mic spam for no reason 2 it can be really hard to get a match sometimes because of the people who take forever to accept or the people who dont load into the game i have had times where my games have failed up to 6 times in a row 3 nekopara vol 1 reborn for people who may have played the game previously and stopped for a while nekopara vol 1 reborn may be a shock nekopara vol 1 reborn was pretty unecessary and has made the game much more confusing than it needs to be with nekopara vol 1 reborn they are trying to make nekopara look like a much more fancy game than the old loading screen stuff did before but instead has just made everything more confusing it will take them a while to work out all the kinks but i think in the end they will work it out  this is one of my favorite games it is up there with the likes of counter strike  global offensive as my top all time most played games also living in the northwest region i did get the chance to attend the sakuracon which was one of the best experiences of my life and would  it to anyone interested in going,POS,0.9811583757400513

"Characters: 6.5/10  The main character is relatable, and his role seems to be something of a bastion of reliability, and, well... normalcy. His sister, although quite quirky, is also well written. The two main catgirls, by contrast, often behave instinctually, and can be unpredictable. To be honest I found their characters a little exaggerated at times, and difficult to engage with.  Story: 6/10  The story is long, but slow. Character develop and plot development happen in relatively discrete steps, rather than a gradual progression, which for me made immersion difficult. The development of relationships between the characters similarly seemed a little difficult to credit. The story reads like a chapter-based fairy tale or sorts. The fantastic nature of it is good, but it lacks the kind of interal consitency and attention to detail that make other stories believable.  Visuals: 7/10  The artwork is quite nice. Animation is basic. If you have a particular interest in catgirls in maid outfits, or the loli aesthetic (ribbons, bows, lace etc.), it may take your fancy.  Sound: 6.5/10  Voice acting is good. A few nice soundtracks as a backing to the story.  Overall score: 6.5/10  As a visual novel, this story just doesn't have quite enough going for it for me to recommend it.  It's worth noting here that while there is a mature content patch available for this game, it's not the product being sold here on Steam, and as such it's not what I'm basing my review on.",characters 6510  the main character is relatable and his role seems to be something of a bastion of reliability and well normalcy his sister although quite quirky is also well written the two main catgirls by contrast often behave instinctually and can be unpredictable to be honest i found their characters a little exaggerated at times and difficult to engage with  story 610  the story is long but slow character develop and plot development happen in relatively discrete steps rather than a gradual progression which for me made immersion difficult the development of relationships between the characters similarly seemed a little difficult to credit the story reads like a chapterbased fairy tale or sorts the fantastic nature of it is good but it lacks the kind of interal consitency and attention to detail that make other stories believable  visuals 710  the artwork is quite nice animation is basic if you have a particular interest in catgirls in maid outfits or the loli aesthetic ribbons bows lace etc it may take your fancy  sound 6510  voice acting is good a few nice soundtracks as a backing to the story  overall score 6510  as a visual novel this story just doesnt have quite enough going for it for me to  it  its worth noting here that while there is a mature content patch available for this game its not the product being sold here on steam and as such its not what im basing my review on,NEU,0.8419837355613708

"As far as erotica goes NEKOPARA is on about the same level as stuff you can find for free. There's no real gameplay, so the achievements are pointless. Thanks to Steam's ban on adult content you can't even get the full package unless you resort to an unofficial patch, so if you are interested you need to make sure that's still available before you even consider purchasing.  The only reason someone might have to pay for this is the art and the voice acting. Unfortunately, the art and voice acting are in support of a dumb harem-style adventure. The plot is over-written at times and the main character is a jackass. Not the worst jackass I've ever had the displeasure of reading (the male protagonist isn't voice-acted), but still annoying. He's also kinda condescending, but considering he's basically a slave owner that's to be expected.  The weird cat-girl slave-race thing is both omnipresent and ignored, like in most pretend-monsterworld-japanese-fantasy-things. Some of the issues that might result from having to share society with less-intelligent genetically-modified human-like creatures is almost touched upon at times and swiftly discarded, because no one wants to go there even if it's hard not to wonder at the twisted possibilities the writing skirts. They make it clear that humans can't breed with cat girls, say nothing about cat boys, and leave the player to fap.  Not worth paying for unless it's heavily discounted or your really into stupid sappy hentai plots and meaningless achievements. Or, if you don't care about buying actual games on Steam. I'm still hoping there's a failure state in here somewhere :(",as far as erotica goes nekopara is on about the same level as stuff you can find for free theres no real gameplay so the achievements are pointless thanks to steams ban on adult content you cant even get the full package unless you resort to an unofficial patch so if you are interested you need to make sure thats still available before you even consider purchasing  the only reason someone might have to pay for this is the art and the voice acting unfortunately the art and voice acting are in support of a dumb haremstyle adventure the plot is overwritten at times and the main character is a jackass not the worst jackass ive ever had the displeasure of reading the male protagonist isnt voiceacted but still annoying hes also kinda condescending but considering hes basically a slave owner thats to be expected  the weird catgirl slaverace thing is both omnipresent and ignored like in most pretendmonsterworldjapanesefantasythings some of the issues that might result from having to share society with lessintelligent  humanlike creatures is almost touched upon at times and swiftly discarded because no one wants to go there even if its hard not to wonder at the twisted possibilities the writing skirts they make it clear that humans cant breed with cat girls say nothing about cat boys and leave the player to fap  not worth paying for unless its heavily discounted or your really into stupid sappy hentai plots and meaningless achievements or if you dont care about buying actual games on steam im still hoping theres a failure state in here somewhere,NEG,0.9297196865081787

"[h1]Short Review[/h1] NEKOPARA is one of the best VN's available on Steam right now. You play as a startup cafe owner joined by two catgirls. The story is a slice of life revolving around these three main characters with a few cameos from your sister and the rest of the catgirl bunch. The character development and voice acting are well done.  From a VN standpoint, NEKOPARA utilizes great animations and a full voice cast (besides yourself). The layout is clean and a few game features, such as: repeat voice dialogue, CG/scene/movie viewer, text speed, menu opacity etc., sets this VN above other generic pieces.   Also fyi, the Steam version of this game is censored. There are many guides out there on how to unofficially patch it to the uncensored R-18 version.

"Well having just finished this game I think it's time to write my review Alright so obviously if you're purchasing this game, the only thing you legitimately care about is shagging these (probably underage) Cat girls. The first sex scene comes up at around the middle point of the game. Before that, there's allot of story which ended up negatively impacting my sexy time experience. Why is this you may ask? Simply put, the story and dialogue made me go from seeing these girls as nothing more than sexual objects for me to unleash my heavy load into, to seeing them more as my own daughters. So therefore, when it came to the sex scenes, i felt like I was nailing my own daughters which btw, I'm not fond of since i'm not american. The second sex scene comes at the end of the game and then thats it. They're alright I guess but they're kind of boring. If you're buying this game just for the hentai (so basically, if you're buying the game) You're probably better off just looking for the naughty pictures online and having a five knuckle shuffle over these girls that you have no connection to, rather than growing attached to them and then feeling like you're breaking 57 laws by destroying the insides of your daughters.  OVERALL: This game is worthless without the hentai patch and even with it, it's still not that good. I only purchased because it was on sale for like 80% off. Had I known how less than average this game would have been, I'm not sure I would have even bought it for a price even that low. Basically, If its the sex scenes you're looking for, just find them online. If it's the story you're interested in, Don't bother, it's garbage. If you're looking to unleash every drop of your juices in girls who are basically your daughters, then this game is a must have!",well having just finished this game i think its time to write my review alright so obviously if youre purchasing this game the only thing you legitimately care about is shagging these probably underage cat girls the first sex  up at around the middle point of the game before that theres allot of story which ended up negatively impacting my sexy time experience why is this you may ask simply put the story and dialogue made me go from seeing these girls as nothing more than sexual objects for me to unleash my heavy load into to seeing them more as my own daughters so therefore when it came to the sex scenes i felt like i was nailing my own daughters which btw im not fond of since im not american the second sex  at the end of the game and then thats it theyre alright i guess but theyre kind of boring if youre buying this game just for the hentai so basically if youre buying the game youre probably better off just looking for the naughty  online and having a five knuckle shuffle over these girls that you have no connection to rather than growing attached to them and then feeling like youre breaking 57 laws by destroying the insides of your daughters  overall this game is worthless without the hentai patch and even with it its still not that good i only purchased because it was on sale for like 80 off had i known how less than average this game would have been im not sure i would have even bought it for a price even that low basically if its the sex scenes youre looking for just find them online if its the story youre interested in dont bother its garbage if youre looking to unleash every drop of your juices in girls who are basically your daughters then this game is a must have,NEG,0.5889825820922852

"Nekopara is one of those feel good games (and I'm not just talking about the sex). The plot is very basic, so it's more about the interactions and conversations the main character has with the cat girls. Every moment is an opportunity for the cat girls to act cute, say cute things, and do cute things.  The graphics are beyond par for this type of game, with incredibly beautiful visuals and details, and impressively animated using Live2D. The vast array of gorgeously frilly lolita inspired clothing will make you constantly fawn over how adorable Chocola and Vanilla look. The character voices are also very good. It's a bit on the trope-y side, but it helps tying it all together in a comfortable familiarity. You'll quickly find your favorite character.  Since this is the first volume, a fair bit of the first few chapters deals with setting the stage, and introducing you to the personalities of all the characters. The ""plot"" doesn't really ""pick up"" until about half-way through.  One thing I do like about this particular game is the small attention to detail that they've designed. Things like automatically moving the mouse cursor to the center when selecting yes/no for loading/saving. The user interface is intuitive, and the colors are welcoming.  In terms of gameplay, there really is none. It's a non-interactive, visual novel. Don't expect more than that. That's not to say it's a bad thing. It's just to be expected for this kind of game.  If you're thinking about purchasing this game for the sex, you will be disappointed to know that Steam has made the developer completely cut the sexual content. And relatively speaking, that's about 40% of the game! Fortunately, if you google it, you can find an easy to install patch that will restore all the content.

"[h1]An actual serious review[/h1] This is the first visual novel purchased I've purchased on steam. The VN itself is very well presented (good VA, music, art). It should be noted that his release is toned down (i.e., H-related content was removed).  [b]What I liked[/b] - Music and Art - Characters are nicely constructed and their VAs are great. - Story was decent. There's not too much exposition which would pull you out of the flow of the story.  [b]What I disliked[/b] - Not a fan of the ""imouto"" which is almost oppresive with one of the characters. Just not my thing. - Maximum in-game resolution was 1600x900.  [b]Other notes[/b] - I quite enjoyed going through this VN. I'm very tempted to pick up Vol. 2 when it goes on sale.  - Vol. 1 is a passive VN. You just go from one panel to the next with no interaction with the content on-screen. Vol.0 and Vol. 2 are more interactive.  - VA is Japanese only.  - The eroge content has been removed, which requires [b]re-purchasing[/b] the game from the developer at it's true full price to obtain.

"What in the Oblivion Steam? When I heard this game has sex cut from it I expected something like Playstation 2 port of Fate Stay Night (excellent VN, play it), where they removed sex completely, and replaced sex scenes with apropriate scenes (storywise), and here we get: ""Oh they do have sex, no you're not getting to watch it, you could get traumatized."" treatment... OK, I understand that it's actually loli, so I guess there are some issues with showing them, but at the same time it's clearly shown they do get in action, so it's kinda useless censoring it (playing kinetic novel centered on relationship progress with sex clearly happening, but not shown, is like watching soccer game with every goal not being shown). Especially taking into account how Nekopara was created (I mean Vanilla and Chocola as characters).  Which takes me to other point. Why is it not OK to show sex on steam, but it's OK to show dismemberment, gore, mutilation, etc...

"NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a phenomenal game; it's respectively one of the most popular visual novels on Steam. Though the main story-line of the game is fairly average without much action, it still manages to keep the user entranced in the game. What it lacks in action, it makes up for in character development; this resaulting in the adoration of the main characters (Chocola and Vanilla).  I highly recommend NEKOPARA Vol. 1 to anyone interested in visual novels. However, if you've only come for the NSFW content NEKOPARA is rumored to contain, I'm afraid you won't find that here. The Steam version of the NEKOPARA series is the non-NSFW version.  I'd also recommend checking out NEKOPARA Vol. 0 for some insight to the story-line and characters of the game.

"First of All, for those who doesn't know this is ""STEAM CENSORED"" version, which mean there is no S** Scene in it  On to the Review  The game is pretty straight forward, you don't need to do anything but click through the story (LITERALLY, there is even an auto play feature to save you all the problem of clicking your mouse).  Pros :  The art are pretty nice and smooth, it pretty and will satisfy any otaku,anime, and cat lovers. The story is short but still heart warming.  Cons :  It really doesn't have much difference from other VN games, which is a shame cause it has potential to be a bit more original in the story, and this game has LITERALLY 1 path and 1 ending, there are no choices need to be made during the whole gameplay, you only need to keep clicking and move along with the story, which is a real shame that made this game has no replay value whatsoever, considering the short story of the game itself, and for the price tag, its not really worth buying if your not really into the VN game genre or cat girls  Overall, i think this game is really good (even though considering the cons are longer than the pros) for those who love VN games in general, it has almost has everything you wanted from a VN. The cute and loveable character combined with a heart warming story makes up for it lacks of replay value and choices within the game. as for the price it self, its maybe a litte bit too expensive considering you only have 1 story line to play, but the beauty of the art within the game is pretty much worthwhile, especially for those who love VN games",first of all for those who doesnt know this is steam censored version which mean there is no s scene in it  on to the review  the game is pretty straight forward you dont need to do anything but click through the story literally there is even an auto play feature to save you all the problem of clicking your mouse  pros   the art are pretty nice and smooth it pretty and will satisfy any otakuanime and cat lovers the story is short but still heart warming  cons   it really doesnt have much difference from other vn games which is a shame cause it has potential to be a bit more original in the story and this game has literally 1 path and 1 ending there are no choices need to be made during the whole gameplay you only need to keep clicking and move along with the story which is a real shame that made this game has no replay value whatsoever considering the short story of the game itself and for the price tag its not really worth buying if your not really into the vn game genre or cat girls  overall i think this game is really good even though considering the cons are longer than the pros for those who love vn games in general it has almost has everything you wanted from a vn the cute and loveable  with a heart warming story makes up for it lacks of replay value and choices within the game as for the price it self its maybe a litte bit too expensive considering you only have 1 story line to play but the beauty of the art within the game is pretty much worthwhile especially for those who love vn games,NEU,0.7684574723243713

Even that content is aquite good to other Eroge I have played. Vol 0 is great as well and reccomended. You meet the other catgirls in it, and just a personal note, I love Maple. There are problems, but they are few in number. There is never really a good spot to stop playing, so I suggest playing in 1-2 sittings, as close together as possible, to get the best result.

"Well it took me a few days on and off to finish this game and all of my issues with nekopara volume 0 were resolved in this version. I was happy to see the story was MUCH longer and that really annoying walk is very limited in this version which I was happy about. The story was interesting when I first started I didn't expect the story to go the way it did but even with that being said I enjoyed the story. It had a lot of comedy to the story so that made for an amusing read.  I wish the game had a bit more interaction maybe a story branch but even then I can say it wasn't bad.

"A short kenetic visual novel. Overall it is not a bad game.  Why not recommended then? Simply because there is really only one single reason to play this game. That being to look at very nicely drawn pictures of catgirls. Apart from that there is really nothing here. So if that is something you would enjoy, by all means go ahead and play. If you are wanting something a little more substantial in terms of content though, there is really nothing here.  The story plays out sort of like a 4-koma. In that there are chapters, but these are further divided into several short vignettes. It is basically a slice-of-life story about a man opening a bakery and training two catgirl staff. In a relationship that later becomes sexual in nature. And yes even this Steam version makes certain you know you are missing sex scenes, they just show the before and after.  I think if this game were a comedy, it would have turned out really great. The style would have fit a comedy really well. But this is unfortunately not a comedy. For such a rediculous background story and world, the game is remarkably terse and serious in tone. There is some situational stuff and jokes, but nothing consistant enough to make the reader have fun. In that sense taking this solely as a story, it is fairly generic and boring. It is just cute girls doing cute things, that personally isn't really enough to carry it.  The main saving grace is that it is short. If it were longer than the 2-4 hours it is, it would have outstayed its welcome being as simple as it is. That said the value for money at $10 seems a little lacking because of that. Vol. 2 really will have to do something to change up the situation a little.

"My overall rating for NEKOPARA Vol. 1: 80/100  This is a game, that does not have to be taken seriously. Or has to? This visual novel is a lovely, relaxing game, where you can find both amusement, but also deep ideas about love, friendship, loyalty and things, that accompany us in our lives. Let's see this in detail  GAMEPLAY  + Decent animations + Format + Chapter selection o Some anime clichés   I absolutely love playing this game. It is true, that I picked it as some not-so-serious game, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story is simple - the hero, Kaishou Minaduki, is opening a bakery and his two most loyal catgirls are coming to join him.  The Visual Novel format suits this game well, you are progressing through chapters and revealing the destiny of not only Kaishou and his two Catgirls - Chocola and Vanilla, but also support from his sister Shigure and the rest of Minaduki's family Catgirls - Azuki, Cinnamon, Coconut and Maple. Present times are switching with memories in the right time, so the player will not get bored.  Also setting of Catgirls role in society was interesting, many procedures are similar to our in our lives (getting of personal identification card is a metaphore to Bell exam etc.).  Only what bothered me, were some anime clichés, like to much boob shaking (I know this will bring negative points for this review :-D ), but besied that, I liked, how this novel was able to change from completely funny, to very serious and vice versa.  CHARACTERS  + Chocolla + Vanilla + Kaishou + Shigure + Steam cards, backgrounds, emoticons o Azuki, Cinnamon, Coconut, Maple  Also characters shown a variety of personalities. Kaishou is on a big crossroad of his life, full of both hopes and worries. Chocolla is a typical extrovertial person, on the opposite, Vanilla is an introvert. All of this characters are transforming, they are becoming more responsible, feeling how it is to be in love and get closer to someone.  Setting of characters is brilliant, both Chocolla and Vanilla are at the age of the first love, filled with innocence and romantic dreams. Many things are shown metaphorically, but they suit their needs.  Shigure is also important, as a younger sister she looks up to Kaishou, but also gives him important advices. The rest of Minaduki's Catgirls were just an addition, game could be also good without them, but they were not something disturbing.  Also extras as Steam Cards, backgrounds and emoticons are nice and lovely, one of few games with that accesories.  SOUNDTRACK  + Lovely according to the atmosphere + Music player + Interjections  I liked the soundtrack, it was suited for not only funny and smiling moments, but also for serious times and thoughts. Very satisfying, also as the presence of music, movie player and gallery of most conmemorable moments.  Onomatopoeia is a very important part of Japanese games and here it was used perfectly. I did not know, that so many sounds and activities can be pictured in this way!  VISUALS  + Perfect, lovely  There is nothing to complain here about, everything was right as it should be. Animy style is a bit close to Shoujo manga, but it is not overfilled with sweetness. Just several clichés, mentioned above.  SUMMARY  NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a game that should get its chance to be played. I have to say, that you need a specific mood for playing, and when you have it, the story will catch you to the very end (I finished it in two days :-D ).   I think this game should deserve a higher score, but it is suitable mostly for genre fans and most player out of it, can see this game as childish and disturbing. That is why I have chosen this evaluation.  Anyway, it is perfect and worth to try. Catgirls paradise!  PS: There is a mature version, but I have not tried it. If you would, I will not stop you, but I do not think it is necessary to spoil the nice metaphores of the game. I leave it up to you.",my overall rating for nekopara vol 1 80100  this is a game that does not have to be taken seriously or has to this visual novel is a lovely relaxing game where you can find both amusement but also deep ideas about love friendship loyalty and things that  us in our lives lets see this in detail  gameplay   decent animations  format  chapter selection o some anime clichés   i absolutely love playing this game it is true that i  it as some notsoserious game but i was pleasantly surprised the story is simple  the hero kaishou minaduki is opening a bakery and his two most loyal catgirls  to join him  the visual novel format suits this game well you are progressing through chapters and revealing the destiny of not only kaishou and his two catgirls  chocola and vanilla but also support from his sister shigure and the rest of minadukis family catgirls  azuki cinnamon coconut and maple present times are switching with memories in the right time so the player will not get bored  also setting of catgirls role in society was interesting many procedures are similar to our in our lives getting of personal identification card is a metaphore to bell exam etc  only what bothered me were some anime clichés like to much boob shaking i know this will bring negative points for this review d  but besied that i liked how this novel was able to change  funny to very serious and vice versa  characters   chocolla  vanilla  kaishou  shigure  steam cards backgrounds emoticons o azuki cinnamon coconut maple  also characters shown a variety of personalities kaishou is on a big crossroad of his life full of both hopes and worries chocolla is a ty extrovertial person on the opposite vanilla is an introvert all of this characters are transforming they are  more responsible feeling how it is to be in love and get closer to someone  setting of characters is brilliant both chocolla and vanilla are at the age of the first love filled with innocence and romantic dreams many things are shown metaphorically but they suit their needs  shigure is also important as a younger sister she looks up to kaishou but also gives him important advices the rest of minadukis catgirls were just an addition game could be also good without them but they were not something disturbing  also extras as steam cards backgrounds and emoticons are nice and lovely one of few games with that accesories  soundtrack   lovely according to the atmosphere  music player  interjections  i liked the soundtrack it was suited for not only funny and smiling moments but also for serious times and thoughts very satisfying also as the presence of music movie player and gallery of most conmemorable moments  onomatopoeia is a very important part of japanese games and here it was used perfectly i did not know that so many sounds and activities can be  in this way  visuals   perfect lovely  there is nothing  here about everything was right as it should be animy style is a bit close to shoujo manga but it is not overfilled with sweetness just several clichés mentioned above  summary  nekopara vol 1 is a game that should get its chance to be played i have to say that you need a specific mood for playing and when you have it the story will catch you to the very end i finished it in two days d    i think this game should deserve a higher score but it is suitable mostly for genre fans and most player out of it can see this game as childish and disturbing that is why i have chosen this evaluation  anyway it is perfect and worth to try catgirls paradise  ps there is a mature version but i have not tried it if you would i will not stop you but i do not think it is necessary to spoil the nice metaphores of the game i leave it up to you,POS,0.9687135815620422

"Let's do a review without all the jokes here, hm? Nekopara is a fantastic visual novel, both in appearance, and in features. With Steam starting to take a shine to allowing Visual Novels, we're getting a lot of them recently, and it's hard to know what to look for. In Nekopara's case, it's lighthearted fun, certainly a bit perverse, but never takes itself too seriously or goes into an awkward zone that makes you feel uncomfortable.  Sure it's catgirls, but this series knows it's not to be taken seriously, and it knows it's very heavily anime styled, and they don't hold back. There are moments characters get chibi styled, the eyes show silly, emote style expressions, and they really feel very fresh, lively, and amusing all at once.  Characters as shown in the vids feel alive, as they are always moving a bit along the screen. Whether it's their eyes trailing from one side to another or pupils shrinking, it's them bouncing about and getting active, changing perspective, ears perking or drooping, or even the 'chest bounce' or so, the characters are very smoothly done. It doesn't change from panel to panel and sprite to sprite, instead it's animated, and it really feels like they're a bit more lively than your normal visual novel.  As for settings, there are some fantastic touches that make this game so easy to manage. The usual quicksave and quickload is there, but you can add 'notes' to these and your regular saves to really know exactly where you left off. The sliders allow text speed for normal and auto, window transparency, even individual voice volumes per character, music volume, sfx, and just voice in general, really giving you a lot of ways to adjust it and make yourself comfortable with the game.  The english translation is fantastically done, and the series is presented in 'chapters' with even a fantastic intro after chapter 1 that made it feel like a legit anime. Each character is very different, and while it seems to focus a bit more on two in particular, every character gets a lot of love and spotlight.  Overall, I've always been a huge fan of visual novels, from the really deep stories, to sometimes a fun and lighthearted one, and sometimes a few are forgotten or just aren't worth completeing. Nekopara though is not one that will fade away from my mind any time soon, and is worth the playthrough. Great sound, fantastic voicing, beautiful animation, user friendly, and just silly, fun, and adorable ride worth taking.",lets do a review without all the jokes here hm nekopara is a fantastic visual novel both in appearance and in features with steam starting to take a shine to allowing visual novels were getting a lot of them recently and its hard to know what to look for in nekoparas case its lighthearted fun certainly a bit perverse but never takes itself too seriously or goes into an awkward zone that makes you feel   sure its catgirls but this series knows its not to be taken seriously and it knows its very heavily anime styled and they dont hold back there are moments characters get chibi styled the eyes show silly emote style expressions and they really feel very fresh lively and amusing all at once  characters as shown in the vids feel alive as they are always moving a bit along the screen whether its their eyes trailing from one side to another or pupils shrinking its them bouncing about and getting active changing perspective ears perking or drooping or even the chest bounce or so the characters are very smoothly done it doesnt change from panel to panel and sprite to sprite instead its animated and it really feels like theyre a bit more lively than your normal visual novel  as for settings there are some fantastic touches that make this game so easy to manage the usual quicksave and quickload is there but you can add notes to these and your regular saves to really know exactly where you left off the sliders allow text speed for normal and auto window transparency even individual voice volumes per character music volume sfx and just voice in general really giving you a lot of ways to adjust it and make  with the game  the english translation is fantastically done and the series is presented in chapters with even a fantastic intro after chapter 1 that made it feel like a legit anime each character is very different and while it seems to focus a bit more on two in particular every character gets a lot of love and spotlight  overall ive always been a huge fan of visual novels from the really deep stories to sometimes a fun and lighthearted one and sometimes a few are forgotten or just arent  nekopara though is not one that will fade away from my mind any time soon and is worth the playthrough great sound fantastic voicing beautiful animation user friendly and just silly fun and adorable ride worth taking,POS,0.7103220820426941

Definitely worth a play if you're into anime of any genre. I know most of the reviews only mention how sexy and suggestive the game is, but it's unfair to ignore the other factors that make this game shine. Nekopara Vol. 1 is also...  Cute. Insanely cute. Funny. Quirky. Tear-jerkingly sweet at times.  The artwork is beautiful and the translation is, for the most part, very good. As you've likely read around, this was originally a hentai game. That being said, the game is very, very short (I finished it in a little over 4 hours, but that's only because I took my time and wandered away from my PC at times). Calling Nekopara a game is a stretch, however: it's a visual novel through and through. You click, you read, you enjoy the story presented to you. Plain and simple.

"tl;dr: 5/10. It's all right. Mostly just cute stuff and a lot of nothing happening.  [h1]Full review:[/h1]  Upon release, I heard Nekopara had become a cringeworthy, BnP-tier meme and unfunny Youtubers were doing let's plays and reaction videos and whatever other garbage that pre-teens love to slurp up. I quickly forgot about this, along with the game, until I saw it on sale once and decided ""why not?"".  First off, the story. It's certainly existent, but that's about it. Other than NotShirou preaching MUH MORALS at people who really don't want to give him the time of day, the story literally goes nowhere. It's quite honestly on the level of porn without plot VNs, and although the story isn't supposed to be the selling point, the game is strictly a visual novel, so it's worth a mention.   Contrary to this, the technical points were more or less up to scratch, the worst of it being no lower than ""subpar"". There are a good number of CGs, sprites and backgrounds despite the game taking the better part of 2 hours to finish, and the soundtrack, although nothing really to write home about, doesn't subtract from the overall enjoyment of the game.   Another feature I liked was not the chest bounciness slider (though that was a welcome addition), but the option to play in Japanese. Although this translation isn't as bad as some of Sekai Project's other releases - being barely up to scratch this time - I felt like I got a lot more out of what little story there was once I switched over.  Overall, it's cute girls doing cute things with H-scenes you can patch in. I wouldn't buy it at $10 considering the amount of content, but if this is what you're after, then it wouldn't be a terrible buy if it were on sale.

They don't have the brainpower of a human, they are essentially children with some cat instincts as far as their minds go. So: without an owner they cannot sustain themselves in human society, and they are not physically equipt to survive in the wild like feral cats do. Not that they could sustain themselves even if they could function in either light because the rabbit hole goes deeper yet. At the time of writing this i have not finished the game but there is no mention of a male counterpart: the species is ""catGIRL"", they are incapable of (to put it delicately) unassisted procreation. They also go through life with all the biological failings of a cat (going into heat, GREATLY accelerated aging).  In his arrogance man hath birthed a lifeform incapable of anything but being a pet at best and a stray beggar at worst: and that must be (again, delicately put) assisted to perpetuate their species. A race of humanoids too human to survive as an autonomous community or being in the wild, yet too animal and simple minded to go through life in human society fluently.  And perhaps the worst part is that they lack the faculties for the deeper thought on these issues to even realise their horrifying place in the world at large.   If I had to rate it on a number scale, I'd give it a ""SCIENCEHASGONETOOFAR"" out of Ten it really makes you think",this is a horrifying tour de force  in the grim near future mankind has  modified cats into humanoid catgirls this in itself raises many to question the ethics of the world at large if this were to pass but it gets darker they dont have the brainpower of a human they are essentially children with some cat instincts as far as their minds go so without an owner they cannot sustain themselves in human society and they are not physically equipt to survive in the wild like feral cats do not that they could sustain themselves even if they could function in either light because the rabbit hole goes deeper yet at the time of writing this i have not finished the game but there is no mention of a male counterpart the species is catgirl they are incapable of to put it delicately unassisted procreation they also go through life with all the biological failings of a cat going into heat greatly accelerated aging  in his arrogance man hath birthed a lifeform incapable of anything but being a pet at best and a stray beggar at worst and that must be again delicately put assisted to perpetuate their species a race of humanoids too human to survive as an  or being in the wild yet too animal and simple minded to go through life in human society fluently  and perhaps the worst part is that they lack the faculties for the deeper thought on these issues to even realise their horrifying place in the world at large   if i had to rate it on a number scale id give it a sciencehasgonetoofar out of ten it really makes you think,NEG,0.9363434314727783

"Having completed NEKOPARA Vol. 1, I ask myself three questions: 1. What is the purpose of a visual novel game? 2. Are visual novel games for me? 3. What the flying fuck am I doing with my life?  Playing a visual novel is essentially reading a book with beautifully drawn and animated pictures but with voices to offer that extra bit of immersion. Nekopara is a story about leaving home, running a patisserie and looking after catgirls (I was  especially interested in Nekopara because of my unnatural weakness to animal girls.) What I did find especially interesting is that if you were to collate all the information you find out about catgirls in the world, and try to understand it, it doesn't make too much sense, let alone give a reason for the existence of these scientific 'abominations'.  On the other hand, they're SO CUTE, and I totally want one. Nekopara does a good job of telling a rather sweet story (or erotic story, if you buy the uncensored version) that is in actuality quite mediocre as I can summarise it in about two sentences.  The 'player', if you can call them that, is told the story from their perspective, which is as far as the game goes to involve you. Honestly, I was a bit bored, having just finished 'Hotline Miami' before playing Nekopara I felt a bit psychotic and was surprised to find myself a little disappointed that I didn't get to kill anything in the visual novel (anybody else feel like that after playing video games - perhaps you can recommend a good psychiatrist?) For people who need a dose of ""kawaii"", who are too restless to watch anime and too lazy to play a 'proper' game.  Ending on a positive note, you can speed run the game, with only one hand, in about 5 minutes or 20 minutes for the uncensored version ;)",nekopara vol 1 i ask myself three questions 1 what is the purpose of a visual novel game 2 are visual novel games for me 3 what the flying fuck am i doing with my life  playing a visual novel is essentially reading a book with beautifully drawn and animated  but with voices to offer that extra bit of immersion nekopara is a story about leaving home running a patisserie and looking after catgirls i was  especially interested in nekopara because of my unnatural weakness to animal girls what i did find especially interesting is that if you were to collate all the information you find out about catgirls in the world and try to understand it it doesnt make too much sense let alone give a reason for the existence of these scientific abominations  on the other hand theyre so cute and i totally want one nekopara does a good job of telling a rather sweet story or erotic story if you buy the uncensored version that is in actuality quite mediocre as i can summarise it in about two sentences  the player if you can call them that is told the story from their perspective which is as far as the game goes to involve you honestly i was a bit bored having just finished hotline miami before playing nekopara i felt a bit psychotic and was surprised to find myself a little disappointed that i didnt get to kill anything in the visual novel anybody else feel like that after playing video games  perhaps you can  a good psychiatrist for people who need a dose of kawaii who are too restless to watch anime and too lazy to play a proper game  ending on a positive note you can speed run the game with only one hand in about 5 minutes or 20 minutes for the uncensored version,NEU,0.7950444221496582

"OK let's get the first thing out of the way: this is a kinetic novel, as in a visual novel with absolutely no choices. The characters are very well animated and the voice acting in Japanese is fantastic, at the level of ""real"" anime. The catgirl characters are very, very cute. The story lasts somewhere between 4.5 and 5 hours if you have it on auto-play. On the basis of these things I do recommend it.  There are some negative points though. A small negative point is a small number of mistakes in the text of the game: an apostrophe that shouldn't have been there, a word that doesn't exist and some awkward phrasing. The story is a bit rambling and oddly-paced in places and I felt like a ""real"" anime would have probably been paced better. This brings me to another point: I did enjoy this but a real anime would probably have been better with more varied animation and so on. I felt maybe I only enjoyed this so much because I haven't watched a real anime for a while.  In terms of adult content: most of the game is just cute: there's almost zero fan-service but there are one or two pretty adult things in the text (not in the pictures).  Anyway that's it. Please stop reading now because I want to moan about something in the plot but it is possibly spoilery and since the story is the whole thing with this, you don't want to know it ahead of time:  SPOILERY BITS UNTIL THE END    SPOILERY BITS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED   Ok, so I'm really not some tumblr kind of ""feminist"" or anything, and I hate that sort of person who goes around being ""offended"" and ""triggered"" by everything but really there are some pretty ""off"" things in this story. You have this whole category of women: catgirls who basically resemble women except for having tails, ears and certain feline behaviour traits, but apart from that they are women. These women are ""owned"" by ""masters"" as pets (but basically slaves, I suppose). They are utterly subservient, pathetically eager to please and very naive about the world and have to be told everything. They are used for work and for sex; If they go out on the street without displaying their bell that proves they passed an exam where they have to suppress their true nature, they get arrested. This is not just like the normal ""harem"" type of anime like Tenchi Muyo, Oh My Goddess or Love Hina: it really is a step beyond that in the treatment of its female characters. Anyway, I'm not really complaining about it or being offended, it's just something I didn't like about the anime.  Apart from that you have the main character saying some line about being a bit confused about seeing his two catgirls as both daughters and lovers which was a bit creepy; the drawing of them both in bed with him they really are drawn as underage; then there's the incestuous masturbation of one catgirl on the other (they are supposed to be twins), and the incestuous love the main character's sister has for him.  I'm just saying really that despite enjoying the story I was creeped out by a few of the lines in it",ok lets get the first thing out of the way this is a  novel as in a visual novel with absolutely no choices the characters are very well animated and the voice acting in japanese is fantastic at the level of real anime the catgirl characters are very very cute the story lasts somewhere between 45 and 5 hours if you have it on autoplay on the basis of these things i do  it  there are some negative points though a small negative point is a small number of mistakes in the text of the game an apostrophe that shouldnt have been there a word that doesnt exist and some awkward phrasing the story is a bit rambling and oddlypaced in places and i felt like a real anime would have probably been paced better this brings me to another point i did enjoy this but a real anime would probably have been better with more varied animation and so on i felt maybe i only enjoyed this so much because i havent watched a real anime for a while  in terms of adult content most of the game is just cute theres almost zero fanservice but there are one or two pretty adult things in the text not in the   anyway thats it please stop reading now because i want to moan about something in the plot but it is possibly spoilery and since the story is the whole thing with this you dont want to know it ahead of time  spoilery bits until the end    spoilery bits you have been warned   ok so im really not some tumblr kind of feminist or anything and i hate that sort of person who goes around being offended and triggered by everything but really there are some pretty off things in this story you have this whole category of women catgirls who basically resemble women except for having tails ears and certain feline behaviour traits but apart from that they are women these women are owned by masters as pets but basically slaves i suppose they are utterly subservient pathetically eager to please and very naive about the world and have to be told everything they are used for work and for sex if they go out on the street without displaying their bell that proves they passed an exam where they have to suppress their true nature they get arrested this is not just like the normal harem type of anime like tenchi muyo oh my goddess or love hina it really is a step beyond that in the treatment of its female characters anyway im not  about it or being offended its just something i didnt like about the anime  apart from that you have the main character saying some line about being a bit confused about seeing his two catgirls as both daughters and lovers which was a bit creepy the drawing of them both in bed with him they really are drawn as underage then theres the incestuous masturbation of one catgirl on the other they are supposed to be twins and the incestuous love the main characters sister has for him  im just saying really that despite enjoying the story i was creeped out by a few of the lines in it,POS,0.9411752820014954

"Honestly, this game is way over-rated. There's practically no conflict in the story, and what little exists is solved within a few slides of being created. There are *literally* no choices to make so that kills replayability.  Basically, you're this guy opening a bakery and everything just seems to go your way and everyone seems to love you for no appearent reason. The ""love"" everyone has for you doesn't feel remotely real and feels incredibly forced. As for the sex scenes, this is the pg edited version that has awkward jump-cuts jutted in there jumping straight to the aftermath when they're asleep and under the covers.  However, I will say if you're looking for a feel-good, happy-go-lucky, cutsie story, then this is for you.  Overall, I'd give this game a C+. It's a passing grade, but it's not all that great.  P.S. If you're looking for fap material, you can put the tissues away, because there isn't any.

"Well, playing through this Visual Novel was a breath of fresh air for me, and I did quite enjoy reading through the story.  Aside from that, the novel had some good and bad points in my opinion that need to be noted.  Do note that this is my opinion and to respect my opinion on this game.  Why do I like the game?  1. The Story is interesting, and different that one you would not expect from the Visual Novel genre. 2. The characters are very interesting, and each character plays off one another in interesting and humorous ways. 3. The E-mote system in the Novel is a wonderful addition to Visual Novels.  (Characters can move, seen talking, sway, jump, all sorts of stuff.) 4. The art style is amazing.  What am I neutral about in the game?  1. The Jiggle Physics slider.  Don't really care much about it.  It goes from unresponsive to Armegeddon level movement for anyone and everyone.  I just left it neutral for a more realistic experience. 2. The Earthquake Button... 3.  No dialouge choices... as long as the story is entertaining and fun. 4. Shigure... 5. The English sub could be written better.  I have seen a good share of bad grammar and misspellings in the game.  What do I dislike about the game?  1. The story is interesting, but It really isn't that deep of a story.  I know It's the first volume, so It can be different later on.  but that was a bit offputting when I finished the game. 2. Extreme lack of other minor male characters.  This made me feel like I was in a world losing a lot of it's men.  The only other male we know the existance of is Kashou's and Shigure's father. (I do hope the story includes their parent's in a future volume for a much better story.) 3.  Extreme lack of other character portraits in general.  The only other character that got a portrait was another catgirl you see early on in the story. 4. The Catgirl lifespan.  This was quite annoying that they could read and write in under a year after birth, this making them smarter than humans in that regard, and growing to human size much faster than a human was creepy.

"Like so many others, I had gotten this game expecting nothing more than an easy fap to nekos. That was seriously the ONLY expectation I even had coming in to the game was sexy catgirls. First thing I did, before I even opened it, was download the uncensored patch from online. Then I actually started playing...  See, the game (story really, there aren't any options) met my very basic expectations, and added substantially. It really made me a PART of the story, I really felt a connection with Chocola and Vanilla! I didn't think of them as the catgirls, I thought of them as MY catgirls. I know that's a looser thing to say, but I mean it.  The story is very touching, happy, and bubbly, and is told with EXCELLENT art and animation. Seriously, they characters were always moving (except in the rare, beautifully made still images), and that little element really added to the story.  Overall, this game was far more than anything I had expected.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes nekos, and to be perfectly honest you can enjoy it very much even without the uncensored version; the story is DEFINATELY sound enough on it's own.  And as a bonus, there is definately going to be a Vol 2, based on the ending of this and the success of Vol 1.",like so many others i had gotten this game expecting nothing more than an easy fap to nekos that was seriously the only expectation i even  in to the game was sexy catgirls first thing i did before i even opened it was download the uncensored patch from online then i actually started playing  see the game story really there arent any options met my very basic expectations and added substantially it really made me a part of the story i really felt a connection with chocola and vanilla i didnt think of them as the catgirls i thought of them as my catgirls i know thats a looser thing to say but i mean it  the story is very touching happy and bubbly and is told with excellent art and animation seriously they characters were always moving except in the rare beautifully made still images and that little element really added to the story  overall this game was far more than anything i had expected  i highly  it to anyone who likes nekos and to be perfectly honest you can enjoy it very much even without the uncensored version the story is definately sound enough on its own  and as a bonus there is definately going to be a vol 2 based on the ending of this and the success of vol 1,NEU,0.6498771905899048

"NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a VN where there are no choices to make. It uses the E-mote 2D animation engine, which allows characters to show a variety of emotions, and adds some physics effects to the characters. Parts of the game are missing from the Steam version, and can be obtained elsewhere.  Story: This story is about the protagonist, Kashou Minaduki, moving away from home to open a bakery. Two of his family's Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, decide to follow him there and help him with his work. Kashou, with the help of his sister and the other four catgirls of his family, learns how to take care of Chocola and Vanilla, while managing his bakery. The story is a ""slice of life"" story and is too clichéd since many elements can be found in VNs, Anime and Manga. The universe/setting of this story seems a bit dark; I still wonder how catgirls came into existence, why some are criminals and some are abandoned on the streets without a owner. There are a lot more questions I have about the universe/setting. Overall, I would rate the story 6/10.  Characters: The personalities of the characters are very clichéd. There is some character development for the main characters. It is really awkward how you only encounter one male character, the protagonist, in the story if I am not mistaken. All other characters, including the police officer, customers, etc., you encounter are all female. Overall, I would rate the characters 6/10.  Music: The music is great. Nice catchy songs, and even has an opening and ending song. Don't have anything to complain about for the voice acting and sound effects, except that there are only Japanese voices. I would rate the music 9/10.  Artwork: The artwork is amazing. Really good animations and physics effects for a VN. Some scenes are reused too much. Overall, I would rate the artwork 9/10.   Overall: I would rate this game 7.5/10. I do like happy endings, the artwork, the physics effects and animations.

"[h1][b]Score: 6/10[/b][/h1] as a VN +1 if you like anime +1 if you like cat girls +2 if you are into hentai  [b]Similar Games[/b] Tokyo School Life  [b]Summary[/b] The main character has moved away from home and is opening up a bakery. He finds the two cat girls hiding in one of the moving boxes. The game provides a history on why cat girls exist which is nice. Chocola is obviously in love with the main character and Vanilla follows Chocola in everything she does.  [b]Positive[/b] The art style in these games is pretty much as good as it gets for a VN. The facial expressions and animations are all but flawless. The humor parts a great, but don't occur often enough. Strangely the romance comes off as totally normal for the world that it takes place in.  [b]Negative[/b] Well at the end of the day this is still a Hentai game with the Hentai removed so it could be put on steam. Thus the main character ends up sleeping with both Chocola and Vanilla giving you no date sim type options. Although back story is given for why this must take place it still feels very wierd. Wierder still is the fact you have a younger sister that must be the devil because it appears she set it all up for you to get hanky panky with them. The game seems to cover every type of anime fetish known to man and instead of giving you date sim options just has the main character sleep with everybody... which may in later volumes include his own sister.  [b]Conclusion[/b] This game is a strange creature. Somehow a hentai game without the hentai is proving to be a better product even for those with no hentai interest. Maybe this type of title will set a higher bar for the future of VN's on Steam.  [b]Value[/b] Honestly it's probably worth close to the asking price even if your just a VN fan. If you like cute anime girls it's worth full price. If your a cat girl fan it's worth more.

"This game has a good length, but it's deceptively empty. For all the claims of a 'great' story, it's mostly fanservice and build-up.

"The game and story was great. Light and Bubbly... the only thing I found that was kinda uneeded rather ironically for a H-Visual Novel was the actual Hentai Scenes themselves. It seemed kinda forced onto a story that would've been fine without it, especially considering that they come so suddenly and out of nowhere that it actually slowed the story down in my opinion. (no pun intended) I guess due to this being Sayori's work however some hentai had to be somewhere.   Basically if you purchase this game to only reap the H-scenes... I'd suggest going to Google.

"Kinetic VN are getting more and more amazing. This one is more like playing an anime than most.  If you like anime this is the game for you. It's colourful, lovely and surprisingly story rich albeit a bit brief.  You play Kashou the most alpha male super baker in all of Japan and live in a world where some god among men scientists have created geneticly engineered cat girls. Where all of them even your underage sister is magneticly attracted to you.  These cat girls are like real girls but better in everyway. They're cute, submissive, have the IQ of a primary school girl, cute and despite being barely a step above real house cats are perfectly being happy being locked up in a home or use at a non breeding slave. Sounds like heaven right?  The cakes you make as a baker give girls orgasms and your family is so rich buying and opening a bakery in your name by yourself is chump change.  These cat girls which cost obviously more money than actual cats in food, hair care and clothing that your middle school sister owns 6 of them. Many of which are only 1-4 years old and have the fully devellopped bodies of girls in their teens and late teens.  You (Kashou) and your 9 month old 14-15 year old bodied cat girls in skimpy outfits run La Soileil, A bad french grammar bakery where you exploit your cat girls Chocola and Vanilla to dance around cutely and sell cups of sugar to suckers for insane prices.   Chocola is a low IQ brunette with bigger emotional ups and downs than an amusement park ride and Vanilla a stone faced albino.      Ok Joking aside it's a damn good VN and has alot to give. No choices in dialog and it's just an anime with no male VAs when set to autoplay. This version has no sex scenes in it and 100% honest to god truth, doesn't even need any. I'm serious, this could stand alone as just a story about cute girls with some lewd-ish moments. The characters are well voiced and it's an interesting world to catch a glimpse of.  The art is spectacular to watch and having it animated in a kinetic VN is better than nearly all before it.

"It's Sayori's original characters stepping onto the visual novel stage! The artwork and production values are as high as expected. The novel uses the e-mote system which allows for animations with full CG quality. The story itself is somewhat simplistic but fairly adorable. If you're looking for branching paths or any form of gameplay, though, there are none. It's a few hours of story and considering it's one of the very few high quality from-Japan VNs on Steam right now, it's well worth the $10, IMO.   It needs to be noted that there are two versions of this VN, though. The Steam version is the all-ages version with the sex scenes cut out. The 18+ version is only available from DLsite but it costs twice as much so there is a trade-off.

"In case you're unaware, Valve are forcing all eroge developers to release censored versions on steam. As kotaku points out, there are plenty of games that don't get censored for sexual content, including The Witcher franchise and of course, GTA.  This 'game', in the very strictest sense, is a Visual Novel, the story is completely linear and there are no choices for different paths, having said that, I'm not sure I'd want to spend the time do multiple paths either. The story so far has been pretty boring and uneventful, the visuals are 'nice' especially when streamed to the Gear VR HMD - Chocola' name badge is massive.   It seems that most of the effort has gone into animating the Neko's breasts and stripping content, and while this may be a draw for some, it doesn't quite have the depth you expect from a highly rated eroge.  I'd love to recommend this, but I'm only going to continue 'playing' in case the prequel/sequel improve upon the above points.

For one it has a long playability but no paths like other games i.e If My Heart Had Wings, Everlasting Summer, etc. So one run through is all you're going to get, it may not seem worth it but look at my hours.. That's with me speedreading, i didn't taking my time reading and going in depth. This is a very emotional anime/Vn i've seen since Everlasting Summer and a few others. [spoiler]For one *spoiler* the protagonist gets sick and nearly loses both the girls because they try to help him... Their faces...... The emotion... The feels!! ;_; And yes i did shead a tear at that part, call me a big baby, go ahead i dare you. I will send you the hentai patch... oh wait you would probably like that *all evil jokes aside*[/spoiler] The hentai patch, like all other VN's, ruins the game for me. But the good thing about it is if you want to see very little hentai *like half of 2 chapters out of 11* then it's not that bad. Most of your playthrough will have you laughing though as well.. Cat girls... or in this case as ""I"" will call them... nekos! I'm not spoiling much but i will say something, if you don't want a possible harem anime... *sorry if i spelt that wrong* do NOT go after this game, for one the two nekos, at the end it turns into 5, plus your sister making advances at you in the story making it lean to incest, well not actual ""advances"" more like he leaves the room and she talks to herself saying how she would love to be with him.. All weirdness aside, if you can ge past all of the stuff i said.

"Nekopara is a high quality kinetic novel (meaning no interactions, only reading) featuring catgirls and adult themes, although the Steam version is censored unless you apply some shenanigans to it (refer to this Community Hub link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370848130). The voice acting is in Japanese with subs for Japanese, English, and Chinese.  The art is extremely well done and fairly crisp. I played in a 1600x900 resolution which appears to be as high as it goes. Fullscreen will give it black borders as the game will maintain its aspect ratio to prevent stretched catgirls (very important). The level of quality that Nekopara has in terms of its art assets remains consistent throughout the entire experience with good coloring, shadowing, and light animations to help give the characters life such as head turning, blinking, breathing, and breast jiggling depend on how you use that slider.  I have no complaints with the music. It has tunes ranging from upbeat to laidback and brought me closer to my inner anime. The game comes with a music player that can Play, Stop Repeat, and Repeat All should you decide to just chill out. The opening song is pretty good.  Finally, the story seemed appropriate for what it was trying to do. It had its fair share of funny and “What is going on?” moments. The story follows Kashou and how he handles the two catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, coming into his life when he’s trying establish himself in the world as a baker. I don’t recommend thinking too hard about the rules that the world has regarding catgirls as those kind of discussions could lead to very strange places.  Voice acting seemed fine with tones that matched the dialogue. I really liked how they would say some of the verbs out loud. Rub, rub, for example. Or stare.

They are smooth and very much like watching an anime. -Instant fan service/gratification -Super cute, tug-on-your-heartstrings cat girls -The addition of super cute voice acting -Bouncy you-know-what slider  Cons: -The story is nothing to get excited about. Even with how short it is, there was ample opportunity to not go the typical route, but sadly at no point is it unpredictable. -Characters are also very typical. You have the holy trinity of fan service: Super cute, overly excited girl, super shy, reserved girl,  and doting protagonist who just happens to have this all fall into his lap. -The emote system while smoother and providing nice animations as mentioned above, are not really ""countless"" as suggested in the games description. There are four main poses that get used throughout the majority of the game. -No replay value. Except for that...maybe...  All in all, I'd suggest it as a guilty pleasure.

"[b][u]Overview[/u]:[/b]  NekoPara Vol. 1 is a relatively short Japanese kinetic visual novel from NEKO WORKS that dazzles in the visuals but falls short in a lot of other areas.  It is the first entry in what I'm sure will be a successful series and functions as a prologue to a world where catgirls are a part of every day society.  [b][u]Reviewer's Notes[/u]:[/b]  Cocerning the eroge aspect and the 18+ version versus the All Ages version, the Steam version of this game is the All Ages version.  That means all the adult content that is in the normal game is cut out or in a few rare cases left in but censored (such as the bath sequence).  As far as I know there will be no official patch or release of the 18+ version of this game on Steam.  There are ways to get around this and those that are interested in circumventing this particular decision should be able to do so easily.  For this review I will be looking at the game as a complete product, meaning the 18+ version.  The All Ages version does not add anything to the game, only remove.  For some people this will be for the good of the experience, for others not so much.  It really depends on how well you do with eroge visual novels and this one is pretty tame all things considered.  [b][u]Story[/u]:[/b]  Without going into too much detail the general arc of NekoPara Vol. 1 is our protagonist, Minazuki Kashou,  moves out to open up his own patisserie, ""La Soleil.""  He comes from a long line of Japanese confection makers but dreams of doing Western treats.  This causes some friction between him and his family and thus he heads off on his own.  While moving into his new place he discovers two catgirls hiding in boxes among his stuff.  These are our two female lead characters, Chocola and Vanilla.  His family has a whole bunch of other catgirls that his sister primarily takes care of that occasionally make an appearance along with his sister as the story plays out.  The main focus, however, is on our protagonist along with Chocola and Vanilla and follows them through the opening of his new business and their lives after.  It is a sweet, silly, and occasionally laugh out loud funny tale that is pretty predictable.  It is a by the books moe romp, setting up for a full on harem power trip in later volumes, with dashes of eroge fetish fan service throughout.  None of the characters are written exceptionally well.  In the case of the 18+ version you will get to slam in about three sex sequences that come in relatively rapid succession that very slightly will affect your feelings for the characters, but only in a blatant ham-fisted way.  [b][u]Visuals[/u]:[/b]  The first thing you will notice when you play this game is the visuals are stunning.  Visual novels are a dime a dozen, ones with high production value however are much more rare.  NekoPara Vol. 1 goes above and beyond in this regard, which should be expected from Sayori and NEKO WORKS.  The sprites are exceptionally well done and thanks to the dubbed ""E-mote System,"" they are almost fully animated, meaning expressions are ever changing, eyes blinking, hair moving, the works.  This is by far the most impressive thing about NekoPara Vol. 1 and NEKO WORKS should be proud.  [b][u]Sound Design[/u]:[/b]  The voice acting is done very well, assuming you don't mind it being all in Japanese, with dedicated deliveries and a lot of character.  The music ranges from acceptable to down right bland.  [b][u]System[/u]:[/b]  The interface is clean and easy to use.  The font choice is good, very easy to read, and I had zero issue with navigating around and interacting with the game.  The options menu is relatively robust, especially in the audio department, and upon completion you should have a nice full Extras section completely with the CG Gallery, Scenes Gallery, Music, and Movies.  [b][u]Conclusion[/u]:[/b]  NekoPara Vol. 1 isn't a bad visual novel, it does the job it sets out to do.  If you like visual novels and want to support the medium then it is probably worth playing.  If you are a fan of beautiful art then it is probably worth playing.  If you like shallow and predictable but still strangely sweet stories then it is probably worth playing.  And of course  if you have ever wanted to bang catgirls then it is probably worth playing.",buoverviewub  nekopara vol 1 is a relatively short japanese  visual novel from neko works that dazzles in the visuals but falls short in a lot of other areas  it is the first entry in what im sure will be a successful series and functions as a prologue to a world where catgirls are a part of every day society  bureviewers notesub  cocerning the eroge aspect and the 18 version versus the all ages version the steam version of this game is the all ages version  that means all the adult content that is in the normal game is cut out or in a few rare cases left in but censored such as the bath sequence  as far as i know there will be no official patch or release of the 18 version of this game on steam  there are ways to get around this and those that are interested in circumventing this particular decision should be able to do so easily  for this review i will be looking at the game as  product meaning the 18 version  the all ages version does not add anything to the game only remove  for some people this will be for the good of the experience for others not so much  it really depends on how well you do with eroge visual novels and this one is pretty tame all things considered  bustoryub  without going into too much detail the general arc of nekopara vol 1 is our protagonist minazuki kashou  moves out to open up his own patisserie la soleil   from a long line of japanese confection makers but dreams of doing western treats  this causes some friction between him and his family and thus he heads off on his own  while moving into his new place he discovers two catgirls hiding in boxes among his stuff  these are our two female lead characters chocola and vanilla  his family has a whole bunch of other catgirls that his sister primarily takes care of that occasionally make an appearance along with his sister as the story plays out  the main focus however is on our protagonist along with chocola and vanilla and follows them through the opening of his new business and their lives after  it is a sweet silly and occasionally laugh out loud funny tale that is pretty predictable  it is a by the books moe romp setting up for a full on harem power trip in later volumes with dashes of eroge fetish fan service throughout  none of the characters are written exceptionally well  in the case of the 18 version you will get to slam in about three sex sequences  in relatively rapid succession that very slightly will affect your feelings for the characters but only in a blatant hamfisted way  buvisualsub  the first thing you will notice when you play this game is the visuals are stunning  visual novels are a dime a dozen ones with high production value however are much more rare  nekopara vol 1 goes above and beyond in this regard which should be expected from sayori and neko works  the sprites are exceptionally well done and thanks to the dubbed emote system they are almost fully animated meaning expressions are ever changing eyes blinking hair moving the works  this is by far the most impressive thing about nekopara vol 1 and neko works should be proud  busound designub  the voice acting is done very well assuming you dont mind it being all in japanese with dedicated deliveries and a lot of character  the music ranges from acceptable to down right bland  busystemub  the interface is clean and easy to use  the font choice is good very easy to read and i had zero issue with navigating around and interacting with the game  the options menu is relatively robust especially in the audio department and  you should have a nice full extras  with the cg gallery scenes gallery music and movies  buconclusionub  nekopara vol 1 isnt a bad visual novel it does the job it sets out to do  if you like visual novels and want to support the medium then it is probably worth playing  if you are a fan of beautiful art then it is probably worth playing  if you like shallow and predictable but still strangely sweet stories then it is probably worth playing  and of course  if you have ever wanted to bang catgirls then it is probably worth playing,NEU,0.7384359836578369

As I read through, I slowly began to appreciate the personalities of the characters and the world around them. If you are looking for something to fap to, look no further, as Nekopara delivers on that front quite well. However, there is more to this visual novel adaption than eroticism.  Nekopara is developed by Neko Works, a company consisting of the original artist of the manga works, Sayori, and various programmers and scenario writers. It was localized by the famous Sekai Project, who also brought The Fruit of Grisaia and is bringing Clannad to North America. Nekopara is built on the Kirikiri engine, featuring a plugin called the ""E-mote"" system, which brings the characters to life through smooth animations. The opening song (OP) is Taiyou Paradise, sung by nao. The ending song (ED) is Nekomanma Biyori, sung by Haruka Shimotsuki. Nekopara was released on Steam on December 29, 2014 for $10.   [h1]Premise and Story[/h1]  Nekopara is set in a world in which some humans have been genetically modified to have cat-like features (or is it the other way around?), such as cat ears, tails, and general cat behaviour. These humanoid cats are deemed ""catgirls"" and are a common component of Japanese families. They are treated like normal pets and important members of the family. They can understand and communicate with humans at a basic level, although the complexities of human emotions and societal structure remain incomprehensible. In order for a catgirl to be trusted on their own in the world, they must take a Bell exam so that they can earn a Bell. These Bells signify that the catgirl wearing them is fit to walk among humans, and that their owner(s) have educated them sufficently.  The story starts with the protagonist, Minaduki Kashou, moving out of his parents' house to start up his own bakery, Patisserie La Soleil. The grammatical error is explained, I assure you. As he is unpacking his things, two medium sized boxes catch his attention. Two catgirls, the energetic, enthusiastic Chocola and the soft-spoken, subtle Vanilla spring out of the boxes, greeting their master. Kashou's younger sister, Shigure, smuggled them aboard the moving truck so that they could assist Kashou in his business. Over the course of Volume 1, the catgirls develop romantic feelings for Kashou under the guise of physical maturation, then they finally admit their feelings. Despite the fluffy and light nature of the story, there are some emotionally charged moments that enraptured me. [spoiler] Chocola shares some intimate memories of her and Vanilla's childhood early in the novel, and the last chapter involves Kashou nearly dying from overwork and the catgirls rushing to find a doctor. [/spoiler]  [h1]Gameplay and Presentation[/h1]  Nekopara is a kinetic novel, which means there are no player choices. The story is told almost entirely from Kashou's perspective. The player's interactions consist of:  Left Click/Enter: Advance text Ctrl: Skip text P: Makes characters' breasts jiggle Alt-F4: Emergency panic button  The VN is divided into 8 chapters, and each chapter is 45 minutes to an hour long, depending on how fast you read and if you listen to the voice acting (which is superb). If you decide to install the 18+ patch, there are 3 sex scenes spread out between chapters 5 - 7. Without the sex scenes, a readthrough takes about 4-5 hours, and 6-7 hours with the patch. The E-mote system provides silky smooth character animations and movements. To be honest, it's the first time I've seen this much liveliness in a visual novel, so it was impressive to me.   The art style is clean and well presented, with vibrant colours and detailed facial features. The backgrounds are relatively simple, but beautifully rendered. Almost all of the artwork was done by Sayori, the original artist of the Neko Paradise works. Not much to say about the art except that it is alluring and utterly gorgeous to look at.  All of the characters with the exception of the protagonist are fully voiced. In addition to the onscreen characters, there are unseen tertiary characters such as shop owners and passersby that are voiced as well. All audio is in Japanese, although you may set the text and interface to English, Japanese, or Chinese.   Sekai Project's localization is both accurate and humourous. Take a look at my screenshots for proof of this. Listening to the voices and comparing it to the text, I found little to no errors in the translation, and honorifics were kept untouched, which is a personal plus. Keep in mind that I am not experienced in the Japanese language, but I do know basic structure and particles. Take my words with a grain of salt.   [h1]Final Remarks/Conclusion[/h1]  In short, whether you are a fan of anthropomorphized cats or not, Nekopara is a highly enjoyable visual novel. Although the main appeal of this series is the H-scenes, the patch is optional. The Steam version was censored because of Steam's policies and to appeal to a wider audience. A quick Google search will grant you access to the adult files, so don't worry about missing out. Nekopara still offers a complete and cute experience, if a little too focused on romantic pursuits. For $10, I would say it's more than worth the asking price. It's simply [b]nyanderful![/b]",h1introductionh1  ill be honest initially i thought that my main source of enjoyment from the first entry of the nekopara visual novels would be the sexual encounters

"First off, there is absolutely no interaction whatsoever, so set the text speed to something you're comfortable with and throw away your mouse, you'll never need it. Also the jiggly bits slider never seemed to change anything.  Lets start with the good parts. Catgirls are cute, bakeries are awesome, the uniforms for said bakery are pretty awesome, and the protagonists sister is adorable. The voice acting is about what you would expect from a title like this, nothing too special but its certainly not bad by any means. I was impressed with the E-Mote (think Live2D animations) system and animations that make the characters feel much more alive than regular old 2D could do, there are issues with this system that I'll bring up in the negative points.  I was extremely disappointed with the utter lack of interaction, no branches in story no choices, nothing. The story isn't that great and the characters don't change or grow much, but that can attributed to this being Volume 1 and also to this being less of an example of interactive fiction and more of a porn game with the porn removed. The scenario feels a bit contrived even allowing for suspension of disbelief about cat-people I never could quite find myself immersed. (I readily admit this is probably a personal failing.) The E-Mote system causes very noticeable stuttering when loading new characters into a scene; I was not the only one suffering from this problem, according to the forums.  On a more personal level, I didn't enjoy the protagonist getting together with multiple catgirls, especially given how many assets their designs reused, it just felt like two versions of the same character and I feel like the experience would have improved by just cutting one of the two characters or having two minor arcs dictated by a choice early on while leaving the one not selected as a background character.  All said, if you're excited for this title, I recommend getting the R18 version. This title is not worth the time without the explicit scenes in it and I don't even like that sort of thing.",first off there is absolutely no interaction whatsoever so set the text speed to something  with and throw away your mouse youll never need it also the jiggly bits slider never seemed to change anything  lets start with the good parts catgirls are cute bakeries are awesome the uniforms for said bakery are pretty awesome and the protagonists sister is adorable the voice acting is about what you would expect from a title like this nothing too special but its certainly not bad by any means i was impressed with the emote think live2d animations system and animations that make the characters feel much more alive than regular old 2d could do there are issues with this system that ill bring up in the negative points  i was extremely disappointed with the utter lack of interaction no branches in story no choices nothing the story isnt that great and the characters dont change or grow much but that can attributed to this being volume 1 and also to this being less of an example of interactive fiction and more of a porn game with the porn removed the scenario feels a bit contrived even allowing for suspension of disbelief about catpeople i never could quite find myself immersed i readily admit this is probably a personal failing the emote system causes very noticeable stuttering when loading new characters into a scene i was not the only one suffering from this problem according to the forums  on a more personal level i didnt enjoy the protagonist getting together with multiple catgirls especially given how many assets their designs reused it just felt like two versions of the same character and i feel like the experience would have improved by just cutting one of the two characters or having two minor arcs dictated by a choice early on while leaving the one not selected as a background character  all said if youre excited for this title i  getting the r18 version this title is not worth the time without the explicit scenes in it and i dont even like that sort of thing,POS,0.6345837116241455

They convinced him to let them stay and help him with the cafe. Two things I liked from this visual novel; it's animated and there voice acting although the voice acting is in Japanese, I assume.

I was no longer able to find joy in games, so when I first started up this game I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story.  I was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well. What can I say, I guess I'm just too much of a hunk! Keep playing and you might get as good as me.  The animation really makes them seem alive. I keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them. The art is not only very cute, but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters. It's even better than talking to humans. Before this game I had no one. Now I have not one, but TWO cat wives who love me! Who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally?  Even better is the immersive programming. The characters always seem to follow my eyes, and whisper my name at night. I can't figure out how you guys programmed that! Great job though.

"Nekopara is a Kinetic Visual Novel (Meaning you're reading a story with no decision making from you, the player.) The story centers around a man named Kashou Minaduki, who moved away from his family, without notice, to start a new life and open up the bakery he's always wanted. However, he is followed by two catgirls named Chocola, and Vanilla; two of the six catgirls that are within the Minaduki family. The two girls want to stay and live with Kashou because they love him, and that he's their ""master"". This is set in a world where catgirls are domesticated much like cats, so there's an owner and pet vibe going on, but they're obviously more intelligent than cats, and can do more. The rest of the story basically settles around Kashou coping with Chocola and Vanilla while trying to maintain the business and order of the bakery, and how the catgirls are going to affect his life and relationship with them.  This is a rather lighthearted story with lots of cute, funny moments coming from the two girls. A positive is that this story is fully voice acted (In Japanese), has animation thanks to a program called ""E-Mote"" where facial and body animations are possible, and a wonderful, casual soundtrack that's very memorable, and calming to listen to. There's also a decent amount of CG art that's made for specific scenes, with a little more detail.  Obviously, this story isn't for everyone. Like I said, it's a lighthearted story with funny moments and admittedly heartwarming chapters. You can really get attatched and connected to the characters if you're up for a tale such as this one. The story has lots of moments such as Chocola and Vanilla acting all cutesy and purring, meowing, stuff like that. People would be split on this depending on what you like, but I personally find that super adorable and makes the characters much more likeable.  It's not just that though, there is character development, and the story does actually go somewhere. It's not so much slice-of-life if you were thinking that. It mainly revolves around Kashou's relationship with Chocola and Vanilla, the bakery's business, and the girls earning their ""bells"" (Which you'll learn as you read along.) There is quite a few things going on, and the story never feels like it's halthing in one spot for too long.  If you like this kinda story, love catgirls, or are a fan of anime, then this is for you, it's vey polished and well done for what it is, and I was honestly surprised and what i got myself into.

I haven't been so satified in many different ways from a powerpoint since I first installed Crysis on my Emachines back in 2008. If you think this is a joke review, then I don't blame you; NEKOPARA does not look like much aside from the cute girls and words dancing under their customizibly bouncy chests, but what it offers is a true deconstruction of the slice-of-life archetype, and this alone makes the journey worth embarking.  I do not wish to spoil much, but NEKOPARA Vol. 1 tackles sensitive themes such as human trafficking, slavery, genetic modification, violations of the Geneva Convention, the politics of a cross-species society, and beastiality. The unnamed town our protagonist moves to is clearly that of a monitored police-state, not unlike that of City 17, where the upper-class rule over the lower-classes with an iron fist. I can say no more, but holy shit. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 does not hold back.  It really does sound like I'm making shit up, but this is honestly not a joke. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 hides it's true nature under what looks to be a shallow fap, kind of like a convincing trap. But unlike a trap, it didn't stop me after the fact.

Nekopara (Cat Paradise) Is a very cute visual novel about catgirls being mixed in the world and well about if cats were able to live in human forms.  Story is based on a rich guy who likes baking and opens a baking shop by 'running' away from home and then suddenly... Catgirls appear who are called by Vanilla and Chocola.  It is a cute story but nothing really gets done other then perversion and cats.. lots and lots of cats.  Now other then that the Pros and Cons.   Pros: Music is great and the animations for a visual novel is something I have never seen before and looks well detailed and something that is amazing on your eyes to look at. OH and boob jiggling settings you should max out before starting.   Cons: Not much story but the cuteness and personality of the characters tends to make you forget that there is basically.. not much of a story...

I would recommend to play the full version with R18 to get the complete feeling of the story.  This is not a dating sim but more a linear story driven game , this game just takes the player as the main character in the game. It's like reading a novel, there are no choices to choose from. You just need to click ( or press the same button on your gamepad ) to advance the story.  After you completed the story you have finished volume 1 then the game ends.

Really beutifully animated and even voiced. Must have been a lot of money put into this game. However playing it is a bit of a culture shock. Can be a bit too kawaii for some folks.   I myself found the game to be among the few that makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrased on a constant basis while playing.   There was once a time when I could embrace the ...moe of such a genre but that time has passed for me. If hyper kawaii is your style don't hesitate this VN is pretty refreshing in terms of style.   For everyone else like me you will open this game and be pleasantly suprised by the game and then suddenly overcome with questions relating to civil rights. Do the cat people die at the age of 20 like most felines? Do they have SS numbers? Do they have rights? These cat people seem to be sentient hybrid creatures that humanity perhaps created. Are they sent on suicide missions like many animals during the early space program? Do their lives have less value than a human life? If you hit one with your car can you just drive off without finding the owner the way that it is in the US?  Many questions either way enjoy the game.,really beutifully animated and even voiced must have been a lot of money put into this game however playing it is a bit of a culture shock can be a bit too kawaii for some folks   i myself found the game to be among the few that makes me feel  and embarrased on a constant basis while playing   there was once a time when i could embrace the moe of such a genre but that time has passed for me if hyper kawaii is your style dont hesitate this vn is pretty refreshing in terms of style   for everyone else like me you will open this game and be pleasantly suprised by the game and then suddenly  with questions relating to civil rights do the cat people die at the age of 20 like most felines do they have ss numbers do they have rights these cat people seem to be sentient hybrid creatures that humanity perhaps created are they sent on suicide missions like many animals during the early space program do their lives have less value than a human life if you hit one with your car can you just drive off without finding the owner the way that it is in the us  many questions either way enjoy the game,NEU,0.8184298276901245

"Writing a review to represent those of us who made a mistake.  If there were less than 100 reviews, I wouldn't submit because it's probably not fair for me to judge.  **I have never seen Anime, nor played a game like this.**  Decided to try it on a whim because Princess Robot Bubblegum from Grand Theft Auto IV makes me laugh everytime I watch it, and I adore Japanese women.    Apparently you need more than a love of Japanese women and a positive genre impression to love a game like this.  I'm clearly out of my league.  I went into it with no expectations, and somehow came away disappointed.  There's no game here, but it's a visual novel, so I didn't expect one.  But for a novel, the writing reminds me of Judy Blume or some adolescent paperback pulp like the Babysitter's Club.  I appreciate the bouncing breasts, but was surprised the animation doesn't strike me as good as South Park: The Stick of Truth... a low bar, to be sure.

"Played the demo and definitely worth getting the game, i am not a huge fan of visual novels, i find them to get boring really quickly with too much reading and too much non relevant content.   This one is fantastic, the music is well composed and changes in all the right places, the voices are too cute and just perfectly placed for each character. the storyline is more voiced with little extra descriptive text which is think is great. ui is clean and put together nicely. price is really cheap at $9.99 i would probably buy it even if it was a bit more. also the animations are great, they add so much life to the characters and keep you from dying of the boredom involved in clicking through static content of 2-4 lines of text.

"In general, I like to quantify the amount of enjoyment I'm having. In the case of Nekopara, the metric I used to gauge my enjoyment is nyas per minute, or npm.   For reference, the famous ""Nyan Cat"" clocks in at an impressive 397 npm, +/- 2 nyas. While it is theoretically possible to exceed 400 nyas per minute, no human or computer has ever achieved such a feat. So for the purpose of this analysis, I will treat 400 npm as the soft cap for what is technically achievable by game developers.  Analysis:  In the minute long samples I took, the average was at 15 npm +/- 1 nya. During sex scenes, the npm dropped to around 10 npm. Npm peaked when three or more catgirls were on the screen, sometimes reaching as high as 31 npm. That Nekopara could have such a high nya density and still maintain coherent dialogue is an impressive feat to say the least.  Conclusion:   Given that the npm of Nekopara is only 1/26th the amount of npm in Nyan Cat, it only makes sense that the game itself is roughly 1/26th as popular as the internet viral video. This is not to say that I, as an individual, enjoy it 1/26th as much as the aforementioned video, just that given the statistical information above, the disparity in viewership is not unexpected.",in general i like to quantify the amount of enjoyment im having in the case of nekopara the metric i used to gauge my enjoyment is nyas per minute or npm   for reference the famous nyan cat clocks in at an impressive 397 npm  2 nyas while it is theoretically possible to exceed 400 nyas per minute no human  has ever achieved such a feat so for the purpose of this analysis i will treat 400 npm as the soft cap for what is technically achievable by game developers  analysis  in the minute long samples i took the average was at 15 npm  1 nya during sex scenes the npm dropped to around 10 npm npm peaked when three or more catgirls were on the screen sometimes reaching as high as 31 npm that nekopara could have such a high nya density and still maintain coherent dialogue is an impressive feat to say the least  conclusion   given that the npm of nekopara is only 126th the amount of npm in nyan cat it only makes sense that the game itself is roughly 126th as popular as the  viral video this is not to say that i as an individual enjoy it 126th as much as the aforementioned video just that given the statistical information above the disparity in viewership is not unexpected,POS,0.7872679829597473

It doesn't mean that you might not like it if you are alien with those, but it is rather recommended to know the anime/manga terms.  Personally I have played several visual novels (mostly where you have choice in it) and there was one major point that shines in this game, that is animation; yes this visual novel has mostly animated scenes and characters; also to add it consists japanese dubbing with chinese, english or japanese subtitles to choose, which I especially like.

"I was attracted by the title when I saw steam releasing a new Comic Market release, after I investigated a little bit and decide to buy it full price - I'm the kind of person usually wait for titles to pick up until it went on sale, but the ""good"" reviews and my curoisity overwhelmed by patience on the title. I ""beat the game"" in 6 hours and I feel for 10 dollars, this is not bad for a visual novel.  Pros:  High animation quality (In terms of Visual Novel) - The main game is basically reading a novel, but with slideshows involved. I have ""played"" some visual novels in the past, but this time I'm pleasently surprised due to the movement of the characters are actually pretty good (except for some death stares when they forgot (I think?) to animate the eyes). The characters move pretty realistically (again, in visual novel standards), and the legendary ""P"" key enchance the gameplay for approximately 200%.  Good voice acting - This is mostly personal preference, but I do like the voice acting in the game. It's anime-y and it gives you the vibes of watching a shounen ""full of service"" anime. Also I highly appreciate the publisher keeping the original voice cast instead of going for the localization of games (I'm looking at you, Dynasty Warriors).  Cons:  NOT a dating sim - I don't know what steam's definition of ""Dating Sim"" is (Or better yet, who put dating sim in the tag in the first place), but a dating sim in my book involves choices - choices that you choose determines which girl you are pursuing, but this game has no choices at all, basically it's the ""Left click and you beat the game"" game. I have no problem Nekopara has no choices whatsoever, but please steam, don't mislead people into thinking they are playing a game which they have choices.  Cutting content - I know that steam is trying to fend off the ""made for erotic sensation"" games in steam, but cutting content still stinks no matter what the reason is. For those who are not aware: The game is originally R-18, but steam decides to only include the non R-18 content (The original have the settings to enable/disable it). It does not affact the story much (Only 3 scenes are invloved), and there are fixes that enable the content (Check out the only guide in this game for details), but I feel like it's like playing witcher 2 without the sex - It's okay, but it feels weird.  Small typo on subtitles - I did not check the japanese subtitles (as I do not know japanese well enough), but the chinese and english subtitles have small typos and paste errors. It does not affact the game much, and the rest of the translation is top-notch... but just a minor con in my opinion.  In general I recommend this game if you like Visual Novels and the ""sweet-sweet"" type story, and I'm looking forward to Sekai Project's next game to publish, cause I feel they have enough passion to gather such a new VN to steam, I feel and hope they will publish more high quality VNs here.",i was attracted by the title when i saw steam releasing a new comic market release after i investigated a little bit and decide to buy it full price  im the kind of person usually wait for titles to pick up until it went on sale but the good reviews and my curoisity overwhelmed by patience on the title i beat the game in 6 hours and i feel for 10 dollars this is not bad for a visual novel  pros  high animation quality in terms of visual novel  the main game is basically reading a novel but with slideshows involved i have played some visual novels in the past but this time im pleasently surprised due to the movement of the characters are actually pretty good except for some death stares when they forgot i think to animate the eyes the characters move pretty realistically again in visual novel standards and the legendary p key enchance the gameplay for approximately 200  good voice acting  this is mostly personal preference but i do like the voice acting in the game its animey and it gives you the vibes of watching a shounen full of service anime also i highly appreciate the publisher keeping the original voice cast instead of going for the localization of games im looking at you dynasty warriors  cons  not a dating sim  i dont know what steams definition of dating sim is or better yet who put dating sim in the tag in the first place but a dating sim in my book involves choices  choices that you choose determines which girl you are pursuing but this game has no choices at all basically its the left click and you beat the game game i have no problem nekopara has no choices whatsoever but please steam dont mislead people into thinking they are playing a game which they have choices  cutting content  i know that steam is trying to fend off the made for erotic sensation games in steam but cutting content still stinks no matter what the reason is for those who are not aware the game is originally r18 but steam decides to only include the non r18 content the original have the settings to enabledisable it it does not affact the story much only 3 scenes are invloved and there are fixes that enable the content check out the only guide in this game for details but i feel like its like playing witcher 2 without the sex  its okay but it feels weird  small typo on subtitles  i did not check the japanese subtitles as i do not know japanese well enough but the chinese and english subtitles have small typos and paste errors it does not affact the game much and the rest of the translation is topnotch but just a minor con in my opinion  in general i  this game if you like visual novels and the sweetsweet type story and im looking forward to sekai projects next game to publish cause i feel they have enough passion to gather such a new vn to steam i feel and hope they will publish more high quality vns here,POS,0.9403960108757019

"This game CHANGED MY LIFE. After my wife left me there was a hole in my heart I didn't think I could ever fill again. I was no longer able to find joy in games, so when I first started up this game I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story.  I was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well. What can I say, I guess I'm just too much of a hunk! Keep playing and you might get as good as me.  The animation really makes them seem alive. I keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them. The art is not only very cute, but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters. It's even better than talking to humans. Before this game I had no one. Now I have not one, but TWO cat wives who love me! Who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally?  Even better is the immersive programming. The characters always seem to follow my eyes, and whisper my name at night. I can't figure out how you guys programmed that! Great job though.  The game is so good that I'm never going to stop playing. I'm finally happy again. THANK YOU NEKO WORKS!!!",this game changed my life after my wife left me there was a hole in my heart i didnt think i could ever fill again i was no longer able to find joy in games so when i first started up this game i wasnt expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story  i was wrong the first time i met eyes with chocola something moved deep inside me we instantly clicked she laughed at my jokes she liked talking to me sure enough we quickly fell in love with each other never before have i seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely but what surprised me is that vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well what can i say i guess im just too much of a hunk keep playing and you might get as good as me  the animation really makes them seem alive i keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them the art is not only very cute but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters its even better than talking to humans before this game i had no one now i have not one but two cat wives who love me who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally  even better is the immersive programming the characters always seem to follow my eyes and whisper my name at night i cant figure out how you guys programmed that great job though  the game is so good that im never going to stop playing im finally happy again thank you neko works,POS,0.6903061270713806

"So erm Nekopara.... Right off with the review!  So Nekopara is a visual novel or eroge if you want to call it. Now what's a visual novel? Technically visual novel is like a movie, voice pack, picture book, and usually visual novel are rate 18+ but with steam you have the all age version.  (To get the R 18 Go here -> http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE144678.html)  Now Nekopara you play as a guy, Minaduki Kashou. You just open a small bakery in a small town and just as you were moving and clearing your item. you encounter two box which seems oddly out of place.... Meet the two main heroine. Chocola and Vanilla two cute cat girl! Here your adventure start with your two lovely cute cat girl.  Pros:  This is the 1st few Visual novel i played that have animated moving character sprite and it does help you get more into the game then most visual novel does. +Great animation   The game also provide good voice acting, cute infact!  ( granted i don't play japan game with English voice so i wouldn't know how the English voice acting sound like...) +Good voice acting  The character are likeable (just about it) +Likeable character  The Meh part:  The game length is reasonable. i clock in at about 6 hour or so. -/+ depends on how you view it. to me it felt right, any longer will feel like a drag.   Cons:  Ok so in visual novel usually there are choices, which decide which heroine you want to romance with. But this feature doesn't seem to be anywhere in this game... so it took me out of bit and actually. Replay vaule in visual novel are important, by introducing so many character and off no different at all is sad and make  me wish for more. Only reason to actually play this again is maybe in a few weeks or months time. -No choice -No replay vaule.  Conclusion: Do i think you should buy it? Well honestly.... Yes!  If you are a fan of visual novel with tons and tons of cats/Neko then give this a shot. If you are a fan of muti ending, and want different route to play with then.... sadly you wont find any here. But i say buy this to show support!  Support this title so next time we might see more visual novel on steam!

"4/10 No backstory; is this a different world? Is it a different timeline? If it's earth did the cats mutate? Are they aliens? How did they first meet humans, etc. The overall story isn't particularly engaging.  Quite predictable as well. I didn't feel like I could relate or empathize with the main character at all. In terms of being a vn: visual novels are meant to give the player a sense of control in how they affect the storyline. The fact that the player cannot influence any of the  protagonists decisions in the VN is a fairly big deal and severely affects replayability. The game is based around the premise of ""cats that are humanoid"" however they don't act like cats. Cats in general I have found to be standoffish and much more self absorbed then they are portrayed in this VN and this causes the feline character to seem much more doglike. The art is amazing however, and the visual effects are quite fluid (transitions, the boob jiggle, expression changes etc.) Music was quite standard with other visual novels. Not bad but not outstanding.  In summary, subpar as a game, subpar as a visual novel but it has nice art and decent music for its genre. Not worth $10 however if you're curious pick it up if it's less then $3.   P.S If you are interested in light novels after this game, and have never read Katawa Shoujo...

"Similar to Sakura Spirit; this kind of isn't a game, its more like an book in some aspects.  But unlike Sakura Spirit, Nekopara has actually shown some heart and care, and has put in both voice acting and done some very fluid animations for pretty much all scenes.  The steam version has a good chunk of the adult content cut out; but I am told that it is possible to go find the 18+ version elsewhere; if you have the money for both, you can technically combine them so your playing through the steam overlay and getting the achievements, while at the same time getting the hentai content originally created for the game.  I imagine the 18+ content was left out for child/family friendliness... or else theres intentions to make it as separate dlc content later on. Don't know.  Also unlike Sakura Spirit, I can actually stand to read what the main character is saying.  Not to mention the storyline for Nekopara looks, so far, like it will be far longer than Sakura Spirit, and with a good deal more thought put into it; even if it is sort of more of a ""slice of life"" modern day fantasy setting.

"So~~~  Everyone here knows what he or she is in to I hope. The full version is an adult visual novel, this means there is r18 content.  Now, for those that are conserned, the steam version cut out all the r18 content. It is possible to enable the full game on steam if you have the files from the uncut version.  I have played throught the full version, so including the r18 content. Please do keep that in mind while reading the review.    Once again, everyone here knows what he or she is getting in to. Nekopara Vol. 1 is the first chapter about you, you are making a new start by starting up an patisserie called ""La Soleil"". While you are moving you notice 2 extra boxes, seems like some catgirls from home snuck along for the ride! You start of by wanting to send them back home, but they really do not want to be seperated from you, they plead, they beg and the amount of willpower you can muster start to falter. They can stay.  and this is the start of your adventure ;)  Now about the game itself. I really enjoyed the story, I found it well thought out. Vanilla and Chocola have a good back and forth compatability, and while this may be subjective I really liked the way they voiced them. The voices fit really wel, this has also been done for other recurring characters! I would like to note that on auto reading it will take you just a bit less then 6 hours to finish Nekopara Vol. 1  As for the visuals, this is somewhat unlike a normal visual novel. Normally VN's are like a picture book, the pictures are still and the picture changes when something happens. In Nekopara Vol. 1 small bits and pieces have been animated.  This small addition made it really nice to watch what was unfolding. The background and overall characterdesign are really well done as well in my honest opinion.  The music was ok, nothing too memorable there but it is good for what it wants to do. I have not had the feeling that it was annoying or anything of the likes in the whole playthrough.  Also there is one thing I want to say about the settings. There is a ""Boob bounciness"" setting, you can set it from no movement at all to gravity defying so~ This was weird to see in the options, but thank you Sekai Project for implementing!  Last thing, more than once I got a message from my friends that looked something like this: ""What the heck are you playing?!?!?"" So be prepared to be judged by your friends.  Now as for my recommendation, I will recommend Nekopara. I will however say that the r18 version is the one you want. I will play through the cut version to see what the impact of the cut has on the Steam version. The art is very nice, I liked the characters, the music wasn't great but it was passable and there is an very interesting settings option.   Now I just want the Steam trading cards and I'm set. ... ... At least untill they announce Nekopara Vol. 2 :')",so  everyone here knows what he or she is in to i hope the full version is an adult visual novel this means there is r18 content  now for those that are conserned the steam version cut out all the r18 content it is possible to enable the full game on steam if you have the files from the uncut version  i have played throught the full version so including the r18 content please do keep that in mind while reading the review    once again everyone here knows what he or she is getting in to nekopara vol 1 is the first chapter about you you are making a new start by starting up an patisserie called la soleil while you are moving you notice 2 extra boxes seems like some catgirls from home snuck along for the ride you start of by wanting to send them back home but they really do not want to be seperated from you they plead they beg and the amount of willpower you can muster start to falter they can stay  and this is the start of your adventure   now about the game itself i really enjoyed the story i found it well thought out vanilla and chocola have a good back and  and while this may be subjective i really liked the way they voiced them the voices fit really wel this has also been done for other recurring characters i would like to note that on auto reading it will take you just a bit less then 6 hours to finish nekopara vol 1  as for the visuals this is somewhat unlike a normal visual novel normally vns are like a  book the  are still and the  changes when something happens in nekopara vol 1 small bits and pieces have been animated  this small addition made it really nice to watch what was unfolding the background and overall characterdesign are really well done as well in my honest opinion  the music was ok nothing too memorable there but it is good for what it wants to do i have not had the feeling that it was annoying or anything of the likes in the whole playthrough  also there is one thing i want to say about the settings there is a boob bounciness setting you can set it from no movement at all to gravity defying so this was weird to see in the options but thank you sekai project for implementing  last thing more than once i got a message from my friends that looked something like this what the heck are you playing so be prepared to be judged by your friends  now as for my  i will  nekopara i will however say that the r18 version is the one you want i will play through the cut version to see what the impact of the cut has on the steam version the art is very nice i liked the characters the music wasnt great but it was passable and there is an very interesting settings option   now i just want the steam trading cards and im set   at least untill they announce nekopara vol 2,NEU,0.8454573750495911

Really didn't want this game to have any sex scenes to maintain the purity and moe factor of this VN...  GODBLESS They removed the sex scene. I'm a guy too so naturally we all want some X here and there, but I don't want any XX happening when it involves my favourite fictional idol. Judge me all you want and say I'm immature and shit but don't you get frustrated when your favourite anime waifus gets featured in a hentai or eroge? (Unless you're really down-right dirty)  Nekopara is really heart-warming, adorable and gives you a very lovely nostalgic and lovely feeling though  ''If we really love you then even if it's troublesome we want to be with you. That is a reason to want to be with you.'' That quote was enough to make me buy Nekopara the story set out as humanoid cat-girls is really common but this has it that they have the mindset of both a human and a cat even as to get distracted by cat toys. Welp, Nekopara is seriously heart-warming like Little Busters! and lovely like Clannad (Not as sad as Clannad though)  **SPOILERS**   When Chocola was feeling the heat as she enters the ''mating season'', I was really frustrated at this VN that they'll be making this cute, lovely and innocently pure VN into another eroge.

"This game is beyond adorable. The entire story is well-written ((in my honest opinion)), the animations are as smooth as I've ever seen in the past and the artwork itself is fantastic.   While the game does have its ""low points"", some of it being grammical errors or cheesy story-writing here and there, Nekopara Vol 1 was an outstanding accomplishment. I hope that the developers are very proud of how well they did with this visual novel. I loved every second of the story, getting both versions of the game. The background music is very engaging and appropriate for each scene and chapter. The opening page of each new chapter is very well done and they each gave me a smile.  The story is very well-written, keeping me hanging on every word. Each character was brought out at the right time and presented in such a way that they never got old when ever they were brought back in. The only things I have an issue with when it comes to the narrative is that the sentence structure of ""__ did __ when I __  __"" I noticed it a lot during the beginning and middle portions of the narrative itself as I went through. Also, there were moments where the VAs could have expressed more emotion into the words they were saying in some parts of the narrative. I'd give examples, but I'd be too worried of spoiling the experience from other people. However, those are the only quips I have about the story writing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the animation of each character model. I feel that the developers should be very proud of how well they turned out. The thing about static character models is that you only get one face most of the time, with the only changes being when the character has a shift in attitude. The use of animated models are exceedingly better ((depending on how well they are done)) can give the player a much better view on what a character is feeling. In Nekopara, there were moments where VAs didn't express the seriousness of some of the situations. However, that was almost immediately remedied by the expression the character models presented as they moved and talked with the spoken words.

"It’s been a while since I played a visual novel, and unexpectedly this became a reminder of why I like them. Nekopara is dubious to say the least, as it’s a story about a man getting sexually involved with cat girls.  This is designed to provide relief from the horrible reality of every day life. The world of Nekopara is bright, pure, and uncomplicated. It’s full of love and hope. Whatever happens in the world, it’s never sinister, never dark. The most dramatic thing that happens is people getting sick. And because the stakes are so low, it manages to get some drama out of everyday events. The world doesn’t go under, nobody is hurt, nobody dies.   It delivers exactly what it says on the box. Definitely not for everyone. Can’t deny I found it pleasant, and it made me want to play more visual novels. Not because I crave more cat girls in my life. I just enjoy the process of playing them. Because you click to get the next line of text, you feel in control of the pace. Nothing punishes you for wanting to take it slow, or if you blaze through a scene. Unlike games the story doesn’t go on break. Every click advances the plot. Visual novels are their own thing, separate from games, film, books or comics. I like their mechanics, and the possibilities they provide for telling stories in ways which blur the line between mediums.  Nekopara doesn’t try to do much. But for what it is, it’s well put together. It’s enough to make me excited about playing other titles with more ambitious stories. And that’s enough for me to not harbor any negative feelings toward the title. I’m glad Steam has become a place where both this and Hatred can co-exist.",its been a while since i played a visual novel and unexpectedly this became a reminder of why i like them nekopara is dubious to say the least as its a story about a man getting sexually involved with cat girls  this is designed to provide relief from the horrible reality of every day life the world of nekopara is bright pure and  its full of love and hope whatever happens in the world its never sinister never dark the most dramatic thing that happens is people getting sick and because the stakes are so low it manages to get some drama out of everyday events the world doesnt go under nobody is hurt nobody dies   it delivers exactly what it says on the box definitely not for everyone cant deny i found it pleasant and it made me want to play more visual novels not because i crave more cat girls in my life i just enjoy the process of playing them because you click to get the next line of text you feel in control of the pace nothing punishes you for wanting to take it slow or if you blaze through a scene unlike games the story doesnt go on break every click advances the plot visual novels are their own thing separate from games film books  i like their mechanics and the possibilities they provide for telling stories in ways which blur the line between mediums  nekopara doesnt try to do much but for what it is its well put together its enough to make me excited about playing other titles with more ambitious stories and thats enough for me to not harbor any negative feelings toward the title im glad steam has  a place where both this and hatred can coexist,POS,0.526245653629303

"NEKOPARA isn't a game. It's an amazing Visual Novel, and I recommend it extremely. We play as Kashou Minaduki, he moved out from his home without telling anyone, in order to open his own shop ""La Solei"" But soon after moving in, 2 giant boxes get send to him; Inside of them are Chocola and Vanilla, the two catgirls from his original home, who want to be with their master. And this is where the fun begins. Chocola and Vanilla are two catgirls who want to be with their master a lot, even when Master doesn't want them to be here, because he wants to have a fresh start: They don't wanna go away. Master was the person who cared about them the most, and they don't wanna leave Master. The soundtrack is pretty great, and fits for each respective scene. Voice acting is done nicely, and all the characters sound extremely cute.  And the animations and art in general, it's so great that I can't even believe it. It's done smoothly, and cutely. In other words, in the best way possible. And if you're trying to learn Japanese/Chinese, then this game can even help you with doing that. There's an option to turn on both, English and Japanese/Chinese subtitles at the same time, so you can learn words easily. As the game goes on, the characters are developing over time, in a very good way. The story is very good too, it introduces every character in a good way, and explains nicely what's going on at all times.   I would tell you a lot of more reasons as to why I really like this VN, but if I did I would spoil a lot of the game, and I don't want to do that.  In other words, if you like visual novels and/or love adorable catgirls, get this game.

"First of all, as you should know, this isn't a game. It's a Visual Novel, which is kind of like a book with a more visual focus. Most VNs have some gameplay elements, like picking a choice and thus altering and/or branching the story slightly or majorly. THIS VN HAS NO SUCH THINGS. There is absolutely not one single choice in this, and as such, it can't be called a game at all.  Well, a book is fine too.  Now then, for a VN, the UI in the game is superb. Pretty much only outdone by Majikoi. Let's see now: + The default resolution is 1280x720, but the game has 10 hotkeys for resolution ranging from miniscule 320x180 to 1600x900. You can also stretch the window to whatever you want and use ""Lock resolution to (your current window size)."" This makes it easy to just stretch the window into 1920x1080 and lock it there. When you next launch the game, the game will remember your locked resolution. - The game tends to go to 1921x1080. If you're autistic like me, you'll be resizing until you finally get the proper 1920x1080. + The game upscales BEAUTIFULLY. I do not know what resolution the ingame files are, but I cannot notice the upscaling pixels at all at 1080p. If the ingame files really are 720p - and why wouldn't they be since that's the game default resolution? - then this upscaling is by far the best I've ever seen. + Full controller support, you can rebind keys in Advanced Settings. + Multi-core support. At least, that's in Advanced Settings... but I honestly can't tell the difference on my computer so it may or may not work. By default it's in 1 core, but you can set it to Auto (why is Auto not the default option...?), 2, 4 or 8 cores. + Steam Cloud support. By default it's on Automatic, but you can manually opt to ""Update local save data to Steam Cloud,"" ""Download save data from Steam Cloud"" and ""delete save data from Steam Cloud."" - Overly zealous Steam Cloud support. I'm not sure does the game store your config and savefiles on your computer at all by default - they're stored in Steam Cloud. At least, when I turned off Steam Cloud automation I lost everything until I manually used ""Download Save Data from Steam Cloud."" I would recommend that the first thing you do when you launch the game is taking off Cloud support (and restart the client) so that you won't get screwed over incase you want to continue playing (read: reading) offline. + The File menu can be hidden with a nifty little X. Pressing Alt will, as always in Windows, bring the File menu back up - this time with a nifty little + if you want to unhide the menu. + Triple language support. The game comes with Japanese dub and the text comes in English, Japanese and Traditional Chinese. There's a separate setting for System as well for the same three languages. + Dual language display support. You can set the text language to Japanese/Chinese and select ""Simultaniously display text using System and language setting"" and you will get both your System language (English, I assume) as well as Japanese/Chinese. Want to brush up on your moonrunes? No problem: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=368457378 + The E-Mote system, including the famous Breast Bounciness Slider. More of which later (at the very end, actually). + Everything else you'd expect from a quality VN UI, like volume adjustment per character and message window transparency.  Now then, after advertising the great UI... what else is there to say?  The ""game"" is SHORT. You might blaze it through in two hours and I wouldn't be surprised. This is, however, a cheap title and ""Volume 1"" so I find this entirely acceptable. For your money's worth... this VN by far surpasses Sakura Spirit (which at the point of this writing) is pretty much the only competitor on Steam. I'd personally recommend even full price on this title.  Plotwise, the game doesn't offer you much. If compared to Sakura Spirit, this game at least has consistency and doesn't feel like short sketches just slapped together. It's just small ""slice of life"" cut. Other than that, you can pretty much just expect cuteness rather than character development. And bouncing breasts (unless you set Breast Bounciness Slider into ""The British Royal Guard"" setting like some other Reviewer said).  The Steam version is the ""All Ages"" version. The full game has pornography which is forbidden on Steam. You can buy the full game from elsewhere (costs roughly double compared to the Steam version) and extract it over the Steam version. If you launch the game with -steam=""yes"" option you can use the full version on Steam with no problem. Achievements and everything works perfectly. I would strongly advice you against posting screenshots of adult content into Steam Cloud, however.  The English translation is iffy at times. If it was a free game, the slight iffyness would be at a fully acceptable level. This is a commercial product, so it's not acceptable. The demo had a DREADFUL translation and thankfully, the translation has noticeably improved from then. Not to perfect though, sadly.  Voice Acting felt good to me. I have absolutely no complaints. I will not praise any VA into the heavens either, but they did a solid job if you ask me.  Music is not a strong point of the game. There are no fantastic tracks in the game, but no dreadful ones either. Some musics successfully set the mood right so it's not a complete flop.  Sound Effects... ... let me be honest, the SFX of this game are outright terrible. For a commercial product they are pretty much inexcuseable. In the Steam version they might be almost okay, but if you play the full version... eugh.  The strenght of the game when compared to other games is in the E-Mote system. Not something I can properly express in text - I'd suggest you YouTube search ""nekopara vol 1 introduction"" for the official introductions from Sekai Project. They should give you a pretty good idea on what the E-Mote system does. But if I were to try to explain in text... well, the girls move on the screen. Constantly. This is done by having multiple layers on the girls, and interactions of these multiple layers gives them a very, very wide variety of expressions - even more so since the game mostly has catgirls, which means that they have twitchy ears and a tail. It looks absolutely gorgeous. If I were to complain about something, it is that their up-and-down sway stops whenever they're talking. And that up-and-down sway is a bit over the top to begin with... anyway, it actually makes the game feel better OUTSIDE of the CGs. Because the CGs are static and only have a few expressions made into them. Usually, you want to see the the static CGs in VNs because those are the gorgeous parts - here it's in reverse! As I said, you have to see it to get a good feel of it. A LOT of effort was put into the emotions of all the girls, it truly looks fantastic.  tl;dr; If VNs are your thing, this is a short but quite solid experience. I give it my recommendation and I am looking forward to Vol 2.",first of all as you should know this isnt a game its a visual novel which is kind of like a book with a more visual focus most vns have

Totally awesome, would def do it again. 10million/10   Read Nekopara before going to bed, and get @##ed by Nekonoids while sleeping.  It was intensively awesome, would def get poned again. 10trillion/10.  Adult version can be fully combine with steam version and still get achievements R18 version is now my soul food. 10infinite/10  Do I recommended? Totally It helps you reborn to another magical dimention. .................................................... Serious Review:  ok, I am only talking about Steam version at here.  Good:  1. Kawaii Voice acting and character personality  2. Great art work, and it has tons of relative product, like hugging pillow, manga (all age, ichi and hentai) and such. Very good for fans and collectors.  3. Contains many useful vocaburaries in Japanese, thats good for Novice Japanese learner .   4. Bouncy Button is an interesting concept. Love it.  5. Good soundtrack and music  Bad:  1. This Visual Novel has good voice acting, but few scenes voice record quality is a little cachy   2. There isnt multiple ending or story routine you can choose.  3. Translation in Chinese can do better job.  4. To be honest, I dont think the story is very exciting, but the music makes it touching.  The main reason i bought this visual novel is because I use to follow his early work. I am happy to see the artist grow and improve. Hoping to see more of his work.  You dont have to like this visual novel, but its always good to support something you like.",bias review  this game makes me wanna buy cakes and cookies and wanna own a nekomaid bakery shop 1010  kitties touch your tail for you 10hundred10  master japanese  chinese by reading all three languages totally educational 10thousand10  after reading nekopara i cross play as nekosojo to work office and randomly set up a new year party totally awesome would def do it again 10million10   read nekopara before going to bed and get  by nekonoids while sleeping  it was intensively awesome would def get poned again 10trillion10  adult version can be  with steam version and still get achievements r18 version is now my soul food 10infinite10  do i  totally it helps you reborn to another magical dimention  serious review  ok i am only talking about steam version at here  good  1 kawaii voice acting and character personality  2 great art work and it has tons of relative product like hugging pillow manga all age ichi and hentai and such very good for fans and collectors  3 contains many useful vocaburaries in japanese thats good for novice japanese learner    4 bouncy button is an interesting concept love it  5 good soundtrack and music  bad  1 this visual novel has good voice acting but few scenes voice record quality is a little cachy   2 there isnt multiple ending or story routine you can choose  3 translation in chinese can do better job  4 to be honest i dont think the story is very exciting but the music makes it touching  the main reason i bought this visual novel is because i use to follow his early work i am happy to see the artist grow and improve hoping to see more of his work  you dont have to like this visual novel but its always good to support something you like,POS,0.9742713570594788

The game has everything you could ever want out a relationship, cute girls, affectionate petting, tragic backstories, jiggling breasts, you name it, this game has it all. Now I see the light. Now I understand why 2D is superior to pig disgusting 3D women.  Unlike 3DPD, Chocola and Vanilla love their master unconditionally and remain ever faithful, more than you could ever expect from some horrible, demanding women in exchange for a few measly hours of gratification. And even then, both Chocola and Vanilla are capable of providing on that level, so there is no real good reason to opt for a gf when you can have your own catgirl.  Thank you, NekoPara!

"Nekopara is a beautiful love story between a man and his loyal cats showing him the value of family. It's the kind of light hearted love story that sincere, sensitive, gentle men would enjoy. Married men may want to sit this one out, but I would say it could make you more romantic and appreciative towards your spouse; clingy if you take it too far. And for any female gamers who may be interested in Nekopara: bless you for being able to step into a male protagonist's shoes and understanding.  I can not stress this enough: Nekopara is a heavenly fantasty that leaves you begging for more. Part of you will feel extremely satisfied after completion, but another part of you will be left longing for the warm embrace of a lover. IMO, these are very disirable feelings to have, and can only make you a better, sweeter person.  Nekopara Vol.1 is the first part of an upcoming series. And while the play time is only several hours, I think you may appreciate the low asking price. There is an adults-only version of the game available outside of Steam.

I really like that it's possible to change languages on the fly and also to have multiple languages visible at once if you choose. It really shows the amount of effort that went into this release. It also has controller support which is handy for playing with Steam home streaming on TV.  It's a shame that the AO version isn't on Steam, but that's Valve's fault for believing that it's necessary to push American values on the rest of the world.

Yes, these catgirls are pretty devoted, but there’s more going on than a simple harem storyline. One can’t help but be intrigued by Kashou’s devotion to baking, understanding both catgirls, and wanting to see everything turn out well. With that said, some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up. Others might be mad knowing they’ve missed out on some scenes due to Steam’s restrictions on adult content. Still, NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.  8/10",nekopara vol1 looks like it fits 100 into an outsiders view of visual novels a dull fandomfocused story with pretty girls who do nothing but dote on you yes these catgirls are pretty devoted but theres more going on than a simple harem storyline one cant help but be intrigued by kashous devotion to baking understanding both catgirls and wanting to see everything turn out well with that said some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up others might be mad knowing theyve missed out on some scenes due to steams restrictions on adult content still nekopara is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with  810,NEU,0.7269788980484009

"The  motion  in  this  game  is  fantastic  same  with  the  artwork.  As  a  anime/manga  lover  and  a  person  who  reads  a  lot  of  anime  visual  novels  i  just  cant  get  into  this game. The  plot  itself  is  just terrible  and  the  explaination  for  cat  girls  doesnt  make  sense  either. To  me  its  just fan  service, i  dont  mind  fan  service  but  with  an  unexcusible  plot  with  it  just  unsatisfies  me. Its  very  cute and  moe  but  i  cannot  explain  why  it  bugs  me  after  reading  it.  It  has  a  wonderful  system  i do  admit  but  i  hope  in  the  future  people   will  not make  visual  novels  with  motion  in  it,  that  to  me  will  just  ruin  visual  novels  itself  for  me.  One  of  the  settings  for  it,  is  Chest Bounciness, which  i  find  absurd  and  amusing,  i  can  see  why  people  would  buy  it  because  its very  cute  and  moe.  I  did  get  the  demo  for  this  game  and  was  thrilled  but  when  it  was released  everything  was  off  for  me. There  is  barely  any  character  development,  but  so  far  this  is  just  an opinion. Though  the  characters  personality  is  good  and  i  like  it,  but  the characters  postures  and  tone  of  voice  sounds  weird  to  me,  its  not  flown  well  with  eachother.    I  want  to  spread  anime  love but  not  like this, i  feel  like  the  anime  community  is  just  silly  and is  known  well  for  its  perverted  fan  service,  fan  service  isnt  bad  but  too much  gets  in  the  way  of  the  plot   thus  making  it  look  bad. This  game  offers  tight  clothing  and  a  lot  of  panty shots,  I  feel  like its a starting  point  for  motion  visual  novels.  I  believe  that  motion  visual  novels  wont  be  as  good  as  non  mottion  ones.  Ive  been  watching  and  reading  romance  genre  animes  for  almost  12  years.  I  felt  like  the  romance  in  this  novel  went by  too  fast  that its  unatural  and  has  no  reason  why  they  would  fall  in  love.  I  dont  know  how  the  main character  can  handle  2 l ove  intrests  either  nor  both  Vanilla  and  Chocola  can  deal  with  it.  My final  result  for  this  game  is 4.5/10  but  this  is  an  opinion  by  me  so  dont  let  this  encourage you  not  buying  the  game  i  say  try  out  the  demo and see if  you  like  it  or  not. (hey at least i didnt say it was crap, i didnt even compare to school days now that anime was an embarassment to all animes hehehe :p) I  know  most  of  you  will  not  like  this  review  but  stare  at  the cute  cat  maids.

"Short version: Short, sweet, and just fine.  Long Version:  I think for the price, it's a bit much. The entire visual novel is about 5 hours long worth to read (And this is the adult version, so cut out 30 or so minutes for the smut) so it's a relatively short for a visual novel, however unlike other VNs, every character portrait is animated with the use of programs like Emofuri (Where each part of the character is held in different layers and are warped to give the illusion of breathing and physics)  The game comes in English, Japanese and Chinese, which is a HUGE thing as this is probably the first Visual Novel I ever heard of that had a simultanious international release. There was no wait time between the Japanese release and the International release. (Even the adult version has English text in it, however expect an additional $10 from you and to convert that money to Japanese Yen)  [b]So what about the content?[/b] It's a short story. You will probably finish it in a single sitting. The voice actresses are skilled, but the main female love interests both sound the same when their have to raise their voices. The window is easily resized and you can mute some characters you dislike (I didn't do this, though I was considering muting the minor nameless characters)  That aside, I think the game is worth it, the content is definately mature, but a lot of the ""mature"" content seems to have a lazy excuse to occure. Buy it on Steam, buy it on Nekopara's website, either works. It's short, sweet and just fine.  Bonus points because the art was made by a artist known as Sayori who has had her hand in some eroge Visual novels in Japan such as: Phi Age's ""Owarinaki Natsu, Towa Naru Shirabe"" e-xtreme's ""Momoiro Taisen Pairon"" And least we forget Sayori's artbook ""Neko Works"" A supurb artist, who finally has her original characters see a visual novel.",short version short sweet and just fine  long version  i think for the price its a bit much the entire visual novel is about 5 hours long worth to read and this is the adult version so cut out 30 or so minutes for the smut so its a relatively short for a visual novel however unlike other vns every character portrait is animated with the use of programs like emofuri where each part of the character is held in different layers and are warped to give the illusion of breathing and physics  the  in english japanese and chinese which is a huge thing as this is probably the first visual novel i ever heard of that had a simultanious international release there was no wait time between the japanese release and the international release even the adult version has english text in it however expect an additional 10 from you and to convert that money to japanese yen  bso what about the contentb its a short story you will probably finish it in a single sitting the voice actresses are skilled but the main female love interests both sound the same when their have to raise their voices the window is easily resized and you can mute some characters you dislike i didnt do this though i was considering muting the minor nameless characters  that aside i think the game is worth it the content is definately mature but a lot of the mature content seems to have a lazy excuse to occure buy it on steam buy it on nekoparas website either works its short sweet and just fine  bonus points because the art was made by a artist known as sayori who has had her hand in some eroge visual novels in japan such as phi ages owarinaki natsu towa naru shirabe extremes momoiro taisen pairon and least we forget sayoris artbook neko works a supurb artist who finally has her original characters see a visual novel,NEU,0.7302861213684082

The plot isn't really there plus around chapter 5, it starts to feel like a porno (as in 'my-cat-is-in-heat-and-the-only-way-to-help-her-is-to-get-it-on-and-not-read-the-pet-care-book-i-bought-a-few-chapters-ago'). However, the characters are interesting and the sprinkle of humor and cuteness through the game is enough to make you keep clicking forward. Also, small references.   Gameplay wise, it's linear,there are no branching choices at all. You can replay previous conversations (as in replaying the sound) but not 'reverse' back to a previous scene. No option to start at different chapters. You can hide the text box to view the scene better though.  Music is nice and comfy. Fits the cheerful theme of the game very well.    Overall, the game is like a cake. It's sweet and fluffy, but it's not very filling.   Extra notes: - Twins don't mind sharing.  - It can be played with a controller, but once the game starts there is no button to access the menu. - Vanilla is best",nekopara is a cheerful sliceoflife story about you and the two catgirls who tagged along when you decide to leave the family business to pursue your career in cake making beautifully drawn and coupled with the animations and voice acting makes it one of the best presented vns ive ever played   the plot isnt really there plus around chapter 5 it starts to feel like a porno as in mycatisinheatandtheonlywaytohelpheristogetitonandnotreadthepetcarebookiboughtafewchaptersago however the characters are interesting and the sprinkle of humor and cuteness through the game is enough to make you keep clicking forward also small references   gameplay wise its linearthere are no branching choices at all you can replay previous conversations as in replaying the sound but not reverse back to a previous scene no option to start at different chapters you can hide the text box to view the scene better though  music is nice  fits the cheerful theme of the game very well    overall the game is like a cake its sweet and fluffy but its not very filling   extra notes  twins dont mind sharing   it can be played with a controller but once the game starts there is no button to access the menu  vanilla is best,POS,0.9652475118637085

This game pulls at your emotions as well as any other visual novel.  Even know it lacks in choice (Not counting the options menu) it is not said to need it being a novel.  This is a good way to make a story look the same to a mass which if was just text and no image everyone will  view the characters and such in their own way. I also normally have my text speed to a very high speed but I found  the game would stop at mid word or sentence to force me to take a stop or period allowing it to flow better and seem  more real. Other then that the door bell ringing easily changed the direction of the chat for latter and kept the game  from dragging on. Overall this game has been fun so far and the developers studied and the English publishers clearly   did not skip out or water it down. I truly do not care so much for the 18+ version however it would be nice to have all  content available but doing so keep me from having any problems and I think it could be given as a free DLC for anyone who wants but steam may not like that also. My rating is 10/10 which I would rarely give but they covered so many bases with it that I cannot find much of any flaws and even know this is just a story they sure did make sure you are getting your money for it.

Summary:  Nekopara is a visual novel based on the works of [Neko Works] which follows the lives of two neko, Chocola and Vanilla and their Master. They will go though a series of events which deepen their bond with their master.  Rating: 9 nyaas out of 10  Pros: - Neko grills  - Good voice acting - Deep story - Characters that actually move - Beautiful art  Cons: -Slightly generic background music -Censorship (XDD) -Lack of any user imput  My Review:  This game had me always entertain at every moment with moments of joy and sadness at times. What I enjoy the most out of this visual novel was its clear attention to detail with each character's facial movements (also the bouncyness of a certain body feature *cough*). The story is great with the great scripting with each character having lines well suited and the occational joke with the character taken to account. If you are willing to just have a game where you do nothing but read this is the game.

"First off: if you're bothered for it being an all-ages edition, go get the R-18 version at DLSite. It costs 2160yen (around $17).  What has drawn me to NEKOPARA was, in the first moment, the art. Sayori's art looks so great, and I got really happy when I got notice that her circle, NEKO WORKs, was going to make a visual novel. I've had my eyes set on this since it was a Greenlight candidate, and F5'd my way to getting it as soon as it got on Steam (I literally refreshed the page a few times at midnight my time (6PM PST, the release time) so I could get the game ASAP).  NEKOPARA is a heartwarming story about a confectioner, Kashou, and the Nekos around him (though the story focuses on Chocolat and Vanilla, like on all of the NEKOPARA doujinshi by NEKO WORKs). It's a short and easy to read story that will have you giggle a lot, and feel warm inside too. I have to admit that Sekai Project's translation wasn't one of the best (as usual from them), but having played the game in both Japanese and English I feel safe saying that the translation doesn't kill the game's experience (and, the R-18 scene cuts can't be noticed at all).  If you're not looking for something with a serious plot and just have to take some weight off your routine, NEKOPARA is the right choice. If you plan on getting involved with a more complex and serious plot that will take up a lot of reading time, I suggest you go get something else, as this is NOT what you're looking for.  UPDATE: http://imouto.club/ddl/ has a reintegration patch (probably breaks Steam achievements, BTW) for the game to be really full, including R-18 scenes.",first off if youre bothered for it being an allages edition go get the r18 version at dlsite it costs 2160yen around 17  what has drawn me to nekopara was in the first moment the art sayoris art looks so great and i got really happy when i got notice that her circle neko works was going to make a visual novel ive had my eyes set on this since it was a greenlight candidate and f5d my way to getting it as soon as it got on steam i literally refreshed the page a few times at midnight my time 6pm pst the release time so i could get the game asap  nekopara is a heartwarming story about a confectioner kashou and the nekos around him though the story focuses on chocolat and vanilla like on all of the nekopara doujinshi by neko works its a short and easy to read story that will have you giggle a lot and feel warm inside too i have to admit that sekai projects translation wasnt one of the best as usual from them but having played the game in both japanese and english i feel safe saying that the translation doesnt kill the games experience and the r18 scene cuts cant be noticed at all  if youre not looking for something with a serious plot and just have to take some weight off your routine nekopara is the right choice if you plan on getting involved with a  and serious plot that will take up a lot of reading time i suggest you go get something else as this is not what youre looking for  update  has a reintegration patch probably breaks steam achievements btw for the game to be really full including r18 scenes,POS,0.9879142642021179

"NEKOPARA Vol.1 is the first in what I assume will be a series of short visual novels with the aim of making its readers melt with pleasure using a vast and varied array of female, feline, humanoid companions armed with cuteness and, well, catness. One of the first things I realized after starting the VN was that I was most definitely not the target audience for the title, which makes reviewing it a little difficult. While I personally didn’t enjoy the ride, it accomplishes everything it set out to do and does it reasonably well, so I’m going to attempt to cover both sides of the coin to give you an idea of whether this is a story that will appeal to you.  Minaduki Kashou has had enough of his family. Despite belonging to a long line of Japanese sweet makers, he would love nothing more than to open his own bakery, which is what he sets out to do. Just as he is about to complete his goal, however, he receives two unexpected guests in the form of his sister’s Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, couriered to him along with the rest of his luggage. Catgirls are, as they sound, female cats in humanoid form, with all of the cuteness you might expect from the mix. If taught well, they can speak and operate almost as well as a normal person, so in this day and age many people have taken them on as “Catpanions”. They’re a massive responsibility, though, and Kashou just isn’t sure he can handle the two while opening his new store. However, the Catgirls aren’t going to give up without a fight and Kashou may soon find a place in his heart and his home for the young felines.  If any of that summary doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, it isn’t. NEKOPARA is a dedicated moege (game intended to be cute) catering to a specific audience and doesn’t aim to appeal to anyone outside of that field. It spends all its energy on the simple goal of displaying cute characters doing cute things, which it does well, so if that’s your cup of tea then it would probably be a fantastic experience. Even though I’m more of a fan of titles with heavy story components I still found myself smiling and laughing during the experience, and I have to acknowledge that the Catgirls are pretty darned cute, so you can be sure that it would be that much more enjoyable to someone who’s into the genre. Speaking of story, there’s really not much to NEKOPARA’s. It’s short, sharp, and doesn’t try to do a whole lot except at the very end in a chapter that seems rushed and anticlimactic. In short, if you don’t think that Catgirls doing cute things are enough to hold up a visual novel on their own, NEKOPARA isn’t for you.  Characterization is as shallow as you might expect it to be, with the heroines showcasing a single personality trait each in addition to the necessary devotion to their owner. That said, there are a range of both humans and Catgirls involved in the tale, with a greater role for the non-main heroines looking likely in future instalments, which is more than enough to accomplish what NEKOPARA sets out to do. I want to take a moment now to discuss the VN’s classification, because it will be important for some potential players. The Steam release that I played is “censored”, meaning that scenes considered R18 have been removed. The odd thing is that borderline nudity, explicit talk about sex and obviously skipped over sex scenes are all still included in the final package. Given that anyone purchasing the Steam version is going to get all that anyway, if you’re after a cute, all-ages moege then that’s just tough, and if you’re after that stuff then why the heck would you buy the Steam version?  One of NEKOPARA’s major selling points is its visuals and they’re worth all of the hype. Character design is great and sprites will talk, blink, tilt their heads, walk around the screen and more. Allowing the animations to complete was a reason in itself for letting each character finish talking rather than continuing on after reading each line, as it gave a depth to the characters that their personalities didn’t. While most of the dynamic sprite features run smoothly, I noticed a bit of lag when the sprites change to new positions or poses without using animation, which was jarring and a little disappointing considering the overall polish of the visual novel. The voice actors perform as well as is usual for Japanese productions and the BGM is also standard fare. One final feature that I find really cool is that you can choose to play in either English or Japanese, which makes the game a great resource for people wanting to practice either language.  Summary – NEKOPARA Vol.1 isn’t for me but for its target audience it could be a lot of fun. The technologically impressive visuals mix with cute, fun characters to deliver a solid moege. If it doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, however, it probably isn’t, as it lacks any sort of compelling story or character development. It’s worth noting that the Steam release isn’t really “all ages”, so if you’re after something innocent then you may want to look elsewhere also.  My Score: 6/10 – Average Projected Score for Target Audience: 8/10 – Good",nekopara vol1 is the first in what i assume will be a series of short visual novels with the aim of making its readers melt with pleasure using a vast and varied array of female feline  armed with cuteness and well catness one of the first things i realized after starting the vn was that i was most definitely not the target audience for the title which makes reviewing it a little difficult while i personally didnt enjoy the ride it  everything it set out to do and does it reasonably well so im going to attempt to cover both sides of the coin to give you an idea of whether this is a story that will appeal to you  minaduki kashou has had enough of his family despite belonging to a long line of japanese sweet makers he would love nothing more than to open his own bakery which is what he sets out to do just as he is about  his goal however he receives two unexpected guests in the form of his sisters catgirls chocola and vanilla couriered to him along with the rest of his luggage catgirls are as they sound female cats in humanoid form with all of the cuteness you might expect from the mix if taught well they can speak and operate almost as well as a normal person so in this day and age many people have taken them on as catpanions theyre a massive responsibility though and kashou just isnt sure he can handle the two while opening his new store however the catgirls arent going to give up without a fight and kashou may soon find a place in his heart and his home for the young felines  if any of that summary doesnt sound like your sort of thing it isnt nekopara is a dedicated moege game intended to be cute catering to a specific audience and doesnt aim to appeal to anyone outside of that field it spends all its energy on the simple goal of displaying cute characters doing cute things which it does well so if thats your cup of tea then it would probably be a fantastic experience even though im more of a fan of titles with heavy  i still found myself smiling and laughing during the experience and i have to acknowledge that the catgirls are pretty darned cute so you can be sure that it would be that much more enjoyable to someone whos into the genre speaking of story theres really not much to nekoparas its short sharp and doesnt try to do a whole lot except at the very end in a chapter that seems rushed and anticlimactic in short if you dont think that catgirls doing cute things are enough to hold up a visual novel on their own nekopara isnt for you  characterization is as shallow as you might expect it to be with the heroines showcasing a single personality trait each in addition to the necessary devotion to their owner that said there are a range of both humans and catgirls involved in the tale with a greater role for the nonmain heroines looking likely in future instalments which is more than enough to  what nekopara sets out to do i want to take a moment now to discuss the vns classification because it will be important for some potential players the steam release that i played is censored meaning that scenes considered r18 have been removed the odd thing is that borderline nudity explicit talk about sex and obviously skipped over sex scenes are all still included in the final package given that anyone purchasing the steam version is going to get all that anyway if youre after a cute allages moege then thats just tough and if youre after that stuff then why the heck would you buy the steam version  one of nekoparas major selling points is its

"NEKOPARA is a thrilling story about the adventure of an up and coming Japanese confection maker, Kashou Minaduki, and how he struggles to make sweetie sweets and make his business thrive. In this sense, it is very much like Naruto because it is about how our main character overcomes the challenges presented to him. Naruto overcomes his curse and accepts his fate as a human.  Kashou overcomes the bonds of sexual taboo and dives into the deep depths of bestiality with catgirls.",nekopara is a thrilling story about the adventure of an up  japanese confection maker kashou minaduki and how he struggles to make sweetie sweets and make his business thrive in this sense it is very much like naruto because it is about how our main character  the challenges presented to him naruto  his curse and accepts his fate as a human  kashou  the bonds of sexual taboo and dives into the deep depths of bestiality with catgirls,POS,0.6761547327041626

"First off try the demo before buying. I did and it was the reason why I bought this. The game shows a follow tale of catgirls and their master. Now this game has a nice feel to it others don't provde. Like Live2d motion you have for the Ipad being instilled on this work. The characters move, blink, and react. They keep on screen and make good reactions with their expressions. The character work wasn't wasted. There is continuity and fluid movement. That is the heavy emphasis I saw. Nonetheless the tale takes a nice well drawn turn with many more introduced to the story. It goes on and out introducing more and each one showing their little bit of character. The two cats you have Chocola and Vanilla. These two are constantly in this story and have their interests with you. There are fun moments with more of the cast and the voices are synced. There are ways to change language just look at guides. Also the game supports English, Chinese, and Japanese Language with subtitles. The voice is what did well by it and the expressions I canot deny are cute. The telling of the story is good. OUT OF 10. This would be a 10. Thanks to the sense of this visual novel being able to give more. There is another version. However as of Vol 1. This thing hit top of my chart this year. Not a bad way to end 2014 ^_^ I enjoyed it.  If you get it now, I tell you won't regret it. This offered something other VNs lacked. Sure there's CG but you got to play it for yourself. I won't spoil it but it is good. The characters are all admirable in thier own way. Those who made it deserve the 10 as well kudos to you. Fans of this genre and game bro fist to you. Enjoy as I have ^_^",first off try the demo before buying i did and it was the reason why i bought this the game shows a follow tale of catgirls and their master now this game has a nice feel to it others dont provde like live2d motion you have for the ipad being instilled on this work the characters move blink and react they keep on screen and make good reactions with their expressions the character work wasnt wasted there is continuity and fluid movement that is the heavy emphasis i saw  the tale takes a nice well drawn turn with many more introduced to the story it goes on and out introducing more and each one showing their little bit of character the two cats you have chocola and vanilla these two are constantly in this story and have their interests with you there are fun moments with more of the cast and the voices are synced there are ways to change language just look at guides also the game supports english chinese and japanese language with subtitles the voice is what did well by it and the expressions i canot deny are cute the telling of the story is good out of 10 this would be a 10 thanks to the sense of this visual novel being able to give more there is another version however as of vol 1 this thing hit top of my chart this year not a bad way to end 2014 _ i enjoyed it  if you get it now i tell you wont regret it this offered something other vns lacked sure theres cg but you got to play it for yourself i wont spoil it but it is good the characters are all admirable in thier own way those who made it deserve the 10 as well kudos to you fans of this genre and game bro fist to you enjoy as i have _,POS,0.8194477558135986
