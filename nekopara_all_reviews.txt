My Choco and Vanilla are totes adorbs!, Chocola with her overflowing love and Vanilla just sticking to whatever Choco wants lol, Vanilla might be reserved but she's very funny with her teasing ^w^
If you have zootube premium and consider being santa in a mall a dream job not for the joy it brings to kids but to you, you will most likely enjoy it, if you are not perverted, lobotomized or some other way mentally ill, I doubt that. As the story progress it gets only worse and there is no hope for this series, just like there is no hope for this fandom
10/10, would chocola again.  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a masterpiece. The 18+ is not required to enjoy this game, especially with all the interactions between characters. Also nekos are amazing. They were definitely something I needed in my life.  All bow down to nekos. They are our lords who will free us from this mortal cage called life and give us all the salvation we need.
like WHAT IS THIS.
w game (there are some weird moments but im going to looks past all of them :>) i first played the game by itself before installing the dlc and playing the game with the dlc. let me tell you, this one sounds effect from the dlc IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! i really hope the sound is not in the nekopara 2 dlc...
catgirls and good story
I bought the game for story and I didnt thinked this game has hentai cus there was a dlc for 18+ until I saw bath scene atleast they were blurred and cutted scenes,game story not bad also animations are kinda mid, musics are good so I give it 7/10. Also whoever edge to this game may god help you
chocola is the cutest nyaa>.<
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a very short but cute and sweet visual novel. It is a kinetic novel that uses the E-Mote system much better than in some other works that I've read (notably Study Steady). It also features animated H scenes (there are 3 in this volume).  This visual novel is fairly bare bones past the E-Mote system. There's only a few BGM used, and not a lot of CGs are used. However, what it has it uses pretty well. I personally didn't utilize it more than a few times, but you can press "p" and see the characters on screen show off the "physics engine". It's full of cute scenes as well as a tiny bit of drama (nothing crazy though). I would recommend this visual novel to anyone who just wants a comfy relaxing read, or who has a predilection for catgirls in particular.
Masterpiece. Vanilla🥰
It was a pretty alright VN Wouldn't Recommend buying the 18+ dlc tho, not worth it even tho i got it for free Might have a friend gift me vol 2. or i might pirate it :P
nya meow meow meow nya
meow
i think kashou needs a restraining order
I played this game as a 14 year old because TheAnimeMan played it and I thought the art style was cute. I did not watch his full gameplay. Little did I know there would be BLOOD incest in the game and have it seen as normal. I heavily regret playing it and only 100% it because I bought it. If you are a minor, DO NOT PLAY THIS. This is an entirely gooner game.
[h1]Is this game worth it without the 18+ DLC?[/h1]  I would say so.  More specifically, I would say the game had enough of a plot (or at least a series of random though somewhat related events that appeared in sequence, but in a fun way) and the characters had enough personality to them to enjoy for its own sake, and there is some meaning to this besides [i]just[/i] being an excuse for naughty moments.  [h1]My personal random ramblings[/h1]  Enough of me pretending to be helpful to other players, now it's time for me to vent about my experience playing the game. You may as well stop reading here, because the rest of this review somewhat doesn't matter (though I guess it does mildly touch upon certain things that happen in the game, but honestly the main takeaway here is just "Playing without the 18+ DLC doesn't mean it's suddenly family friendly, it's just more like 17+ instead").  So, to start with, the way I even heard about this game in the first place was that occasionally I'll check old forum threads where people are recommending games in categories I'm interested in or I'll look through interesting curator lists and stuff looking for new ideas for games to play, and a name that kept popping up over and over was Nekopara, Nekopara. The title alone didn't seem that interesting at first glance, so I just ignored it, but the name just kept popping up over and over in different places, Nekopara, Nekopara, and this was mentioned far more than most games to the point where I finally decided to see what it was everyone was going on about, and I look and, eh, it's just some catgirl game, nothing that special, really.  Still, there's a demo, so I may as well try it out just to see what all the fuss is about, and normally I'm the kind of guy who plays a demo for 90 seconds and if the game hasn't captured my interest by then I just quit and move on, but this time I was going to take it super seriously because this was a big big demo in my mind, not just for this random game that the entire "young lonely anime obsessed male" population seems to adore, but also a demo for essentially the entire "Because you don't have a girlfriend, here's an anime girl instead" (not that I'm trying to be unkind to the playerbase here, but it's certainly true that I don't have a girlfriend and I played this game, and that should say enough) visual novel genre as a whole, because looking into the genre, a lot of other games looked vaguely as interesting as Nekopara but didn't have demos and so if what I assume is one of the most popular and therefore likely best games in the genre didn't seem interesting I'd just forget about those other ones too.  So, I'm playing the demo, and it's good or whatever, I guess, and then I get to the end (equivalent to the end of chapter 1 in the full game) when Chocola is telling generic protagonist that she wants to stay with him, and I admit I rather enjoyed that scene and I thought the backstory when the catgirls were younger was cute and I thought it was really really sweet the way Chocola loves her master so much, and, yeah, it was a bit heavy handed and they didn't have to say 700 times that these were her true honest feelings, but still, it was probably better to go too heavy than too light there and so I enjoyed it and so fine game you win and I'll wishlist you.  A little later I eventually get around to buying the full game, and I'm playing it without the 18+ DLC, and I must say my general impression with adult games (mostly because I'd heard about a couple of RPG's where it's apparently possible to do a pure run, but I guess maybe I shouldn't generalize that sort of thing) was that there will often be a choice to watch a naughty scene with little impact on the plot or just skip it, and I thought I had even noticed a point in the demo where such a choice might occur, because there's a point where the catgirls are asking generic protagonist to take a bath with them and he says no without any input from the player but I had figured at the time that maybe if you were playing the full game and had the 18+ DLC you'd have the opportunity to say yes there for a naughty scene if you'd like, and I just figured the whole game would be like that with mostly normal goings on interspersed with random smut occasionally, but then actually playing, uhh... no, that's not the game at all, and the smut is baked into the main plot here and most noticeably a whole big thing is made out of the catgirls going into heat and desperately needing a partner as a flimsy excuse for generic protagonist to say "I guess it can't be helped" and heading off to satisfy them, and without the 18+ DLC we don't actually see this happen but the game just skips to them lying in bed afterwards, but it's still implied, and honestly it was personally a bit of a disappointment for me because I'm the kind of guy who when they care for a character wants to see them stay pure and innocent, but at least my girls seemed happy about it, I guess. I just hope generic protagonist continues to take good care of them.  More than that, though, I was surprised by how much stuff made it into this game even without the 18+ DLC: There's a scene of generic protagonist washing off the catgirls after an incredibly forced situation to get them dirty that any idiot should have seen coming a mile away and that generic protagonist should have known to stop well in advance, but my point is the girls are totally naked here and there's a full illustration for it, and, yeah, due to the angle and some convenient steam and stuff nothing "interesting" is visible here, but it was still really hot and I enjoyed it anyway and I still wouldn't want my mom to see that image as my desktop background.  Also, there's weirdly a scene of one of the catgirls, well... "having a good time by herself", let's call it, and I have no idea if that scene might be more explicit with the 18+ DLC or something, but as I saw it, there was no special illustration or anything but just the usual character model with its arms extending beneath the bottom of the screen suggestively and some obligatory moaning and whatnot, but that was still more than I was expecting here.  Also, there's a scene of two of the characters talking about reproduction, which mostly centers around plants, but one of the characters is getting way too into it and drooling at the thought and stuff anyway.  Random thing, but generic protagonist's little sister kept making weird inappropriate comments to him, and it wasn't a major element to the story and I don't [i]think[/i] she was serious, but I still thought that felt weird, not just without the 18+ DLC, but just in general because although I realize that we who are into brother-sister stuff are not an insignificant group in the lonely young guys community, I also realize that there are plenty of people who aren't and such a taboo tends to be rather strong (not to mention she's specifically referred to as a kid at least once), and so I thought it a strange choice to include that in the game for such little reason and potentially alienate some of the players who were just here for the totally normal human on animal action (seriously, a fairly big deal is made about how catgirls are seen more as cat than girl, and I noticed in the Japanese text at least once them being referred to with a counter for animals, and it seems strange to me that if you wanted to have relations with catgirls that you would do so with a mindset that focuses more on the cat than on the girl) rather than the somehow less normal brother on sister lack of action (because for the record, generic protagonist isn't into the stuff his sister says, but he'd rather she knocked it off).  Also, there's a gratuitous double panty shot.  Anyway, near the end there's a scene where the catgirls are threatened with arrest while trying to help their master, and I thought their dedication to him was sweet there too.
Disgusting p*do stuff. Additionally: 18+ DLC costs extra (for the disgusting p*dos out there), game is old af (quality of disgusting p*do images is bad), you get nothing for your money because the game is just bad (there is not a single story changing decision you can make. Actually, there's no decision AT ALL).  Don't buy. I'm deeply ashamed I bought this a couple of years ago.
Smut for some, cinema for others... and we still await the final installment on Steam
The [b]wholesome[/b] experience
CAT!
Best Volume
This game to my own surprise had a legitimately good story line. A story about a man finally leaving home and starting his own business despite his families expectations of him. As he tries to leave his old life behind he is followed by his two former cat girls who stow away in his moving boxes. Despite the trials and tribulations that follow they all stay together as a rough family and work at the business together.  	The writing is legitimately pretty good for what it is. A cute slice of life story about a cafe with a whole family of unique cat girls. TBH I even teared up near the end.   	Oh... and there is a sex scene somewhere in the middle of that. Very NSFW. Take that as you will. The game is so good it would have been fine without it but it's there.
10/10  Wholesome and fun from start to finish! The characters here really stand out — none of that boring stereotype stuff you usually see in medium-tier VNs. The writing isn’t some grand masterpiece, but it nails its cozy, lighthearted vibe. Each catgirl has her own quirky personality that keeps things fresh and entertaining. If you’re looking for warm feelings and cute interactions, this is the one to start with. Buy the patch
It's okay, but there isn't much there, in my opinion. The story is really charming, but bland. There is very little drama or substantial plot. Worth a few bucks, but it's kinda boring. It's really good at what does though, so if you enjoy cute graphic novels with little seriousness, then give it a go.  Also, the trading cards are awesome.  Update: I have since playing found out that this is basically porn, which I didn't even know because I guess it takes like 12 hours to get to the porn. I regret ever playing it. Also, the value of the trading cards has drastically decreased.  Update 2: I didn't know about porn and stuff but like it's not intense or anything plus grils are cute I think I was just embarrassed about it as a teenager lol it's now my fav vn GET IT
the catgirlsare so cute!! I adore them all
Sex with cat girl
Catgirls...that's all we need
Don't fall into the goon trap, guys.

The cats are cute
Catgirls
Oh my god its Chocola
My favorite desert always was chocolate filled with creme~~
It's great if you enjoy visual novels with the option of buying the adult content so you don't miss out on the scenes. All in all a very enjoyable experience.
Chill game
life changing
very fun and cute to play.
*looks at neco arc* "Mom I want this cat!"  Mom: "We already have cats at home!"  The cats at home:
Less like a true visual novel in the sense that MC doesn't get any choices. However, this game has some of the best graphics I've seen from a visual novel, while it still being accessible in price. I do prefer the all ages version. H-scenes are quality (if you're into that) but they can be a bit ... much. Only got the DLC out of curiosity and for reviewing purposes. Overall, I really did enjoy it and recommend it. It's lighthearted and comforting to me, as I've been following the games for years and just now finally got to play it <3
in the la soleil cafe. straight up "jorking it". and by "it", haha, well let's justr say. my peanits
nice cute story
Redefined gaming.
THE JOKE IS PO-
NekoPara Vol. 1 marks a charming and polished entry into the main story of the series, introducing players to Kashou Minaduki as he opens his new pâtisserie, La Soleil. The narrative centers around his unexpected companions, Chocola and Vanilla — two energetic and devoted catgirls — who insist on helping him run the shop. What unfolds is a sweet and often humorous tale of affection, adjustment, and the growing bond between the characters.  Visually stunning with beautifully detailed artwork and fluid Live2D animations, Vol. 1 also benefits from excellent Japanese voice acting and a soothing soundtrack that complements its cozy, romantic atmosphere. Whether you're in it for the heartwarming story or the adorable interactions, NekoPara Vol. 1 offers a feel-good experience that's as relaxing as it is endearing.
This game is really help me healing. I love it
Is completely missing routes/choices, you have to pay $10 for each 18+ patch, each volume is extremely short at 1-3 hours long(depending on how fast you can read or if you skip certain parts), and maybe all of this wouldn't be so bad if the story wasn't extremely boring. Don't worry I was unlucky enough to buy all the volumes grouped on a sale, so I can safely say the story doesn't get much better in the later volumes.  Do yourself a favor and buy almost any other visual novel out there instead, better yet one that is well known for being good, unless you like catgirls to such an extreme that you're willing to overlook everything I Just said.
A very good visual novel, with optional R18 content.  The character design is colorful and vibrant, the voice actors make the characters shine, and the story is nice and easy - a game for having a soothing time.  Also, you can download an uncensored patch. (Which you might have to buy from the developers website, since it maybe is not available on Steam.)
I didn't expect anime girls to be so lively with movement feature! normally it's static, at least static in games I played in the past
Okay, so... I ended up having sexual relations with the cats...

absolute cinema (i ain't touching ts again, perhaps)
good game
Absolute cinema.
Vanilla is quite charming and funny... Chocola on the other hand I found annoying which is detrimental to the story given that you are surrounded by the two at all times.
Calling Nekopara a "game" is a stretch; simply put, it's an illustrated story you get to sit back and enjoy. Even as far as visual novels go, there's no choices to be made, and really not that much to do except click through the dialogue.  But, as far as the visuals go, it definitely delivers: the characters are all adorable, the artstyle is a treat, and the story is cute, fun and lighthearted. And of course, the H-scenes are very well animated, though you can choose to exclude those if they're not your thing.  A great purchase for cat girl lovers who live by the motto of "cute girls doing cute things".
Fun fact: Leaving positive reviews on hentai games ruins your friends' store pages by recommending it to them.
para
Yes.

NYAAAAAAAAAA
Catgirls are, again, a 10/10     Yet another 5-year-late review
Worth it, definitely should buy.
had some crazy discord goon sessions streaming this to my gf buy this if you and yo girl are freaks vro..
Death to this.
I don't like leaving negative reviews but I feel like I have to for this one. Strap in, It's a frustrated one.  For those who don't want to read the whole thing, I can summarise this [strike] game [/strike] Visual novel (Seriously, why does it not have the tag visual novel (as a main tag)):  [h1] Shallow [/h1]   I will be honest and say I don't like visual novels in general, so you might ask me why would I even bother buying this? Well, It was and still is popular and well liked, I did really like ddlc, and I like erotic material. I figured when seeing it in a bundled sale of all volumes that I might like it and perhaps that it could even change my mind on visual novels. REST ASSURED, It reinforced my aversion.  [h3] The good [/h3] - The voice actresses are good from what I can tell, but I don't speak Japanese so take that as you will. - I like the art. It's well made apart from 2 nitpicks that I will mention later.  [h3] The bad (not 18+) [/h3] - The story is so shallow. I guess the best way to describe the story is interpersonal relationships between the protagonist and the catgirls + sister. That is all. What does this mean for the story? Well, it means that there is practically nothing going on. When the story works up to something, the chapter ends and the goal has been achieved off screen. Phenomenal. - It's a visual novel, I know, but it should still be mentioned: there is 0 interactibility. None. Forget replay value, there isn't even ANY playing. - Any shallow or minimal conflict there is, will be resolved within max. 10 sentences. - The book is about 6-7 hours on auto-play (with 18+). Considering there is no reason to replay this or the fact that it is just reading, €9,75 is quite a lot to ask. SIKE, to get this full time you need the 18+ patch which costs ANOTHER €9,75 for a total of €19,50. - The story doesn't respect your time. What is told, could be done in 3 hours probably. - The MC is a dolt, I dislike him. - I know this is a nitpick, but hear me out. One of the painted backgrounds, the one that shows the front of the store, has an opening sign that states: 'opem'. There aren't many backgrounds, it's a simple word, the only focus for this product is writing, the art, and voice acting. Frankly, there is no reason to have such a basic mistake. - 90%+ of the story is just happy go lucky. (Maybe somewhat individual criticism, but it feels off)  [h3] The bad (18+) [/h3] - I hope you like bleeding eardrums, because that is the main 18+ experience. The exceptionally whiny and earpiercing 'wails' will drive you up a wall. Lowering your volume won't help due to the high pitch of the voice actresses. - From what I understand the dialogue is very much Japanese style... They want it but still will say stop, no and stuff... yuck. - Something that has always bothered me about hentai, let's describe literally everything in excruciating detail. They just don't know when to shut up. - I hope you like censoring. The good animated scenes are utterly worthless as a result, you can't even see anything (apart from nips). Honestly, just look up the 6 gifs online, it might even be a better experience. - I hope you like repeating sentences that are only minimally altered. (x4) - The official patch for the 18+ material is another €9,75! Are you out of your mind? To be honest, it's somewhat my mistake to think it was included. Yes, the game is practically known for the funneh 18+ stuff but let it be known, it costs extra.  [h1] To conclude [/h1]  I feel like my review was more articulate than the slideshow I paid for. Keep your money, it isn't worth the sweet catgirl tiddies.  There are enough of those and 100x better quality online for free.

banger ost
Nekopara is a super chill VN for catgirl lovers. The art style is adorable (those CGs tho ), and the characters are total sweethearts – their banter feels cozy AF. Voice acting slaps (JP dub crew rise up!), and the soundtrack is pure comfy vibes. Plot’s light but wholesome, like a warm cup of tea with extra nyaa~. Perfect for short play sessions or unwinding after a long day. Heads up: Some scenes might make you side-eye your screen if others are watching . Overall, a cute, low-stakes visual novel. 9/10 fluffiness, would recommend for slice-of-life fans
Catgirls
💗Chocola & Vanilla💙
not that great tbh
Good game 👍
The plot is uncomplicated, but it's easy to get achievements and complete the game. By purchasing DLC, you can have a good night alone, but not really...with your favorite catgirls, of course. I love cute things and kitties and all nekopara volumes ♡
I am drowning in cat girls uooooogh
Good story would buy the whole volume
I wish they were real.
peak!
The next time a dog person asks you why you're a cat person, present this game to them as your life's manifesto and then just try to walk away without spilling too much of your spaghetti before they shout out to everyone that yer a furry.
[h3] Nekopara Vol. 1 Review [/h3] Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Chocola and Vanilla ftw! (*ฅ́ ˘ฅ̀*)♡ This is my favorite series so far I had fun taking cute screenshots of the neko girls 💗  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950038703  Story and art is amazing! tbh I really don't care if it's NSFW lmao I like visual novels with beautiful food art period. 😽🍰  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950038676  IDK why I spent 17hrs on this game though I was probably AFK, a slow reader or busy doing screenshots lololol  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950038760
cheeky cat girls
I like cats a lot, but i dont know if i like them this way.... __________________ [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45534557/]Follow my Curator for more![/url]
This was one of my first visual novels growing up. It helped cement the fact that 1.) Anime girls > Real Girls and 2.) I like women. This game is not for the plot, but it sure is fun.
Hot
cats are pretty neat
This game is what it is. If you like catgirls, visual novels and mildly horny stories, this is probably for you? It's quite funny and the art is nice. It's not high art, but its fun.  Also, it's pretty good if you want to practice learning Japanese or Chinese thanks to the dual language feature. So that's something.
uohhh catgirl sex it's censored but it's STILL PEAK ahem, that aside, the story is really wholesome and I am definitely getting Vol.2
This game is very cute! A lot of people say that it's super creepy, but it really isn't THAT bad. Especially since here on steam, there's a safe version! We win! We win!
Very hardcore Souls-like game
CINAMMON BEST GIRL
Nice game Could finaly have sex with catgirl  10/10 would do it again
mmm catgirls

Lovable Experience -Very Cute game -Great 5 hr experience 10/10 would nya again
Feels like a slideshow sometimes but makes up for it in terms of the adorable voice acting, fluffy art style (and the H scenes). Character-wise it's a pretty common trope but well-executed - two lovely catgirls who can be airheads sometimes but they're the most loyal and caring companions one can ever have. Soundtrack is pretty decent, OP is meh but the ED is a banger  A solid VN overall and I'm looking forward to the other installations.
nya
pretty good
meow
Pretty easy to 100%, the story is very cute but as someone who bought this because i like cute stuff and not for well,,,, gooner reasons, the ''h-scenes'' are kinda of anoying and sometimes i dont fw the mc, but i guess theres also kinda yuri so that makes it peak
this shi will keep my mental health afloat
great game with high replay value  - least obsessed nekopara fan
[h1] Can be an Adult Game [/h1]  Nekopara Vol. 1 introduces players to a charming alternate reality where catgirls, or 'Neko,' seamlessly integrate into everyday life. These Neko possess human female bodies with adorable feline features like ears, tails, and subtle mannerisms. The story centers on Kashou Minaduki, a young man who departs from his family's traditional confectionery business to pursue his passion for baking. However, his plans are delightfully derailed when two of his family's loyal Neko, the energetic Chocola and the serene Vanilla, stow away in his belongings and follow him to his new home.  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a visual novel, meaning its focus is entirely on narrative delivery. Players should expect a linear experience with no branching storylines or gameplay elements beyond progressing the text and enjoying the accompanying visuals and music. The game excels in its lighthearted, slice-of-life storytelling, showcasing the endearing interactions between Kashou and the Neko. The narrative explores themes of independence, found family, and the challenges of adapting to a new life, all wrapped in a sugary-sweet package. While the premise is undeniably cute, it also sparks a degree of thoughtful contemplation. The game subtly raises questions about the societal implications of integrating non-human beings into everyday life, prompting players to consider the potential complexities of such a scenario.  It's important to note that Nekopara Vol. 1 contains suggestive themes and imagery. While the base game is generally suitable for mature teenagers, an optional adult patch is available for purchase, which significantly increases the explicit content. Therefore, a recommended age rating of 16+ for the base game and 18+ for the adult version is appropriate. Overall, Nekopara Vol. 1 serves as a delightful and engaging introduction to the Nekopara universe. Its charming characters, appealing art style, and lighthearted narrative make it a pleasant experience for fans of visual novels and those seeking a relaxing, feel-good story. It's a promising start to a unique and a new IP.  [h1] The game isn't an adult game without buying the adult patch from Steam or other ways. It doesn't change what happens in the game, you just see adult content. Honestly in the end, the adult content is just okay. It is still censored. [/H1]
my cuties......................... i love cat girls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SAME COMPARES FROM VOL 0 INSTEAD THIS ONE IS 1 AND MAKES ME EXCITED TO!!
cat
On Erdogan's soul this game is peak
fingers and toes have fallen off
[h1] A sweet, lovely classic, with copious amounts of spice! (8/10) [/h1] (• Played with R18 Patch)  Yes, this is 10 years old and I’m late on jumping on the train. But personally I still think it holds up quite well in most regards. If you want to start delving into JPVNs with romcom and SOL elements, and want to see what the fuss is all about, I’d say this is still a fine title to consider! Doubly so if you appreciate catgirls (you should, they’re cute) or maid uniforms!  I do feel like everything is pretty surface level in terms of how the relationship develops and how the story progresses, but from a technical perspective, this is a very well-polished game that focuses on having brilliant art and VA at the very least. The start can also feel a bit weird / wishy-washy, especially how cold and distant Kashou seems to the girls at times in the first few chapters, but I guess it’s there for the sake of character development.  It also felt somewhat formulaic, in the sense that MC ends up being nice a bit to a girl for a little sweet talk moment, then [spoiler]they go in heat and smell something sweet off MC as a sign.[/spoiler]. Happens to Chocola, then soon after happens to Vanilla. Of course, there are other story beats outside of this, but these two being strung together back-to-back made it feel slightly repetitive, on top of the fact that “[i]come on, anyone could literally say that[/i]”.   Of course, them being catgirls is the saving grace that might let me suspend my disbelief a little bit and assume they are clingy and easily attached by nature. And also maybe this obvious disbelief is why devs released Vol 0 AND Vol Extra; to give more substantial reasoning to the romance that unfolds here, since based on the synopsis of those, they felt like Chocola and Vanilla needed to be given more limelight.  The game also features Shigure, the somewhat lovestruck little sister/trainer/’other real owner’ of the catgirls. Her scenes are fun, but her existence makes me go “[i]another one of these, huh[/i]”. Despite my limited knowledge in this sphere I know how notoriously somewhat-common it is to have a sister chara who crushes on MC. And I know some people would rather [i]not deal with that stuff[/i] so I thought it’s worth mentioning. It is pretty fine here though, since everything is one-way and MC doesn’t indulge her too much. But looking at the info about the upcoming game “After”, it is somewhat likely that she’ll be a slowburn, final LI.  The end scene is pretty heartfelt, although I notice some odd details in how [spoiler]the cop literally doesn’t care that there’s a very sick dude being out late at night and needing help.. They literally said “[i]alright I’mma head out.[/i]”[/spoiler] Literally tunnel-vision and doing the bare minimum, but I guess that’s par for the course for background characters.  The epilogue also very rightfully teases the fact that [spoiler]other catgirls are moving in too[/spoiler], so I’m looking forward to slowly trying the rest of the bundle!  [h3]Information:[/h3]  [b](•)Playtime Total: 7h10m13s[/b]. I don’t cut VA and am generally not rushing. Took me 1h until intro video, 1:28:0 until Bath CG, and 3:14:29 until first H CG.  From my timings, the [b]H scene accounts for 2 hours exactly[/b]. ([spoiler]35m for Chocola, probably also ~35 for Vanilla, and 50m for final scene[/spoiler])  [b](•)Kinetic Novel.[/b]  [b](•)A tinge of Yuri.[/b] Yes, they may be “[i]indulgent, male-gaze-enabling[/i]” kissing art, but it’s technically there nonetheless. Although Chocola & Vanilla treat each other more like dependent twin sisters (as they are), they seem to really love each other.  [h3](+) Pros/General Ratings:[/h3]  [b](+) Writing (7/10).[/b] I mean it’s just slice of life so nothing mindblowing, but it was fun to read. There’s some okay worldbuilding too with laws, narration describing the population at large accepting catgirls as companions, etc. . At least it’s a bit more than the bare minimum.  [b](+) Godly tier art (9/10).[/b] People are here for the anime CGs, myself included, and it did not disappoint. Of course I’m partially swayed by the fact that lots of what I saw are H Scenes, but even if you’re playing without patch, there’s also some beautiful date CGs here or them very cutely eating cake. There’s also a lot of cut-in images that makes things decently expressive; more than I initially expected. I do wish we got a few more of the girls actually in the kitchen doing work, but it is what it is.  [b](+) Lovely girls (7.7/10).[/b] Chocola and Vanilla are very good girls. They’re very earnest, and the sense of distance Vanilla brings to the table actually intrigues me quite a bit. Of course, they’re also cute in their own ways. It does sometimes feel like they’re very simple mass-appeal charas though; but maybe simple truly is the best!  [b](+)Animated Sprites[/b]. Some of the pauses in movement can feel a bit awkward and dated, but the fact that it’s mostly animated is nice.  [b](+) Good Voice Acting (8/10).[/b] Yep. Not much to be said except nice production value. I don’t know much about who’s-in-what, but at least I noticed Coconut sharing VA with Ditzy Demons’ Miyabi (Tezuka Ryouko) and I really love her voice. [strike]Guess that’s why I gotta get in on the sequels[/strike]. Chocola exudes real lovey-dovey sweetness. The whole cast is solid really.  [h3](-) Cons:[/h3]  [b](-) Still some typos.[/b] Yep. Even for something [u]this popular and 10 years old[/u], there’s still a couple of lines with missing words and wrong words. Although it’s rare enough that I feel like it’s better than some other newer titles, but it’s surprising that this is the case, considering the current landscape of other non-JPVN games being updated and fixed for typo issues. Maybe no one cares to report them for JPVNs and I won’t either, but I’ve done my part for some other titles at least. I’d figure this was popular enough that some would surely have already done it over time, but I guess not!  [b](-) Text Display jank.[/b] Sometimes text just shows a single word for me and the line stops loading entirely or advancing. Bringing up the backlog in these cases show the full line, but going back to the line shows the incomplete one. Dunno what is causing this on my end but it happens, in both cases of previous line being advanced via auto-play vs manual clicks. I do often re-enable and disable it via the auto play button, and have different text speeds between manual clicks & auto play despite basically doing both depending on whether the current line is voiced or not, so maybe that causes issues, but it’s annoying how unpolished this feature seems to me.  I guess it was par for the 2014 time and my expectations are colored by more modern, newer-year releases feeling smoother in this regard. I expected something this beloved to differentiate between Auto mode Text Speed vs Auto Mode Wait Time (how long to advance once the line is fully outputted) too as an aside, but I guess back then no one realizes these two could be different sliders.  [b](-) Deleting save files just causes the game to crash.[/b] ??? “Invalid Value / Time & Date” prompt shows up before the game closes on me… my brother.. why is that even relevant. I have no idea.  [b](-) Steam Screenshots during the bath H-CG doesn’t show text even if you want it to.[/b]I guess some publishers do some special stuff during these to avoid getting into problem with steam formerly (fine); and hence do some kind of censoring in intent, but in implementation something ended up going wrong. The only thing that gets hidden is the actual textbox/backlog while fully showing the CG in full display.  Of course, the actual H scenes will result in pixellated screenshots and that’s pretty standard in my limited experience. But still an oddity how the bath CG differs.  [h1]Overall, pretty standard and I’d still humbly somewhat recommend it![/h1]
kusoge vol 1
Loved all the cat girls fucking eachother 10/10
cute VN series but ruined by gooners :/
Spent the playtime feeling so gross, the art is gorgeous but it can't make up for a story that first tells me these girls are only 9 months old, then tells me by human standards they're intellectually handicapped, then that the main character sees them as daughters and then just be chill with him fucking them. To top it off the rest of the story is such a boring lackluster moege that there's genuinely nothing of interest that could possibly hint at why this series became such an empire. I truly just do not get it.
Nekopara is a nice, wholesome story about the relationship of a young man and his catgirls.   Also has catgirl sex if you're into that. Censored with mosaic tho.
Great visuel novel about cat girls and running a bakery. Very wholesome. Has nice hentai scenes for the dlc and the base game is just wholesome. Art is good and all is fully voiced acted.
It's so peak
i wash i had catgirls to hang out with me.
The classic catgirl erogame VN. We already get to see every girl, but this volume focuses on Chocola and Vanilla.  Needs controller support, as there's no way to use the boob jiggle feature without pressing P on the keyboard, when playing with a controller.  Pretty decent technical and localisation quality for a VN, only noticed one typo and one achievement bug, no game script bugs or poor software, specially for a decade old game.
came for the cats stayed for the plot

Nekopara Vol. 1 is a visual novel developed by NEKO WORKs, serving as the true beginning of the Nekopara series. It blends an endearing slice-of-life story with high-quality artwork, fully voiced characters, and an immersive presentation. This installment introduces players to the heartwarming yet comedic life of running a patisserie with adorable catgirls.    Nekopara Vol. 1 Review (Steam):  ⭐Story:   The game follows Kashou Minaduki, a young pastry chef who moves out to start his own patisserie, La Soleil. However, two of his family's catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, sneak along and insist on staying with him. As he manages his bakery, players experience heartwarming, funny, and sometimes emotional moments with the catgirls. While the story is lighthearted and predictable, it excels in delivering wholesome and entertaining interactions.    ⭐Visuals and Art Style:   The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, featuring beautifully detailed backgrounds and expressive character sprites powered by the E-mote system, giving them lively animations. The character designs are polished and vibrant, making every scene visually delightful.    ⭐Audio and Voice Acting:   The game includes full Japanese voice acting for all the catgirls, making their personalities shine. The background music is relaxing and fits the cozy atmosphere of the patisserie setting, enhancing the overall experience.    ⭐Gameplay: As a kinetic visual novel, Nekopara Vol. 1 has no choices or branching paths—it’s a straightforward narrative experience. However, it does feature an interactive "petting system," allowing players to interact with the catgirls, adding a bit of engagement beyond just reading.    ⭐Replayability and Value: Since there are no alternate endings or choices, replay value is limited. However, fans of the series may revisit the game for its charming story, cute characters, and relaxing vibe. For newcomers, this is the best entry point into the Nekopara universe.    Final Score:   - Story: 7/10   - Visuals: 9.5/10   - Audio: 8.5/10   - Gameplay: 7/10   - Replayability: 6.5/10    Overall: 7.7/10    Conclusion:   Nekopara Vol. 1 is an excellent introduction to the series, offering a sweet and lighthearted story with stunning visuals and charming characters. While it lacks player choices, its immersive presentation and wholesome moments make it a must-play for visual novel and catgirl fans. If you enjoy cute slice-of-life narratives, this is a great pick!

Absolute Cinema, would do any cats in this game
catgirls
I'm replaying trough the Nekopara series for the second time now, and I felt like leaving a more elaborate review to anyone that might be interested in giving it a try.  [b] Nekopara Vol.1 [/b] is the first slice of a Visual Novel series about life with catgirls (and also running a patisserie). Each volume (game) moves the story forward and focuses on a different pair of catgirls, and this one is all about Chocola and Vanilla.  Reading trough the VN you can expect a very fun slice of life story, lovable and charismatic characters, amazing art with lively animated sprites, a great soundtrack, a lewd-cute romance and even optional NSFW content (included on the paid +18 dlc). If you enjoy any of this stuff, I recommend this VN for you!  Note that this is a linear VN, meaning that you don't have any dialogue or action options, and also meaning there's no character routes, so just sit back and enjoy the reading.  The story is divided into 8 chapters, and if I have to explain them, each one could be compared to an anime episode. I personally found it enjoyable to finish a game session in the end of a chapter, and then resume playing in the start of the next one.  [b] Nekopara Vol.1 [/b] has a free demo that includes all of chapter 1, so you should at least give it a try!
Super cute game! Love the art style and the character development throughout the whole game :3
I was expecting "nyans" and there were a lot of them.... Too loud!
an awesome guide on how to run a bakery, 10/10! will try irl!
weird how they establish that your relationship to chocola and vanilla are that they are like your daughters and then right after you sleep with them, an interesting game to compare to other visual novels but only in a sense of what?? why do they do this???   the only takeaway is that the cat girls are really nice and if they left the relationship not sexual id probably enjoy it more...
vanilla my beloved <333
Can't let the lads know i fw this
My husband facepalmed when he walked in on me playing this during lewd scenes... and it made me proud

its actually pretty good i wasnt expecting anything special and life changing lol wtf nice
Speed-ran this shit, my arm hurts so bad. My arm muscles are on fire, but still 10/10 would run again.
this game changed my life donald trump please i pray make cat girls real
i cum a few times

awesome i guess
Catgirl > Real girl. fight me. get me a genetically engineered catgirl for all I care!
catgirl sex
its scientifically proven that playing this game increases your testosterone by 100%
great game about how to run a bakery
This is a game produced from god himself. This game has led to a multi year addiction and 1000s of dollars spent to please the catgirl god. All of the catgirls are perfect with great writing. This is an instant buy for the whole series. The graphics are also amazing along with the dedicated button to make the catgirls jump, making their "assets" bounce with them. 10 nuts out 10 buy this now and submit your life to them.
shut up woman. make me a sandwich
im not getting into heaven after this one
yes
A good visual novel game with a few choices. If you like visual novel games you will enjoy this series
I like catgirls
i have hit rock bottom
Hey, let me tell you, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is an absolute trip! If you’re into some cute catgirls and wholesome chaos, this is your jam. The art is chef's kiss—like, who knew a bunch of anime cats could be so... ahem... adorable? The story? Okay, okay, I’ll admit it, it’s a whole mood. I’m proud to say I played for the plot... for real. Don't @ me. It's sweet, funny, and lowkey heartwarming.  I got way more attached to these characters than I expected, not gonna lie. The banter is top-tier, and you'll be laughing, cringing, and maybe even getting a little emotional (yeah, I said it). It’s the perfect balance of absurdity and charm. Sure, it’s a visual novel, so not much action, but trust, you won’t care. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.  If you're here for something a lil' different, that doesn’t take itself seriously, this one's a winner. Grab it, enjoy it, and, yeah, I’m sticking with the "I played for the plot" excuse forever.
Coconut is bae, but still though, I am embarrassed that I own these games. No one will know I own them. Other then that, decent visual novel and cute cat-girls.  ★ Please check out my curator pages and my other content ★  ★[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/cuppa-tea] Regular Cuppa Tea Reviews[/url]  ★[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/latenight-cuppa] Adult (18+) Cuppa Tea Reviews[/url]  ★[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/steel-cathedral/images] My Classy Content[/url]  ★[url=https://www.instagram.com/steelcathedralgaming] Screenshot/meme image dump[/url]  ★[url=https://x.com/CuppaTeaReviews] Cuppa Tea Reviews Official Twitter account[/url]

lolis and cute catgirls... purr-fect vn nyah~
saw boobs
Beata Maria You know I am a righteous man Of my virtue I am justly proud  Beata Maria You know I'm so much purer than The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd Then tell me, Maria Why I see her dancing there Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul  I feel her, I see her The sun caught in her raven hair Is blazing in me out of all control  Like fire Hellfire This fire in my skin This burning desire Is turning me to sin  It's not my fault I'm not to blame It is the gypsy girl The witch who sent this flame  It's not my fault If in God's plan He made the devil so much Stronger than a man  Protect me, Maria Don't let this siren cast her spell Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone Destroy Esmeralda And let her taste the fires of Hell Or else let her be mine and mine alone  Hellfire Dark fire Now gypsy, it's your turn Choose me or Your pyre Be mine or you will burn  God have mercy on her God have mercy on me But she will be mine Or she will burn!
Perfect CirX game i would say

A very cute game with funny Catgirls  the story is very good, cant wait to play the next one.  The game kept crashing at the start but i figured it out, i had to run the game as Admin for it to work.  7/10
sex with cat
Nekopara and catgirls are the meaning of our lifes. 💖
Nice i like it
I got gifted this visual novel by one of my friends. After "playing" trough it I have this to say. If God did ever exist this is one of the reasons he left us. I will never touch this thing again and I would strongly recommend you wont either.
That's crazy that's actually crazy
my clicks per second has increased rapidly in hopes to get the game over with
好玩♥
cats
I'm in too deep now gotta get the bundle.  I do recommend.
I like cat girls!
i love cats
can sex all of the cat ladies
infinitesimally better then real women
SAVE ME FROM THESE DEAMONS IN MY HOUSE
MMMMMMM I love me some cat girls
coco is the only saving grace from this horror
For people like me looking for good plot, good writing, or at the very least good grammar then this is not the game for you.. of course if you're just here for the cute catgirls and don't really care about that stuff then knock yourself out, I do have to respect the sound design though, great music and voice acting.
cats
We all get a bit lonely sometimes and...well...some other things.
Hell no, This game is, you know, it's really something. Yeah so...  #1 The game. This video "game" is nothing amazing, the story is boring, the humour is very weeby. Now if you're like me (a chill bill) you might giggle sometimes, but the video game is truly garbage. I don't even know why I call it a video game, shit's just spamming spacebar and waiting for something to happen, I'll talk about the something later. So yeah this is the story after nekopara volume.0 which was also below mid, you bassically run a bakery the two main retards come in, and whole lotta shenanigans happen... Like.  #2 Gacha Life Heat. Yeah so this is where i wanted to finish as fast as possible. You see the so called catgirls are built like people, but they're aged like cats, GENIUS AM I RIGHT!?!?!? so what happened is when they turned like 4 years old or even less, they're started getting in heat, so since this game is a scam and you have no choices in a visual novel, guess what you do. Easiest answer ever... you fuck them, yeah i know great story. So what happens after... You... FUCK THEM AGAIN. HELL YEAH FUCKING CP. :CLAP_OUT_LOUD:  #3 Conclusion. Please do not invest in this. I personally bought this as a little corny joke, but it happened so that I'm an achievement collector, so you know... I played the games and I regret something. I will most likely finish the other games and hope that there won't be any CP no more.
I know these games are considered meme classics but selling the adult patch is pretty scummy.  Just go to f95zone and download the games for free.  I don't believe these developers deserve your money.
I LOVE NEKOPARA!
the amusement park fits--- hello???? they have no right being so pretty
NOT CAT GIRL TRASH, SORRYYYYY
This game isn't as freaky as people claim like relax
meow
boring. hot though.
Catgirls are the best :D
I love Vanilla :3
Nekos are love, Nekos, are life.
This game is pretty good
It was perfect right to the last minute detail.
Very cute, even more cat girls
why are you reading this   its cat girls with Jiggle physics do I really need to say more.   then cool I'm out
end my suffering
I played this a few years ago during my "Belle Delphine e-girl phase" (I was like, 15) and gave it a good review... I was wrong. This game sucks. Its essentially a perverted, incest, pedophilic, beastiality game that's "justified" just because they're kemonomimi. The design is cute but its a game for gooners, point-blank.
i don’t know why i originally bought this game, but it’s absolutely amazing (and now i’m obsessed with catgirls) i highly recommend buying this game if you like cute catgirls.
i continue to suffer for my sins
Cat girls and jiggle physics. Everything the burgeoning weeb needs!  The game is cute, pretty typical VN format, lighthearted background music, loveable characters, and again, jiggle physics. And an achievement just for discovering said jiggle physics.   If you like VNs, 18+ patch content, and catgirls, this one is definitely for you!
Story is bland and the porn is boring.  Read a good book like "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream" or "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy", not this.
Im simple man, i buy it because i like catgirl... And the story is good
i left my family my job my country and friends to play this game oh i love nekopara
By definition this isn't a game. It's more like an animated comic strip. I feel that this product being listed under games is misleading and should be sold as a simple animated manga. Also the rating is unfair. Nothing about anything I've seen would be considered 'Hentai'. While some of the conversation does discuss having sex the manga shows nothing inappropriate and aside from a few incestual comments from one or two characters the conversations are obscure enough to not be out of place. I don't think this is an animated manga appropriate for children, but I don't think it's engaging enough for adults. In all fairness I regret purchasing this.
I have been traumatised. I genuinely can't bring myself to relive any of that. It was just so... Horrifying. The first 4 chapters were nice but from the end of 5 onwards, I just wanted to bleach my eyeballs. This is borderline, I don't even want to say it, [spoiler]so I won't[/spoiler].
There comes a time in every man's life when he needs to look in the mirror and ask himself how exactly he got to that place. You have to truly reflect on the decisions you have made along the path that led you to the place of your final reckoning.  It's still not clear, even to me, why I bought this game. There's nothing wrong with it, with those nudity scenes it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize how damaged I and the rest of humanity are.  What prompted me to buy a game like this? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it? When I look into the infinite depths of my own loneliness, I see a pool of reflection. My face is not there, there is no face. There are only tears in that puddle, tears of shame, loss and confusion.  If it were up to me again, I know I would buy it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip the countless window prompts so I could get a single bite of the pornographic images that are available online. However, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I chose to purchase this game and dedicate hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and like time I fear never to find it again.  There is something broken inside me, something that desires sensations beyond my reach, something that moans every night knowing that there is no real princess, it is simply an illusion. In my quest to find meaning in this long life, I searched for the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop-up window on my computer.  I'm not sure what the moral of this review is, I'm not sure of my place within the universe, all I know is that no amount of virtual girls can cure the big rot that has plagued me I really need money for treatment...
Love this game and the ability to play the full version is amazing, thank you all so much, nekopara is my all time favorite collection, just wish you could make choices but regardless it is perfect. FYI full version with DLC NSFW but you should know that already haha.
I FUCKING HATE MYSELF WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS THING HOLY SHIT IF THE CIA HAD A NEW TORTURE METHOD THEY WOULD USE THIS AS IT, WHY ARE THERE CATGIRLS TALKING THEY SHOULD JUST BE SHOT FOR BEING MUTANTS. 9/10
Meoooooow~~~~~~Owner~~~~~/=w=\<3<3<3<3<3
12/10 plot, chocola is just like me and i will not clarify what that means
best $10 i've ever spent
I wish they were real
Aside from the erotic scenes, the story is really good.
I've been waiting so long to own this game!!! and now, that I have it!!!! it's so CUTEEEEE :3 hopefully one day I get to cosplay one of these cat girls
A reality show about some baker girls turned into gameplay-less Hentai... Thank God I didn't buy the following Volumes...
What the fuck am i doing with my life?  Edit: OH NO, HE ACTUALLY FUCKS THE CAT IN THE BASE GAME, ITS CANONICAL  Edit 2: Would play again, 10/10
guys im literally chocola btw
nice
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A HENTAI! But that didn't matter as the full game is apparently locked behind DLC. (According to the negative reviews.) It had like maybe 2 kind of nudity scenes, but nothing was showing. Bless my eyes!  I didn't know anything about Nekopara when putting it into my wishlist. I saw the cute character designs and that it was a visual novel. Was blind to the tags. My husband bought me all the Nekoparas on a huge sale. Wish I played and discovered how I felt sooner so my husband could have gotten his money back. I'm sorry, Kenu!  Now I know this game is not targeted towards me with it being a hentai. I'm not going to review the game for it's NSFW.  The Problems:  1. The story is very bland and dialogue wasn't that interesting.  2. Listed as a visual novel, but has no dialogue options. 3. The catgirls literally act like cats in a human body. Could be a hentai thing, but I don't feel the need to f**k my cat. 4. Voice acting was cringe when they tried to act like cats. 5. The lore of the catgirls being pets, but can also be lovers is disgusting. Basically you are owning someone and for pleasure while they also happen to be your pet (bonus point: they can't get pregnant either to add to the fantasy).  6. It seems like they were trying to go for an innocence approach for Chocola and Vanilla (the main catgirls), but they come off as acting like 8 year olds. I believe they are still underage even in cat years. 7. The MC viewing Chocola and Vanilla as daughters and helped raised them, but still has sex with them. Even thinking that after sex too! Pedo behavior.  8. When Chocola goes into heat, Vanilla pressures the MC to have sex with her. Even saying that catgirls can get ill if not satisfied during this time.  9. Little sister lusts hard after the MC. And letting the MC get frisky with her pets. 10. Why is having sex with your pet a normal and okay thing in this world?  Good things about this product: 1. Character designs are great. Especially the contrasting colors for Chocola and Vanilla for being twins. 2. Voicing acting was good when they were not speaking like cringey cats. 3. Backgrounds are very polished and nice to look at. 4. Dialogue is very easy to read. (But still uninteresting.) 5. The art is gorgeous and probably the best selling point.
My god this game is SO SLOW WHAT THE HELL MAN I JUST WANNA SEX THE CATS not READ CRAPPY DIALOGUE FOR 6 HOURS, YES 6 GODDAMN HOURS to get a SUB-PAR sex scene. Total trash, would rather blow my brains out than play this again.
“NEKOPARA Vol. 1”  Pros: Voice acting, drawing, animation, jokes.  Cons: Small number of supported languages.  My rating: 8.5/10.
Cats are cool
I bought this game thinking it was going to be really good because of the reviews. What I didn't know is that this is actually not a game. You'll just have to click and click to follow the story and that's it, nothing else to do. I respect others opinions about how great this game is, but this just isn't for everyone.
Cute cat girl visual novel with optional 10$ hentai DLC. Need I say more?
a good novel in its genre                                             ₍˄·͈༝·͈˄*₎◞ ̑̑
Haven't played nearly as much as the hardcore numbers here (I may get there oneday), but this game is pure fun cute and erotic cute and funny fun with cute catgirls 11/10

Fucking great game, 10/10 would buy all of the volumes
Important entrepreneurship lesson for early startups and aspiring young business owners in general. The game introduces various lessons where you learn decision-making in business as well as managing employees' relation
I kinda knew what I was getting myself into but it still caught me off guard just how creepy this visual novel is. The way it was written it made it really hard to follow it for me and I could obviously not get into it.  Also the play this game in English and Japanese achievements are switched around for some reason.

Who the fuck thinks of this shit?

Where to start, without the dlc, it is wholesome, funny and emotional at the same time from start to end, with dlc things go wild but vanilla flavour mix to it. Man what a feast to my eyes seeing vol 1.
catgirls
This is where the catgirl addiction started
EZ
This review is for the whole Nekopara series on steam.  Pros -great art -extremely moe -decent voice acting -cute slice of life story -little sister has a brother complex  Cons -no decisions / story branches -auto mode sometimes skips multiple lines of text -bad pacing -the split into multiple volume means entering your settings every volume and CGs are split between different games as well as paying for each volume including the three different paywalls to the H scenes -each volume is short enough to be read in one sitting -cant romance the sister  There's really not much to say about this. It was a good time reading it but there were no decisions basically making the save menu useless. This makes it feel like a shit manga with voice acting and awkward character animations. This game is pure moe trash which i love but if i'm paying for moe trash i want more out of it like in other visual novels with branching story lines or like in the neptunia series where you get a full game and moe trash. If i wanted to read and look at cute anime girls i would read manga (for free).   Worst of all there is no romancing the little sister and no little sister H scene. This is the offence that caused me to write this review.

cool
Very amazing product, would buy again! This is perfect for my tactical game mindset. Please make Nekopara: After. :+1:
I regret nothing.
My relationship with this visual novel is very complicated.
Love it <3
LIVE, LOVE,, LAUGH, NEKOPARA
Obviously cute cats and such, but oh my god it's so fucking weird PLEASE do NOT support the creator by purchasing this shit game
I'm glad the h- content is optional in these games. The nekos are way too cute and way too young looking for me to want to ruin with sex.  Why buy the game then? Sometimes I need a break from a difficult game that is whooping my ass. That's when I buy a visual novel to relax.  If you are like me, give the game a chance.
this game is peak
Back when I was 16 I recommended this game but now that I've matured I just cant, save your money and buy a real game.
Such a lovely game. Really fun if played together with friends and family. ♥ Also, it has a JoJo reference. 10/10
this game cured my chronic depression
catgirls 10/10
Very cute visual novel, that's a lil sus 👀

10/10 seggs with catgirls
09pm  I am a 54 year old mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my daughter, who is now 15. My daughter recently started Nekopara in less than a week, she had already played for over 12 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my daughter, as she is always out with her friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my daughter since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought my daughter and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories! 😊
awesome mode activate
great plot. 4/5.
Vanilla my beloved
ok so first, I didn't go into this game thinking it was a porn game. I genuinely thought it was just a visual novel. So, I'll be reviewing it as one.   The Pros: the art, voice acting, and design of the game are put together very well. The art is super cute (besides the lewd stuff which is super nasty imo)   The Cons: HORRIBLE writing. Genuinely the characters are SO annoying, the worldbuilding makes no sense either. AND not to mention the incest shit?? You have a little sister who's obsessed with you AND you're like the father of the catgirls? But you have sex with them?? It's just so messed up. Gross sex shit aside, it's near impossible to actually play the game. I can't get over the oddly worried dialogue. It's so hard to read.   So in conclusion, if you're kinda weird and looking for a solid sex game, go for it I guess? But, if you're looking for an actual visual novel please stay away.   SUPER funny game to gift to a friend tho
以为是猫娘主题的模拟经营游戏。。。结果居然是galgame啊！！！！！我说怎么导入剧情这么长结果快进了老半天全是宅男幻想内容（）真的很有误导性啊！！！还以为是要经营蛋糕店，模拟经营爱好者震怒啊！！！！！！！！！！！！！（）
Degen game for degens. I am one of them.
Felt like a lot more cat girl interactions in this one and I am here for it.
This game is too boring , the only value is getting cards .
I was but a humble gooner, and after playing this game I can comfortably say that ive gone from gooning noob, to gooning PRO. Ive decked out my setup with 6 8k monitors all so I can goon at maximum efficiency, this game was my gateway goon. Ive purchased several gooning contraptions, all with varying levels of SUCTION. I love to goon, and if it wasnt for this game id be stuck a mere level 1 gooner.  I implore all of you to explore this game and unlock your true inner GOON.  Goon on brothers. Sam, gooning out.
猫娘+萝莉=xp
This game is the absolute peak of fiction. Nothing can ever, or will ever be released that will top this masterpiece of a series. The emotions that pass through ones body as they play through this game can not be replicated, and the colourful and whimsical nature makes it appeal all the more. The design of every last one of the characters is perfect, and shows their incredible dynamic with each other through typical tropes that all play off of each other incredibly well. This series has given a new lease on life and has shone a new perspective on how stories in fiction can be written. I will create a review for each game, and talk about the main characters in each separate game, starting with this one; Vol 1.  Chocola: Chocola is one of the two poster catgirls for the NEKOPARA series, and her personality is built to shine in that role. Chocola is outgoing and ditzy in nature, being the second youngest of the Minaduki Household, Chocola is shown to lack a sense of direction, and blindly follows her intuition, heart, and of course, her Master. She is presented as one of the deuteragonists of the series along with her sister, Vanilla, and together they wreak havoc day in and day out. She is not very good at dealing with complicated matters, and tends to lean away from serious topics with quick topic changes and feigned ignorance. Those around her perceive her as clumsy and uninsightful, when she is instead a strong willed and inspired catgirl determined to help those around her. Chocola was abandoned at a young age and taken in by Kashou (MC) & Shigure (MC's Sister). The character development from her starting as a scared, young soul, and developing into the shining star catgirl at La Soleil is a great decision, as she takes over co-lead at La Soleil. Throughout the games we are shown time and time again why Chocola is so strong willed and is always willing to fight for what she thinks is right. Chocola's go with the flow attitude makes her shine in almost every major plot-point throughout the series as she is not afraid to speak her mind, even if she isn't the most insightful while doing so. Chocola is a happy-go-lucky catgirl who even when sad, can be swung by a simple change of scenery of topic, although she is capable of being genuinely sad at points (As shown while they try and convince Kashou to let them stay at La Soleil). While she most definitely loves her sister, her love is not as outwardly displayed as Vanilla's to Chocola which is a nice contrast differing from both of their character's normal styles of interaction. The two later entires that come first in the series, Vol. 0, & Extra both help expand on why Chocola loves her Master (Kashou) so much. They detail how he helped them settle in to the Minaduki household and made them feel safe by taking time out of his days to spend with them. The story of Vol. 0 follows Chocola trying to cope with not being able to see her Master as much, as he is working on his Patisserie skills. This plot-point, while developed later, does help tie up lose ends to the story as to why they wanted to follow Kashou to the point of shipping themselves in boxes across to his new shop.  Vanilla: Vanilla is simply amazing. She is Chocola's identical twin, and almost all of her personality involves being exactly that. She follows Chocola as if it her job, and her only goal in life is to make sure that Chocola is happy, while staying with her. The two twins of the Minaduki household could not be more different in nature; while Chocola is energetic and upbeat, Vanilla prefers the more laid back approach, while still maintaining similar tastes as her sister. Similar to Chocola, Vanilla does not like serious topics, but chooses to use quick witted humour and distraction tactics as opposed to feigning ignorance to avoid such discussions. She is often portrayed as the more responsible of the pair, and always seems to be in the right place at the right time. As she is Chocola's twin sister, she too was taken in by the Minaduki household after being abandoned by their previous owners. Having such a similar upbringing to Chocola makes them share a lot of similarities, but their personal tastes and styles could not be more different. Chocola's happy go lucky attitude starkly contrasts Vanilla's sharp wit and "I'll do things my way" style of living. The want for independence but strong need to be next to her sister makes her the most "Catlike" of the 6 main catgirls. Vanilla's nature extends to how she acts, even around her family. She struggles to express emotions and maintains a monotonous voice throughout every entry of the series. This causes her to be often misunderstood as she is quite intelligent and oftentimes makes the most realistic comparisons and insights. The later released Vol. 0 and Extra versions continued to explain her complex backstory, showing her intelligence stemming from a young age, although she was not as prevalent as most of the other catgirls in those two entries.   In Conclusion the two poster catgirls of NEKOPARA start the progression of character building in this series, and start incredibly strong by giving each their moments to shine, and also knowing when to take steps back and let others shine in their desired roles. NEKOPARA is a one of a kind game that has stood the test of time, and even improved in both storytelling and art with their newer entries.  Pt 1/4
i feel like solid snake trying to play this game with family around
I thought this was a baking game
Good visual novel, ancestor cry .

it's so intense... x//w//x
this game soo vanilla, play it and relax and don't think about anything
Cutepiece!
i don't want my friends to know i played this
I played this game 4 years ago. Back then my understanding of the English Language was quite limited. So I see the game as just innocent words and texts.   I'm replaying it now to see how much I've improved, I can slowly put empathy on what I read. And whatever I read here is questionable.   Gotta respect the graphics and the music. The storyline used to be OK, but what I read now, a little uncomfortable, but fine I guess.
I think it's alright
great game, played it on on switch and wanted to get it on PC 10/10 cute catgirls
im so lonely
La primera entrega de Nekopara. Si hubiera terminado acá hubiera sido bueno, pero le sacaron la leche a esta idea como la Chocola se la saca al Kashou
I bought it cause i thought it would be a funny thing to do but I just felt creepy playing this
chocola and vanilla <3
very sex. best ever, made me nut in pant, 100/10 would again

What is there to say that hasn't been said? bit weird the relationship between Kashou and the catgirls but weebs'll get their rocks off to anything. I liked this one hour long video about the oppressive society of these games though

Big fan of this game, I won some project sekai giveaway for a bunch of porn games once lmao
Lovely story game
So I'm only on chapter 3, so I will update when I get further in the game! I'm gonna make this a serious review though, so.  Here's the things I like about this game so far: - The sprite art is really cute (Usually, will elaborate later) - The game has cat logic down to a pretty solid degree. - It's pretty cute watching Chocola and Vanilla going around being Chocola and Vanilla. - The other art in the game is also very pretty, from backgrounds to CGs and outfit design. - *Great* use of onomatopoeia everywhere  Here's what I don't like, though: - Major ambiguity on Chocola and Vanilla's ages. I get it that they age differently than both cats and humans, but the ambiguity between whether they're adults or children is way too major at times. - Kashou often says that Chocola and Vanilla are like daughters or little sisters to him, which feels weird considering how the game wants you to sexualize them. - Kashou often infantilizes Chocola and Vanilla, which feels weird sometimes when they act younger. - The sprites are really well done! But sometimes when Chocola's eyes go wide when she's looking at you head-on, she looks *really* uncanny. This is usually not the case when Chocola's head is at a 3/4ths angle. Sometimes when Vanilla looks to the left at Chocola when her head is at a 3/4ths angle, her eyes look like they're looking in two different directions.  I'll mark this review as recommended, but this game really isn't something I would recommend to just anyone. Maybe if that person can overlook the weird age ambiguity and dynamic between Chocola, Vanilla, and Kashou, then maybe, but I dunno.
A wonderful and adorable visual novel experience that’s worth much more than the price you pay for. Extensive plot, excellent voice acting and top-notch quality art. Definitely recommended!
100% speedrun, no guides, 08:07:56 (rest of the time added was so i can write the review :3)

Cute and sweet kittens causing all kinds of mischief. They are very needy and always hungry. They also coax you to take them places you can't afford.

Chocola is adorable.

[h3]TLDR at the bottom for those who respect their own time.[/h3]  I'm a huge sucker for all things cute and the art for the Nekopara games is adorable!  The plot however..? [i]Eh...[/i] The relationship between Kashou and his catpanions really could have used more development as there's hardly any chemistry between them (literally the only reason they end up in a relationship is because the catgirls go into heat, like that's pretty much it.) I feel as if the characters never got to grow, both as individuals and in their relationships with each other, it's a bit of a shame, really, but maybe that's not what NEKO WORKs was trying to accomplish, and that's okay. Still, i was hoping for that "Oh thank GODS they finally kissed!" moment, which i was left a bit disappointed, as i'm sure it would have very much enriched the overall plot and enhanced the [i]"plot"[/i] scenes.  Speaking of... the ""PLOT"" here is of fine quality; the art is stunning and erotic af, the music suits the mood, and the voice acting really sells it (No other comments, easy 8.5/10 macaroons.)  Also, can we talk about the music? Like yeah yeah it does it's job of setting the tone for the game rather well, but tracks like Cat Work and Nya Soliel are straight up bangers! Great for easy listening and perfect for vibing to while snacking on your favorite pastry. (also also, there's a titty elasticity meter, do with that as you will but it's not really my kind of thing lol.) Still was hoping for a more romantic edge, but I enjoyed Vol. 1 a bit more than I thought I would... at least enough for me to move on to Vol. 2!  Thanks for your time dear reader, and farewell!  [h2]TLDR:[/h2] The [b]plot[/b] is good, but the actual plot could be better. The music and art are lovely and cute, [strike]also I love Maple and Coconut very much![/strike] I enjoyed my time at the cat cafe, and i feel like if you're reading this, there's a chance you will too!
this game has traumitized me
By recommending this game I am fucking with my friends’ recommended.

Bought this years ago and didn't get past the first few chapters. They were quite boring and there seemed to be little to no plot. Now returned to it and it was worth it. Honestly it got better towards the end. Not sure what they were going for in the first half. I'm not a fan of visual novels, but will definitely be looking into the sequels (and anime adaptation). ·This version doesn't have +18 content by default, and you need to buy the DLC. I checked the cut parts online and personally I don't think they are worth doubling the price. ·The language achievements between Chinese and Japanese have been swapped, and people have had trouble with them apparently from 2017. Doesn't seem to have other bugs or problems.
Very good game about catgirls. Despite appearing on the surface to be a light hearted and cheery game about catgirls, it actually does a good job establishing a dark world where the catgirls are an oppressed slave race. I assume that the following installments in this franchise will delve more into this and eventually culminate in the catgirls being victorious in a slave uprising. 10/10, great set up for war arc.
Ik heb geen excuus waarom ik dit heb gekocht, maar er zijn hier tenminste schattige kattenmeisjes.

THE PERSONA 5 MAKOTO NIJIMA FLASHBACK IN NEKOPARA???
Cute cat girls, nothing else needs to be said play all the games, buy figures, live on the streets with your figures because they just keep coming out with more and not paying rent means you can buy more of them!
this is what the unabomber tried to prevent

[h1]This review was written by [/h1] [h1] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44830234-Hot-or-Not-Reviews/] Hot or Not Reviews [/url] [/h1] [h3] If you liked this review, make sure to give us a follow! [/h3]  [b] NOTE: My playthrough was played with the NSFW DLC! My gameplay experience therefore may differ from yours! [/b] [b] See my review for the Nekopara Vol 1. NSFW content [/b] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacie/recommended/947650/] here[/url].  🔥HOT🔥 Nekopara Vol. 1 is a japanese voice acted visual novel (English, Chinese, Japanese subtitles) which is the first entry in the Nekopara series of visual novels. This game follows Kashou, who opens his confections shop after moving out of home. Little does he know, when unpacking boxes he finds two of his families catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla. Despite his best efforts, Chocola and Vanilla stay in the shop and work together to run the shop.  The game has 7 main characters (Excluding the MC) which are introduced at the start of the story, being the two catgirls who are the focus of this volume, Chocola and Vanilla - alongside your sister Shigure and her four catgirls, Cinnamon, Coconut, Azuki and Maple. Shigure is the only character besides Chocola and Vanilla who appears multiple times throughout the story. Shigure's catgirls only make two appearances, one for introduction to the characters and the other for eluding the second game's [spoiler] introduction to the rest of the girls working at the cafe, Patisserie La Soleil (Nicknamed Neko Paradise at the end of the VN.)[/spoiler]. This game took me 2.5 hours to read, although for a slow reader can take about 5 hours to read. The game has adjustable text speed which also allowed me to read faster, with using both auto and manual reading at just shy from the fastest text speed.   Without getting into spoilers, the game focuses on the relationship which forms between the two cats, Chocola and Vanilla and their backstory, obtaining bells (simply catgirl citizenship) alongside their relationship with Kashou. The game also slightly delves into some of Shigure's story - although this isnt fully explored. The artwork for the game is very high quality, having both opening and endings (with their own unique songs!), scene segway cards and CG's. The writing for the game is quite standard for a visual novel, using words you'd expect for an anime style VN, nothing outstanding in this department.   Overall, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a high quality visual novel which with it's lovable cast which gets you invested in their stories and high production quality in bot it's SFX & artwork, I can certainly recommend this for both visual novel novices or experienced readers.
its ok...
Sex animation. Cute catgirls. Funny sex lines. 6 catgirls out of 6.  By which I mean, I totally haven't gotten the patch downloaded like a car, I just heard from a guy who heard from a guy. Still the absolute best male fantasy of being loved not just physically, but on all mental levels as well. And baking.
If you like visual novel, buy this game. If you want to try visual novel, buy this game. If you want to play with one hand, buy this game. If you like cat, buy this game. If you are gamer, buy this game. If you are not gamer, buy this game for your friend or your family member. If you are human, buy this game. If you are not human, buy this game for your owner or tell your owner to buy this game for you... Finally if you are someone or something or even nothing, buy this game.
Cats.
Wholesome adult game about cat girls and their master. 8/10 game.
holy ass
what the hell
I wish women were real.
This is the best game ever
creepy
Silly cat women so silly fr fr
this game is the start of every single problem in my life since i discovered it a decade ago.
cat
can i leave it in the middle, cause i need a cleanse after this. 申し訳ないが、このゲームは悪い意味でクレイジーだった。後半の章では本当に顎が外れたよ。他のゲームもこんな感じだといいな.
despite being a nukige, this release has you pay extra for the 'dlc' being the explicit scenes and content. without these scenes, the entire plot progression of nekopara is a complete waste of time - i do not recommend the steam release for this reason.
It's a cute little story, but the other games get better.  It feels a little obvious that this is a "volume 1", kind of like with Light Novels.   It hooks you in, and it's an enjoyable story.   It wraps up OK at the end, while also leaving you wanting for more.   It even has DLC if you want that xD
cringe
Played it for a little bit, it's only okay
NYAN nyan nyan nyan nyan... NYAAAAAAAAN!!!!!  Nyan nyan nyan nyan nyan. MEOW MEOW MEOW!!!!
Does anyone know how I can hide that I own this game?
it's alright
This game is wholesome and wonderful, yes it is an 18+ game about catgirls, but its in no way all there is to the game, they have constructed deep lore that makes this world feel lived in and unique, the romance storyline is top notch and I find myself genuinely caring with the cast and for those worried about the "censorship" the dlc is super cheap and removes all of it. I highly recommend any romance lovers check it out, censored or uncensored.
Cute cat grills!
i love me some catgirl cheeks
very great game my profile picture says what its done to me
oh my god its so bad. its so fucking bad.
I didn't actually play this. My friend gifted it so i sat afk for 2 hours so he couldn't refund it. Also this is disgusting, fantasizing childlike cat girls. Absolutely foul.
Fun
help i cant escape the spiral into downfall. i've almost bought every game and i cant stop.
I love cats.
Not catboys
Fuck kashou all my homies hate kashou
fun for the whole family.
among us
this cool game fixed the relationship with my imaginary girlfriend!
cats are the best :3
Cute catgirls doing cute catgirl things. If you're even reading this review, then you're clearly already interested in catgirls. Either that or your looking at the reviews to laugh at people that buy and play these. Either way I'd try to catch these games on sale.

My favorite part about the game is when Vanilla looks at Chocola and says "You are, NEKOPARA Vol. 1". Then Iron Man shows up and recruits them both to join The Avengers. The peak fiction writes itself.
bad unless your into lolis (ew)
Everyone should watch/Read, its a awesome story of catgirls and there cat-panion 10/10
still haven’t finished yet
an absolute waste of time the adult content dlc is for volume one not the other five and they'er censored a waste of time
Meowww :3
title speaks for itself  10/10
heh this made me nut 100 times xx
I feel so conflicted and also, why can't they be real?
you adopt two abandoned kittens raise them  hire them as waitresses in your cafe (their pay is accommodation and that you're hung like a horse) sleep with them and then save them from being arrested  a true masterpiece 10/10
Great game
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a very good visual novel game with a beautiful story about cat girls. The graphics are nice and the soundtrack is Chill and relaxing... I don't usually play this kind of game but the NEKOPARA's series are amazing. Highly recommend!!! 💗💗💗
purrfect
Nya~
I don't want to fuck Chocola and Vanilla I want to adopt them.
fun social war game. team based.
please send dude
This needs to be real
where the tism started  gazillion meows outta ten
Characters, plot, music, visuals and animations are all very nice buy it and get the patch too you'll love it trust me!
I guess its good
NekoPara is like cotton candy; It's big, colorful, and sweet. Then you take a bite and it's like there is nothing there, but it's a pleasant nothing. So you take another bite, and another, and another, and then it's all gone. In the end you find yourself all sticky, embarrassed for what you have done, and wanting more (although you would never tell this to even your closest friend). That's NekoPara.
CAT SLAVERY SIMULATOR 1 is a very good game !  DO NOT FORGET : This two cats is 9 months old ! And you can get the 18+ patch for free online if you are poor like me...
bro where is seggs they lied to me man
Liked it. Im not a furry.
jiggly bewbs!!! :3
0/10 tried to make me think sex was real
A softcore porn visual novel that takes over 3gb of space on your hard drive.

Look, don’t think too hard about it.  Nekopara is a kinetic (linear story) visual novel featuring a lot of cute cat girls with about a length of 6-7 hours.   The story itself is fine, there were some good moments in it but no way is anyone actually playing this just for that. The art / visuals on the other hand are great and is definitely what carries the series. Voice acting is good as well, they do a great job with their characters. As a special mention, I really liked the UI / menu design, it fits the theme and is easy to navigate.  If you like cute things, great. If you like catgirls, even better. If you feel ashamed at yourself by buying this remember, there are over 22,000 reviews on this game here on Steam as of writing this. It doesn’t matter if they’re all joke reviews, that’s still a lot.  If you end up enjoying Nekopara, more power to you. I know I did and I’ll definitely be playing the other volumes in the future.
catgirls.
What the hell was I doing. This was not a good decision to play. I love this game though! 10/10
I played this game for the lore
No one reads the reviews, so I will write that I am gay.
My fantasies will always be dreams. 10/10
Go get you this game and 100% it if you have nothing to lose.
very emotional and good story...

One of the best stories I've ever seen. Evangelion ain't nothing compared to this as this is a true narrative masterpiece the fact Vanilla isn't real is the reason I'll never be truly happy in life and never really satisfied by a woman please Vanilla become real
any chocola haters can fight me to death

Before I played this game, I had small boobs, no boyfriend and only a faint will to live. None of these things have changed, but this game is pretty good!
Nekopara is the kind of game that you go into feeling ashamed for purchasing and leave just happy to have seen cute cat girls. The overall story is fine, but Sayori's art is what makes the Nekopara series in general worth playing. I recommend the DLC, but fair warning that this game is the most vanilla of them- all other DLCs get a a bit wilder from here if memory serves. Enjoy the cat girls and don't think too hard about it!
I bought this game a while ago with no lewd intents. I don't think it had the hentai tag back then. Else, I missed it. Nearly 10 years later, I still don't feel like it has any sexual appeal, to me at least. Probably because I read it first as an innocent teenager who only liked the design of neko-people and bought everything available related to them. Though, I do understand why there are so many kinky reviews down there.
cat girls goo purrrrrrrrr
this is a visual novel where your 2 catgirls you raised guilt trip you into letting them live with you because they followed you after you moved out because you make their uterus' tingle or something idfk how females work ive never been touched by one in my life   man just take my god damn 10/10 thumbs up and suck my dick a million times   I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE
A CLASSIC
An old classmate gifted me this game as a joke and didn't expect me to actually play it.  Indeed! Never played it but I still racked up a shitton of hours just to prove a point to him.
luv game hehehehe
Cat
I wish I could meet them in real life so I could violently murder them with joy
HOLY MOLY. this game is absolutely mind blowing. everytime i play it, i feel like these catgirls are in my room with me and they talk to me. they always tell me how im the best master and how they love me so much. i love my little catgirls and i love opening this game so that they can be in the same room as me. sometimes my mom ruins it. she comes into my room and yells at me, telling me to take my meds. but everytime i take my meds, the catgirls disappear from my room. its been a whole year since ive taken my meds. the catgirls are starting to tell me to get rid of my mom. i think i might do it. im not schizophrenic. the catgirls are real. they are talking to me right now as im writing this review. overall, the game itself is pretty buncheeks, i only play it so i can talk to the catgirls. if i had to give it an honest rating, id say 3/10, pretty mediocre. all i want in the world, is for my mom to understand me and the real love ive developed for these catgirls. im always thinking about them. a week ago i got fired from my job because my boss said that apparently i was "talking to myself while staring at catgirls on my monitor" which wasnt true. i was just entertaining my catgirls while at work. I have no job. i dropped out freshman year, my family hates me, i weight 600 lbs and im 5'2. but its okay. because my catgirls LOVE me and they always will.
Cat goes "meow"
Legally? It's questionable.  Morally? It´s disgusting.  Personally? I like it.

Super cute , I like how the sprites for the characters not only are able to move but they are are able to get closer and more far from the screen. It feels like they have depth in space of the location setting and not just a flat 2d world despite being 2d spites . I also like the voice acting. It’s nice . Cute anime cat girls doing silly things .
I like cat girls.
booba
As a fan of cat characters, I enjoyed this. Very cute!   ...There is this one song from the OST that reminds me the Adams family theme btw lmao
I am not a pedophile
great for one handed play i recommend it
Imagine getting your account hacked and losing all your friends you made to this meme of a game, along with every review, screenshot, and artwork also being deleted. Couldn't me be lol. Anyways here to remind you we getting closer to that 100k milestone.
good soup
game's fine
meow meow meow :3
You know what you came here for, and you'll definitely get it.
This maid me rethink my life
Bought as a joke while on sale, had a lot of fun with it! Def got my 6$ worth, but I would definitely pay full price if I could. Would 1000000% recommend on sale or not!
God is Dead. I Killed Him Only Nekopara Remains.

nice game
i may have a problem
The story of one dude who will bravely decide that, yes, he will have sex with his pet-daughters. (No but seriously, he likens them to his daughters multiple times)  This didn’t do it for me. I wanted to make sure I wouldn’t be missing out on anything so I sped through it, but I won’t be continuing.  There’s no meaningful character development, no choices at all (aside from whether to enable explicit content and how much to make the boobs shake in animations), and no conflicts. Also, the extras menu seems to be a bit broken (played on steam deck)  The real ecchi stuff doesn’t happen until chapter 5 of 8, so you’ll be waiting half the game for it.  This game caters to the fetish it was named for and nothing else. If you’re on the fence or only kind of like it, hopefully this can be the difference maker
What a cute visual novel! There are so many things I love about it. It's definitely not perfect, as I found myself extremely uncomfortable by the incest themes and the ethics of the ownership of the catgirls. However, the pros outweigh the cons for me. The music is one thing that really stood out to me. It's always an important factor in a visual novel in my opinion, but it really stood out here. The voice acting was also just so good! Additionally, I really fell in love with the aesthetics; the art style is very cute with detailed sprites (with animation that I don't often see in VNs that really brought the characters to life) and the CGs were simply beautiful. Also, the general bakery/cake and maid themes are so moe! Finally, I must praise the game for its UI. One thing I love in a VN is its ability to be customised to the preferences of the player and this game has a very good settings page, allowing you to adjust to your comfort. Plus the P button and bounciness setting was enjoyable  ^.^
i love this game so much i need all the volumes now

Eroge CENSORED to the limit. Censored to this extent its a completely different game than the orginal game. Even some non-sex scenes are censored, not to mention censored lines of dialogue.   At the same time Steam is full of degeneracy (can't write what I really mean because my review will be censored/I got banned) and its no reason for censorship.
I wish there was a neutral choice for this game so, instead, I'll follow suit for all the people that up-voted.  I can neither recommend for or against this game since it is one meant to target a specific audience. It would be a lie to say that I didn't make an ATTEMPT to read the plot and the story when this game came out. It is why this one, compared to all the others, has the most time. I can state that while the plot has potential, there is nothing inside of it beyond your atypical plot for other games of its nature.  I can confirm that the game doesn't crash if you hold down the skip button.  Vol. 1 only has an issue where the language achieves don't unlock despite swapping between the languages.  I can also confirm that I don't know what the hell I was thinking when I bought every game in this series....
i love cat girls
Came for the Catgirls Stayed for the Catgirls
Gift from a friend. The story was fine. The achievements were easy I guess? You can 100% it pretty quickly by starting the game, pressing J, C, P, and E on your keyboard, and holding control for a minute or 2. Not my cup of tea, but if you're obsessed with catgirls, maybe you'll like it...?
even god cant save me now
Nya~
Veni, vidi, veni
while i loved NEKOPARA Vol. 0, and even the demo for Vol. 1, i didn't like this game's full version.  one of the main themes seems to be suppressing who you are as a catgirl, which made me uncomfortable.  i enjoyed NEKOPARA Vol. 0 a lot more. including that you could pet them any time in that.  it's a shame. life can never have enough catgirl neko maids and i truly mean that, but unfortunately, this ain't it for me.
Masterpiece!
Nekopara is nothing short of a masterpiece that has profoundly impacted my life in ways I could never have imagined. From its breathtaking graphics to its compelling storyline and immersive gameplay, this game is a work of art that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming.  The first thing that struck me was the sheer beauty of the game's world. The attention to detail in every pixel is awe-inspiring. It's a place where you can lose yourself for hours, exploring every nook and cranny, and marveling at the intricate landscapes, from lush forests to desolate wastelands.  But Nekopara isn't just about visual splendor; it's about the emotional journey it takes you on. The characters are so well-developed that I found myself caring deeply about their fates. Their struggles and triumphs resonated with me on a personal level, reminding me of the strength of the human spirit.  The gameplay is a seamless blend of challenging puzzles, heart-pounding action sequences, and moments of quiet reflection. It's not just a game; it's an experience that forces you to think, adapt, and grow. It taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, problem-solving, and the importance of teamwork.
all nekopara games are just feeling comfy and nice type of games
i havent felt the touch of a woman

always nekopara, FOREVER NEKOPARA!

i love it
[h1] NEKOPARA: Catnip for the Curious, and Well... More! [/h1] Welcome to the whimsical world of NEKOPARA, where catgirls reign supreme, and the plot takes a backseat to, well, some purr-plexing assets! 🐾  If you're in it for the feline-friendly fun, this visual novel will have you questioning whether you're a true cat lover or simply an enthusiast of...round shapes. Yes, we're talking about the NEKOPARA characters' ample assets. The creators have clearly decided that the cats in this game got more than their fair share of milk because, seriously, those proportions are nothing short of awe-inspiring.  The catgirls themselves are a sight to behold, and not just because of their adorable ears and tails. NEKOPARA boldly goes where few cat-based stories have gone before, putting the 'ecchi' in 'meowchii.' The bouncy physics of certain anatomical features could easily rival a trampoline park – talk about defying the laws of gravity with a furry twist!  The narrative is like the catnip that keeps you coming back for more, weaving a tale of patisseries, sisterly love, and a generous helping of double entendres. But let's be honest, the real stars of the show are the characters'...umm, personalities. They're just so well-rounded!  So, if you're looking for a game that embraces the philosophy of "plot over plot," and you have a penchant for catgirls with, shall we say, impressive assets, then NEKOPARA might just be the purr-fect match for you. Get ready for a tail-twitching, head-turning adventure that's bound to leave you feline fine! 🐱✨
Cute cat girls.
this review is for nominating badge
I liek the cat.
It helps me to handle my depression better when I play this series.
Best first person shooter on steam
i think my zaibatsu awakened when i saw chocola on catnip. why was she doing all that for green shit? i dont understand and i feel like op should explain. i do not want to google shit in the middle of nekopara. the reason for this is because i have to suppress my emotions. my emotions are that i want to break chocola's nose. preferable with a metal bat. i do keep a metal bat next to the balcony, where i play nekopara. this would cause me to break my laptop with said metal bat. i may also hurt myself, as i do not wear clothes when playing the game. as a side note, nekopara has directly caused me to recieve police visits for many accounts of indecent exposure. i did feel bad as the game was immersive and did make me feel like i was apart of the nekoverse. i felt exposed when i was not wearing clothes and takoyaki cat was on screen. this is because she looks like a child, but it was ok because in those beady lifeless eyes i dont think she is seeing shit. therefore i dont think she is seeing my 2 millimeter defeater. but in all honesty, it did make me feel better when playing with pathched content because i felt like i finally had something down there. this is why to all my dear nekos out there i reccomend playing in vr. overall i would reccomend because for the 7.9 hours i have play this shit my confidence has went up 18%. i even went as far as being confident enough to play this in my local park. unfortunately, i am not allowed to be naked in my park either. this caused many controversy among my neighbors as i have received death threats from certain gun owners. this is okay because they will never be able to take my nekos away. anyways, i do reccomend the game ( again ). you should play it, and if you have enough willpower, with your clothes on.  mrnekodead out
Love the series.
i am hoeless

I love this game very much.
this game really makes you feel like a nekopara
Have spent most of my time looking at a single frame before realising I had to click to further the game, 120 hours wasted. It was easier figuring out how to play EU4 and beat it before I realised that I had to click. The next 104 hours were really hard as I could only play with one hand, please fix this and make it possible to have a one-handed mode.
Look. I gave this a shot because of the art, and I heard people like this series. I've played through most games now and I feel kinda bad. The art is awesome and the girls are cute. The game itself isn't horrible, but... it's the NSFW that bothers me a little. It's well made and looks great, but almost all girls act, talk and look like kids. Also, the main character's little sister is... questionable. [b]So if you like incest and girls who look like minors, this game is for you![/b]
Some negative experiences, you just have a speech lined up for. Because something wonderful or at least interesting was on the line, and you want to vent the loss of the baby with the bathwater.  But for Nekopara? This kinetic visual novel that has just taken Steam by storm?  It has been a while since I have met something that somehow manages to be so underwhelming and uninteresting and yet quite so disgusting. Such so, that I don't even feel much need to copy-paste most of the copious notes I've taken as to why this is one of the most noxious, revolting, dislikable pieces of trash I've ever entertained on my hard drive.  But let me share a few.  There are major incestuous themes or at least implications that go unpunished, even presented as wholesome or pleasant; the "catgirls" are *nothing* like cats - the things in this VN are way too friendly, loyal, and affectionate to have *anything whatsoever* to do with felines - and there is generally an atmosphere and worldbuilding core of abuse in glittery paint. Aside from the incest, or at least incest-coded interactions, these human girls with cat features are "owned", living as slaves, as living playthings, and it's played up as this wholesome thing. And the writers have the gall to try to push some BS that they're actually more cat than human, "because ears and tail." It's like an excuse for a right-wing political policy; so stupid and insufficient to allay the elephant in the room it's supposed to explain away, delivered so confidently and unapologetically it either forces you to go along with it or sickens you to your gut. Or both.  __  But okay, let's say you're kind of feeling in the mood for an "Arabamu" lewd setup and you think the Emancipation Proclamation was a mistake. Well, what's wrong with Nekopara then?  Plenty, frankly. The story is underwhelming and uninteresting, just a day-by-day with no evident stakes and it basically being anime people doing anime things until you get to lewd scenes. I'd be up for a slice-of-life, if it's interesting, but Nekopara isn't.  The characters themselves, which are supposed to be the meat of the experience, apparently, get redundant and annoying, really fast; their interactions and dialogue might be bearable, even sparsely likable, in a different sort of VN, but for a game wie're here for the lewds for and we know it? And one *THIS LONG*? They're just obnoxious and don't add anything interesting to the plot or social atmosphere.  Speaking of lewd? Perhaps the biggest outrage of all is that it's not even in here, by default. You have to pay the whole price of the VN again, just to see what is probably only two or three scenes that I bet I could easily look up on a seedy website if I wanted to. It's insulting. Yes, I dislike that the dialogue seems to be incest-coded, but if you're going to put that in a game you are expressly selling for its lewd content, at least have the stones to double down and put your lewd content in as part of the main, whole purchase, lock, stock, and barrel.  Oh, did I say game? Excuse me. This isn't even a game. It's a "kinetic visual novel". There's no option to interact with the story or characters in any way. This just plays in one direction, with the same outcome, each time. This is basically a porn video if you ever thought "gee, I sure wish these porn videos had *more* talking heads, had most of their action in subtitles, and that I had to regularly click to make it play instead of clicking the once and just watching" - oh, and where you have to buy the video, then buy it *again* to see the actual *porn* in it.  And for gosh sakes, even the worldbuilding isn't worth a dime. The aforementioned genetic excuse they pull out of their ass for the girls' being cats is just the tip of the iceberg. There are stupid rules about the arrest of these "cat" girls, a "family" of eight somehow surviving on a singular traditional candy shop...  For hell's sake, even though this takes place in a bakery, and the Kashou guy presents himself as being all qualified and set up as a proper baker, through and through, I am convinced he's a fraud. He calls a Sponge Cake batter a "dough".an eyebrow-raiser but forgivable.  But wrapping it up and saving it for later!? WRAPPING! UP! *SPONGE CAKE*! BATTER! and SAVING IT FOR LATER!? I am in an Advanced Baking course as I type this (just got back, a bit of a coincidence now that I think about it) and this is one thing we DO NOT DO WITH SPONGE CAKES!  ___  If this were some obscure niche VN tucked in Steam's dark corners, maybe I wouldn't feel this angry. But the fact this is so popular that Steam expressly merchandises animated avatar images and other things about it, and its pics are all over the place for anything to do with lewd games or sci-fi cartoon girls to date? That is insulting. There are a hundred games that deserve stardom more than this - NSFW and SFW alike.  If you really want to spend ten - or depending on how desperate you are, twenty- dollars on a frustrating ghost of an experience when you could buy much better ones for five dollars or see a much longer one for free, go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
has cats, very good
superr cuteee!! >w<
Gotta love cat girls
So cute
I`ve played through all of them, and as an overall review, I just Can`t get past many of the fetish-y moments, the family-relationship situation, him raising them since childhood, and literally getting with all of them, withouth you having any say in any decisions. If you don`t have the nsfw DLC they`ll just constantly talk about it. I just wanted wholesome MOE, and wouldn`t mind some ecchi elements but I just cant with this cursed game
I FUCKING LOVE CAT GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Peak. Nobody getting this close to peak ever again
many cats, game good
I LOVE THIS SHIT
if you think crying is not real and only CGI like i did, play this game
if your boob bounce slider is set to low, youre a coward
I thought this was a cute/cringey visual novel I could read with friends. Then it got creepy and r*pey and i realized this was NSFW in the worst way. Dude calls them his daughters, sisters etc before d*cking them down. One of the most uncomfortable experiences ever.   I dont like visual novels as is, but this was gifted to me and i never checked the store page because I am big dumb.
Just thinking about their lifespan makes me sad...huhu.
CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
NIGGA THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING ASS LIKE HOLY FUCK ITS A BOOK. THE GAMEPLAY IS HOLDING SPACE BAR. FUCK NO  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS SHITTY ASS GAME

its neko girls what else needs to be said xD
it's shit
Best game..
[h1] 9/10 [/h1]  Saya merekomendasikan Nekopara kepada siapa pun yang menyukai catgirls karena saya merasa bahwa meskipun ada kekurangannya, pengembang NEKO WORKS benar-benar tahu cara membuat catgirls.   Jika Anda suka memainkan novel visual dengan gadis-gadis kucing yang lucu, maka Nekopara pasti akan memenuhi kebutuhan Anda di bidang ini. Nekopara memiliki pesona yang bagus dengan seni yang menonjol baik pada karakter maupun latar belakangnya. Karena ini adalah novel visual kinetik, tidak ada pilihan dialog yang akan mengubah rute atau akhir permainan, jadi pastikan untuk meredam ekspektasi Anda karena Anda akan mendapatkan lebih banyak cerita dengan gadis-gadis kucing yang lucu daripada sesuatu yang akan terasa seperti sebuah game.
Gahdid!!!
Cats
I like big black men
People who only watched the anime: aw, what a cute and wholesome story. People who played the VNs: do they know?  [h1] Introduction [/h1]  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a slice-of-life visual novel, and it's the first of a series of four visual novels (excluding the prequels, Nekopara Extra and Nekopara Vol. 0). It even has an anime adaptation for those who want to check it out. Being a slice-of-life story, it isn't a plot driven story by any stretch of the imagination, but this means that the characters need to be likable at the very least. Lets see if there are any merits to this game.  [h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]  Surprisingly, the worldbuilding of this game is solid and consistent. The game is set in modern Japan, and has similar, if not the same, rules of the real world. The difference is that catgirls are a thing. As a side note, some people think catgirls belong to the category of furry, which is wrong. Catgirls belong to kemonomimi, which are human, save of the animal ears. The game describes very consistently the characteristics of catgirls, the rules to which they abide and their influence on human society. The only gripe I have with the worldbuilding is that those elements are described mostly through exposition dumps instead of dialogue that flows naturally with the story and the characters. Another thing I noticed is that the absence of catboys, because the game establishes that catgirls can get pregnant, but not through a human, so that means that catboys must exist, but they are never mentioned. Something to think about.  [h1] The plot (or lack thereof) [/h1]  The story is simple. It's about a pastry chef that wants to open and run his own bakery, in opposition to what his parents wanted, and a very peculiar kind of employees join him to work at said bakery. Then the story focuses on the relationship between the two star catgirls and his new owner. Overall, the writing is solid, but not stellar, but there is a plot hole at the end of the story in which a character says something that contradicts something they previously said, and that facilitated the drama that followed. The pacing was good and the tonal shifts were spot on. The dialogue is good overall, but... why dialogue during H-scenes is so cringy? I may never know.  [h1] The characters [/h1]  The characters of this game, save one, are static, and, in the context of a slice-of-life story, it isn't a bad thing. The thing that matters is that the characters are consistently characterized and need to have distinct personality traits. Note that the names of the catgirls are always of ingredients used regularly in bakery. There are in total six catgirls (plus one that is a side character), but the main subjects of this story in particular are Chocola and Vanilla. They are very endearing characters. Chocola is a catgirl who wear her emotions on her sleeve and it has a very upbeat personality. Vanilla is more subdued but her deadpan jokes and the way she conceals what she really feels is, like I said, endearing. Regarding the main character, Minaduki Kashou (he will become a very, very lucky guy), undergoes a small change, because he wanted to run his bakery on his own, showing his selfishness, but then he accepted the help of Chocola and Vanilla. Shigure, his younger sister, is a total brocon. I'll leave it at that. Overall, the characters, especially Chocola and Vanilla, are very likable characters, but Kashou can be a bit boring at times.  [h1] Presentation [/h1]  The art direction is in the middle of the pack. Not bad, but not excellent either. Character artstyle, though, is very good, whether be in event CGs or the animated models, and the animations are very well done, expressive and life-like, and the way the ears of the catgirls perked up or drooped based on their emotional state is a nice little detail, plus, it looks very cute. The voice acting is also very good, the music fits the tone and the situation nicely, and the H-scenes are also excellent, though I wished that the scenes were at 60 fps, because in every other situation, the game ran at the same framerate as the refresh rate of my monitor (165 fps in the case of my gaming laptop and 240 fps in the case of my gaming PC). The player can also change between Traditional Chinese, English and Japanese text on the fly. The game also gives the player the option to adjust jiggle physics. Nice. Push "P" to see the effects.  In conclusion:  [b] Pros: [/b]  -Soild worldbuilding, with small exceptions. -Endearing and likable characters. -Good presentation overall (including H-scenes)  [b] Cons: [/b]  -Some plot issues at the end of the story. -Main character can be a bit boring. -At 10 hours, is a bit too short for the price (base game and 18+ DLC).  So, all in all, the game has enough merits to earn my recommendation. If you expected good storytelling in this game, then you are looking in the wrong place. Slice-of-life stories don't need traditional storytelling, only cute and likable characters doing cute things (and some extremely lewd things in this case), and this game delivers on that regard. Also, the presentation is worthy of praise, but I strongly recommend to wait for a good discount on the base game and the 18+ DLC, so you can get more for your money.
i wish there was more feet
For weirdos only, Imagine showing this to a Roman councilman.
goro goro goro
Great for training one's mental fortitude. Other than that, suprisingly qualitative animation, when considering the other "still-image like" VA's out there. What I do not support, however, is beastiality.
Amazing quality art, animated high quality sex scenes, cutest cat girls, stories nothing special
Very good game, love from China 非常好黄油，爱来自瓷器 I highly recommend this game 我非常高推荐这游戏
one of the lines is "they feel like daughters and lovers". that should be enough
catgirls awesome
in the stripped club. straight up “jorking it”. and by “it”, haha, well. let’s just say.  my peanits
boobie
All the stuff that happens in this visual novel is so trivial that I've already forgotten what it was all about. But I can recommend it under two circumstances:  1. You're studying Japanese and need some cheap content with dual subtitles.  2. You're wondering how many "nyan"-puns you can make in only one game.
Be aware, once you get into nekopara you can never came back
This game ruined my life
Needs more catgirls
This game is absolutely horrendous. Pretty much any visual novel can be expected to be fetishistic an stereotypical, but this is a fine example of these issues. There are numerous instances where the dialogue suddenly feels extremely stilted because some sexual implication is brought up out of nowhere, and especially when mentioned by one of the more innocent characters, these jokes and impications feel extremely out of place. Obviously it's an ecchi/18+ game, but you shouldn't have to throw innuendos into every single conversation like that. Literally a moments thought about this universe's logic reveals how actually fucked up it is. I mean, you essentially OWN other human beings - or at the very least, sentient beings who are shown to be pretty much equally capable to humans given the right environment. There's also the extremely obvious incestuous obsession of the MC's younger sister, which by the way, they do no efforts to excuse, even specifically stating that she is A. blood related and B. quite a bit younger than the MC in another game. An speaking of age gaps, did i mention that Vanilla and Chocola are cannonically NINE MONTHS OLD? They also act basically like children, and it's clear from the dialogue that they have only recently reached sexual maturity, so they are probably 16 year-olds in human years AT BEST. In addition, MC also raised them and is said to veiw them like younger sisters. Literally how much creepier can you get? Oh right, they are also legally his possesions. EW. So yeah, this game is absolutely the worst I have ever, EVER played.  That being said, they are all incredibly cute and god i want their wardrobes so bad. This series is probably my guiltiest pleasure ever.  nyanyanya nya nyanya nnya nyan nya nyannyanyan nyan nyan nya nyanya! nyanyanya nya nyanyanaynya!!! NYANYANYA!! :3
AM I?????????????????????????????
me finks dis da best game i evr plaid uwu!!!!!
I'm suprised that i'm invested in the story
Meow. UwU  ♡
When I played Vol. 0, I made the joke that I had many unanswered questions regarding the existence and status of catfolk in this world. I fully expected it to just be glossed over or handwaved, to be honest. Now I just feel like a fool.  Imagine my genuine surprise when the mental checklist of out-there, absurd worldbuilding requests I planned to joke about was slowly ticked off throughout the game. Things like the view of catfolk/human relationships, the rate of aging, catfolk's status in society, whether or not catfolk and people can reproduce, etc. Why would a cutesy eroge bother even mentioning any of this, I thought? Hence why my absurdist review would mark that as a faux complaint. But it's all there, and as subtly horrific as it should be. And I love that.  In all seriousness, it's very cute. The ero scenes are whatever, I'd honestly say not to bother spending the extra cash on em if you're on the fence about it. Ultimately, though, it's your call whether you want this as a hardcore eroge or a cutesy romance story. I can respect the fact that it caters to both crowds.
Life changing experience
Help the horny catgirls have invaded my house they are demanding sex and I cannot refuse they are extremely persistent, Send more men there are too many to take on alone.
I-I can explain
This game sucks
DO NOT BREED THE CAT🧔
better than sekiro shadows die twice
I am eating Taco Bell right now, steak quesadilla, nachos Bell grande without tomatoes, and nacho fries with cheese, mild sauce, and Coca Cola soft drink
There are two kinds of people who will buy and play this game: Those with a guilty (and arguably a bit unhealthy) pleasure And those like me who want to suffer just for the meme of having played it  Playing this game feels deeply wrong and uncomforting to me, so much so that I was honestly frozen scared to even press the start button; I was even in a Discord call for my first hour, and that friend can attest I played that hour sounding dead and regretful as fuck 草草  anyway tldr solid game, definitely recommend for self torture or desperate pleasure

I played all the Nekopara games on steam and will be adding my review to all of them.   I love the Nekopara series, aside from the hentai, the stories are just really cute. My favorite cat is Cinnamon but honestly I love them all. The protagonist is a bit of an air head but he makes the scenes even cuter. Honestly, I would recommend buying everything from this series (or buy it twice like I did since I own these both on Steam/Switch lol).
no comment
yes
if i say i enjoyed this would i be in jail?
You can press P to make their boobs bounce
game sucks balls

Cat Girls in maid outfits wowie what an amazing experiencee!
I play Nekopara for the articles...
Nya
There’s no such thing as a lot of Neko
harder than dark souls
nii-chan is a preak
I think it is a well written storyline with lots of cute innuendos. I have gone thru the entire 21 hours of what I have.
Catgirls yes, recommended ! Lovee Chocola
He gets 2 catgirl to love him. NIce.
Great for learning Japanese

Good
Don't expect me to fawn over this game just because they're wearing cat maid uniforms and calling me GOSHUJIN-SAMA GOSHUJIN-SAMAAAAA
A VN that is pleasant enough and funny at certain points but very abruptly changes tones much quicker than expected. This is short so there isn't much time to provide depth to the characters and the story could've used some work for it to make more sense and have a better payoff.  For instance, there's a point where the MC is essentially on death's door and passed out in bed. The two catgirls run out for help and then get into a bit of trouble. Minutes later, MC has hopped out of bed, is perfectly fine to head outside, somehow goes to the exact spot the girls are at and ends up saving them. You can't tell me a character is at death's door and then, with absolutely nothing changing, suddenly have that character up and running around. It makes no sense.  Anyway, pleasant enough but needed fleshed out more.
Cats
for someone who just started playing this game, its SO good. i love all of the characters they are SO adorable. 10/10 would recommend to anybody bored!!
Nice start. Vanilla is my 4th favorite.
pretty neat
Wow nice physics, big boba
meh
Underage women stay far far away
I enjoyed it.
you dont get it, they are only 9 months old in human years
I got plushies of these stupid ass catgirls for 72 dollars, safe to say I like it.
可愛すぎる。にゃにゃ　:3
很好用，孩子很喜欢
cute cat girls  :)
Good. Love it!
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
This game has changed my life in so many ways. Before, I was happy, but I was losing some form of hope. I eventually decided to turn to NEKOPARA Vol. 1. Now, with my changed ways. I have a noose in my hand right now and I am about to kill myself, goodbye everyone.
I like visual novels. I like catgirls. I like boobs and sex and sexy things. This has nice visuals. There's even a  slider to control the amount of boob bounce if that's your thing.  I'm not in any way a prude.  But there's no actual choices or gameplay involved, its just a straight auto-playing game.  Basically an anime with no budget.  And that's fine, visual novels are what they are, not all of them need branching paths or illusion of choice. They hae a particular story to tell, its a novel rather than a dating sim.  That's fine.  What's not fine is the main relationship.  The two main characters are treated and aged like children.  They're mentally cats.  They're sisters.  They call the player their master.  The player character EXPLICITLY thinks of them as his "daughters". And then they have sex. It's just really gross.  Incest, pedophilia AND bestiality all in one package.  The story was kind of cute at first but then they started making long analogies about flowers having sex and then one of them being in heat and it just got really squicky.  I feel like I'm on a watch list now.
This game decreases my number of maiden touched.
Funny cat game.
Before I played NEKOPARA Vol. 1 I had a small wee wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression and absolutely no will to live. Now I still don’t have any friends, no girlfriend, I still have depression and absolutely no will to live, but at least I have big wee wee now.
as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. I am not gay. I just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked, she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. I have lots of sex.

Godly masterpiece 🖤 One of best VN ever created,like this purrfect whole series overall 🖤  Cute nekos are 🖤
Best for playing with friends
Well, Chocolate and Vanilla are so cute.
I somewhat wish there were a 'meh' rating here on Steam, but as it stands:  Do you like pretty anime? Do you like h-games? Visual novels? Harems, cat-girls or slightly animated sex scenes? If so, you'll probably like this game, which is really just a visual novel you read through. I do wish there were some more interactive elements to this game (choices like in dating sims or interactions with characters like in other h-games).   My issue is that the two main catgirls (Chocola and Vanilla) refer to themselves in the third person all the time and it annoys the shit out of me. Also, Shigure, as the main character's little sister is really.. a bit much. The rest of the catgirl crew is pretty neat and I do look forward to maybe learning more about them in future games. Hentai scenes are pretty nice, but due to Japanese law regarding censorship, the genitalia are censored, which is a bummer.  Favorite chapter of this is probably Ch. 8, which was endearing and contained no h-scenes at all. And the set up for the sequel was cute.
My parents are dissapointed in me Vol. 1  At this point I am slowly starting to forget how grass looks like
Hail fellow gamers, the name's Kiba Snowpaw, a devoted ice wolf from the frozen reaches of an ice world! Gaming for more than three decades now, with an anime and manga collection that can outshine any library's manga section, I'm here to give you my take on a game that's been sending chills down my icy fur. Also, let's clear something up first - I'm not a stranger to the "birds and bees", nor the "wolves and does", if you catch my drift. With plenty of action in the igloo (wink wink), this review, despite the game's nature, isn't written out of frustration or desperation. 😏❄️🐾  Nekopara has been on my radar for some time now. My experiences on Patreon, Kickstarter and Bandcamp, supporting indie developers' dreams with substantial investments, all funnel into my evaluation. This isn't just another notch on the bedpost; it's a passionate night with a new partner, a game that's opened up a new world of enjoyment.  Diving straight into the nitty-gritty, this game's an eroge, or an erotic game for the uninitiated. Yes, it does come with steamy scenes that might put the heat on my icy world, but that doesn't mean it lacks content elsewhere. As a hardcore gamer with a knack for an immersive storyline, let me tell you - Nekopara knows how to weave a tale.  You're in charge of a bakery and have the company of adorable anthropomorphic catgirls (referred to as Nekos) who, by the way, are wonderfully brought to life with exquisite animation. The game, with its captivating characters, pleasing music, and lively voice acting, does an excellent job of recreating the atmosphere of a bustling bakery. And, a little pro tip for my fellow eroge adventurers out there: there's a boob bounce slider that defies physics if you want it to. Just sayin'... 🎮🐱💕  Now, it's easy to get lost in the... ahem... physical aspects of Nekopara. But, let's not forget about the intriguing plot that pulls the heartstrings at the right moments. These Nekos aren't merely human-feline hybrids bred for amusement. They come with their own histories, dilemmas, and insecurities. The game's society deals with complex issues such as abandonment, compliance tests, and GPS tracking that add depth to this supposed erotic escapade. It's a unique amalgamation of dystopia, ethics, and human-feline relationships.  Given the darker undertones, Nekopara might make you question the reality of this seemingly utopian world. It's akin to a cute, fuzzy, and sexy version of Brave New World meets The Handmaid's Tale.  However, folks, let's remember that at the end of the day, it's a game, and a darned good one at that. I've navigated the plains of Azeroth, conquered the universe in Mass Effect, fought off the Covenant in Halo, and Nekopara stands proud in this illustrious company. Why? Because it does something different and pulls it off spectacularly.  There's a special place in my heart (and my Steam library) for games that offer something more than just mindless action or soulless erotica, and Nekopara is one of them. The art, story, and interaction all combine to make a game that's worthy of the hundreds, if not thousands, of hours you'll lose within its world. 🐾💗🎮  So, whether you're an eroge veteran like yours truly or a curious newcomer, Nekopara is worth your time. There are many worlds to conquer, quests to undertake, and catgirls to... ahem... meet, but remember: it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.  Stay frosty, gamers! Remember to always enjoy the game and embrace what makes it unique. This is Kiba Snowpaw, your furry friend from the ice world, signing off after another frostbitten gaming night. Until next time! 🐺❄️🎮  #FurryVerdict #KibaReviews #IceWolfGamer #Nekopara #StayFrosty  [Score: 100 Boob bounces out of 100 🐾🎮💯]
my entire family is disappointed in me
I only bought it because of steam achievements I swear
Yes Dad......I'm Winning
meow
not young enough in cat years
I like the aquarium part of this game :)
this has forever tainted my profile
It hurts when i'm touching myself
cats
cute cat girls\
One of the games that was worth of buying in steam I enjoy the game very well either with or without the DLC for the game
she left me..
Y'know, there are many things wrong with this game, like beastiality and the implication of having sex with something that doesnt have the same capacity of intelligence as you. I can very easily overlook these things, people from japan are wierd. But i fucking HATE Shigure with a burning passion. She very obviously has a brother complex, which is fine in of itself, but shes annoying and not very well written at all. anyone at a glance could tell Shigure wants to have sex with her brother, brother complex characters are not entertaining when theyre just annoying and feel no shame for their mindset. Also, the invasion of privacy. if someone wants to go live on their own, you respect that, you dont force their cat to ship you a business card. Shigure is wierd, shes invasive, she feels no shame, and she is the entire reason i refunded. i cannot express enough how much i hate Shigure
I hate the people that made this game
i kinda like the game bcs i love cats, but i just have to ignore the weird scenes. they are cats and probs minors thats just weird and disgusting. if you enjoy those scenes please get help. overall the game is cute and i like the artstyle but would be better without those scenes.
I never understood what all the fuss was about with this series. So I decided to give it a go. For one, yes the H scenes are great, pioneering live2d animations plus a decent dub. There are a few of those which clearly had some work put into them. The art overall is very cute, both sfw and nsfw. Apart from that though... its incredibly short, the story is meh and the music is garbage. I'm not going to keep on playing the others, though I see potential in here. Its a little cute meme game for teenagers.  IF you play this over your 20s you need to go outside.
god save me
why vanilla no banana?
guys this is scary (im scared of women)
i like nekos

I like books and novels I also like this novel and the anime And my friends should have this game or games like this on their shop
DLC very worth it
Nice game
The story writing is good for me. Without "That" DLC, seems like something is missing. Worth for storyline and yeah, I know, you know what I talk about XD. For my honest review, I recommend H##### enjoyers and Visual Novel enjoyers to buy this. Anyways, it's ok to wait until the summer sale or winter sale to come out
I Play this game because I like Cats. You Play this game because you have never felt the touch of a woman. We are not the same
Maybe the first visual novel I have played, so I know I might sound a little harsh and perhaps even biased, please excuse that. This game is mainly made to be enjoyed by anime girl lovers, and cat girls are a huge plus. This game can definetly make you one of us cat girl enjoyers, even if you were not very inclined towards them in the past (my case, used to despise them). The plot is a little weak, nor do I like the style of visual novels (if you like vn's this should not be an issue), but the cat girls are very much cute, and the anime girl cutie energy is there. The h-scenes follows the visual novel style, so if you do not like the art style this game's magic will not work very well, and it may feel slow and boring. To summerise, you like anime girls this game will work, if do not like vn's maybe avoid this game, the h-scenes are styled like vn's, so not liking vn's will make the h-scenes crap. Important: the h-scenes have to be bought seperately as a 18+ dlc, and also press p to make their coconuts jiggle in game. Overall this game is positive for me, Happy gaming my brothers.
Nekopara changed my life  After my wife left me there was a hole in my heart I didn't think I could ever fill again. I was no longer able to find joy in life, so when I first started up Nekopara Vol. 1 I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story. I was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over me as well.   This game managed to fill the deep hole in my heart. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this game. Nekopara Vol. 1 truly changed my life, perhaps it could do the same for you.
Bro I have no idea what is happening In the name of our Lord and Saviour plase help me
For those not in the know, this game has a booba physics setting. Do as you see fit with it soldier.
MID
What do you mean there's a NSFW patch!?
i love catgirls so much  im not afraid to say it, i am a proud degenerate and will not stop being one. i love nekos. i will be playing this more in the future. 10/10 buy it and buy the 18+ patch for full experience. then buy the other games and play them too  like many people in the reviews, i too have never felt the touch of a woman
This is a game that I have played
cats. girls. 10/10
cat
not good
GREAT MADE ME SMILE YES YES
10/10 worth every cent with the DLC
I played this bullshit for nine goddamn hours waiting for catgirl tiddie payoff, only to find out that all the sexy degenerate hentai smut that was marketed toward my lonely ass was a lie. Turns out the game that steam advertised under the tags "hentai" "nudity" "18+" contained none of these things. I was (understandably) very upset after this blue balling and asked steam for a refund only to get told "sorry loser you wasted more than two hours of you life edging to filler, get fukt". I can understand but ultimately "cannot condone" a kyoto animation type event against Steam headquarters.
this world is a curse there's no small fluffy animal cats to pet
Great game for playing with the whole family.
Nekopara is a visual novel game that features a cast of charming cat-girls that have taken over a bakery. As you progress through the game, you'll discover that the feline ladies are not only incredibly cute but also have distinct personalities and interests.

cute cat girls
Cringe
The first Volume of NEKOPARA, where the journey truly begins! This first game still lacks some proper VN functionality like a backlog jump, but it does appreciated features like displaying Japanese and English text at the same time. Content wise, it lacks a bit behind the later volumes, but that can also be excused by it being the first in the series. As a whole, I recommend the franchise strongly if you enjoy a sweet story and don't mind the harem.
I will never look at my cats the same way, ever again.   ~_~  Thanks Japan.   Overall: 10/10
Neko is good neko is life
cat girls, y not.
Nekopara Vol.1 has captured my heart and imagination like few other visual novels have. From the moment I embarked on this enchanting journey, I was transported to a world of delightful feline wonders that left me utterly mesmerized. This game is nothing short of a masterwork, seamlessly blending captivating storytelling, stunning visuals, and a charming cast of characters that rival the works of literary greats such as Tolkien and Philip K. Dick.  One of the standout features of Nekopara Vol.1 is its meticulously crafted narrative. The game takes you on a whimsical adventure filled with heartwarming moments, genuine emotion, and unexpected depth. The story follows Kashou Minaduki, a talented pastry chef, as he opens a patisserie and discovers that his charming catgirls possess more than just adorable appearances. The game skillfully explores themes of companionship, identity, and the true meaning of family, drawing players into a richly woven tapestry of emotions.  Visually, Nekopara Vol.1 is an absolute feast for the eyes. The character designs are beautifully rendered, each catgirl exuding their unique personality through their expressive eyes, delicate movements, and charming mannerisms. The meticulously detailed backgrounds create an immersive world that feels vibrant and lived-in. The combination of gorgeous artwork and smooth animations brings the characters and their interactions to life, allowing players to truly connect with them on a profound level.  Moreover, the exquisite writing in Nekopara Vol.1 is on par with the likes of legendary authors. The game's creators have masterfully crafted a dialogue that sparkles with wit, warmth, and poignant moments of reflection. The characters' conversations are both endearing and thought-provoking, adding layers of complexity to their already lovable personalities. This exceptional writing elevates the experience, making it a memorable and intellectually stimulating journey that transcends the boundaries of the visual novel genre.  In addition to its narrative prowess, Nekopara Vol.1 also boasts a stellar soundtrack that perfectly complements the storytelling. Each musical composition heightens the emotional impact of every scene, whether it's a tender moment between characters or an exhilarating turning point in the story. The melodies linger long after the game is over, evoking a sense of nostalgia and warmth that further enhances the overall experience.  Nekopara Vol.1 stands as a testament to the creativity, craftsmanship, and passion of its developers. It has the power to captivate players, drawing them into a world brimming with love, laughter, and genuine connections. Like the works of Tolkien, Philip K. Dick, and other esteemed authors, this visual novel transcends its medium, leaving an indelible mark on those who dare to venture into its charming embrace.  Nekopara Vol.1 is a masterstroke that deserves accolades and recognition for its ability to weave a heartwarming and thought-provoking tale, accompanied by breathtaking visuals and an enchanting soundtrack. It is a shining example of the power of storytelling, proving that the visual novel genre can reach the heights of literary greatness.
My father will no longer look me in the eyes.
10/10.

Ngl, I don't hate visual novels and I don't hate slice of life (my main medium in anime/manga actually) but this was just boring as fuck. The best thing about nekopara are the H scenes which are pretty damn hot but they make like 30 minutes in total of it (you also have to buy them separately while other devs include adult patches for free - wtf?)  I feel baited into continuing the series to see more of the lewd scenes but can't bear the thought of going through the SOL part again.   The catgirls are fuken hot tho.
catgirls.
NEKOPARA IS A PRIME EXAMPLE AS TO WHY ANIME CHARACTERS ARE SUPERIOR TO HUMAN FEMALES IN EVERY WAY  Water is wet. But really. And this is not just a physical thing either. But it's as though anime females are BY DESIGN what real females SHOULD aspire to. As a token example, let's say Chocola. That sense of dutifulness. She is naturally helpful and kind to strangers. She cares about her appearance as a courtesy to others around her, but not in a vain way. I know it's silly to ask bio females to try to be EXACTLY like Chocola, it's incredibly lofty, and offensive to the entire construction of who they were at that point. But they are doing it wrong and NEED to know it. It's good to ASPIRE. And I don't know why it's only nerdy libertarian men that aren't offended by this concept. Men aren't offended that jacked dudes exist, and occupy most of the superhero genre. Men are not offended to ASPIRE to something.  But these fucking females. They don't because they've got massive BIG DICK ENERGY-- completely confident that their BLUE hair and SJW livelaughlove dog yoga personalities is what the world should revolve around-- and all the fucking cucks just eat that shit up. That's the whole fucking economy right there. They don't know what's possible because they don't THINK like Chocola. It's because of cucks that don't watch anime, play nekopara and don't set standards that we are in this mess.   Now, Chocola, my dearest Chocola,  As I sit down to write this review, my heart is filled with so much love and adoration for you. You are the sweetest, most charming cat-girl I have ever met, and every moment spent with you is a true delight.From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew there was something special about you. Your bright, cheerful personality and your insatiable love for all things sweet captured my heart from the very start. Your playful antics and mischievous spirit always bring a smile to my face and fill my heart with joy.  But it's not just your adorable nature that I love. It's your unwavering loyalty and your deep capacity for love that truly makes you stand out from the restof the Nekos. You have been by my side through thick and thin, always there to support me and lift me up when I'm feeling down.  Chocola, I want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world. I cherish every moment we spend together and I can't imagine my life without you in it. You are my everything, my sweet little kitty, and I promise to love you and take care of you for all eternity.

This game is amazing, single best game purchase I've ever made. Friends have stopped talking to me because of this game. Highly recommend.
This game fire 10/10. Anyways here is a recipe on a lemon poppyseed cheesecake  1-1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 3 tablespoons butter, melted 4 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 5 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 1/4 cup lemon juice 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 1/3 cup poppy seeds  Preheat oven to 350°. In a small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and butter. Press onto the bottom and 1 in. up the sides of a greased 9-in. springform pan. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, flour and vanilla until smooth. Add eggs, cream, lemon juice, zest and poppy seeds. Beat on low speed just until combined. Pour into prepared crust. Place pan on a baking sheet. Bake until center is almost set, 55-60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight. Remove sides of pan. Refrigerate leftovers.
story is alright but the fact the MC thinks about chocola and vanilla as their daughters after doing what he did to them just.......... no. just no. gonna keep reading just to get to the maple and cinnamon parts. sigh.
I vomit blood
This started my descent into liking catgirls a bit too much  Nekopara helped me attract women in swarms, trust me guys
W game it has catgirls
mmm cat
helped increase my reaction time, now if i hear a footstep i can alt tab faster in a good 4 milliseconds
I have over 1600 hours on this, but steam didn't save them. Great game can't wait for catgirls in real life.
Did you know leaving a review on a hentai games screws over your friends recommendations.
It very cute game, I recommend it
Came for the catgirls,
I mean, it's alright but I could just look up the NSFW scenes on BingVideo. (I'm a major content creator on bingvideo) I also can't run this game smoothly, my high-end IBM Z900 mainframe runs on windows XP and I would love to see the IBM run a bit more for a more authentic experience for us IBM users.
Great Japanese learning material for beginners since you can quickly change languages and access the log. Just remember to touch grass after the study session.
Nekopara is the ultimate neko lover's dream come true! From the adorable catgirls to the heartwarming story, this game is sure to make you say "uwu" with every new scene. As a visual novel, it's one of the best Japanese games ever made, and it's easy to see why.  The art style is simply stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that bring the nekos to life. The voice acting is equally impressive, with each character having a unique voice that perfectly captures their personality. And the music is just as delightful, with catchy tunes that will have you humming along.  But what really sets Nekopara apart is its story. As you follow Kashou and his nekos, you'll be drawn into a world of friendship, love, and pastry-making. It's a heartwarming tale that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside, and it's hard not to get invested in the lives of these lovable characters.  In fact, after playing Nekopara, I found myself daydreaming about becoming a manager in a patisserie just like Kashou. The game's attention to detail when it comes to pastry-making is impressive, and it's hard not to feel inspired to try your hand at baking.
i have been in isolation for months
Vanilla Best Waifu
how can i use segs content
this man makarov is fighting his own war and he has no rules no boundaries he doesn't flinch in torture human trafficking or genocide he's not loyal to a flag or country or any set of ideals he trades blood for money. he's you're new best friend.
this game is amzig
I have never felt the touch of a woman...  Just maybe because of this.

My Dad is allergic to cats so we can't have a cat of our own in our house. But, he never said that we couldn't play games of cats, and thus I got this game, and this game is a certified kawaii classic. Though, I gotta admit, it is hard typing this with one hand.
CATGIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Two horny catgirls seducing you at the same time. What a time to be alive
A lot of replay value
i got this game because i lost a challenge between friendsive never finished it, i'll never finish it, and i will never get the 18+ versionmy wife left me, tails
Very cute game uwuNot an incredible story but tbh no one plays this for the story, you know what I mean
as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.
uwu
too many naked people tbh
good plot
no seggs
ill be honest i bought it at first because "hahah anime catgirls boobs and shit" but the game is honeslty boring it was pretty unbearable for me to sit more than 30 minutes at once, honestly nothing is going on I havent even bothered to learn the overall plot and I wont in the future. save your money
Well I thought it was going to be a cute wholesome game with some fan service because i hadn't looked into it enough I guess so while it WAS cute I was kind of uncomfortable with how weirdly sexual it was. Wasn't expecting this type of game and it's not really up my alley but as long as you know what you're getting into then go for it! (edit: I also have no clue how this game takes up 3.29 GB, it wasn't a problem for me but its quite large compared to other VN I've played)
Incredible game  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRYJGztohD8
I played for 45 hours and just realised i had to buy the dlc.
i was born in the right generation
Nekopara, a kinetic visual novel reputable for its NSFW DLC and memes relating to it, is a game that follows the main character Kashou taking in two major heroines -- Vanilla and Chocolate, both neko-girls -- and starting up a cafe against his father's wishes. The game is the typical rom-com type anime about a family involving numerous neko-girls, which comes with the well-known anime-esqe fanservice (young women with likable personalities).  Nekopara unfortunately does not shatter new ground to the genre and relies heavily on the "kawaii~"-ness of the main neko-girl heroines. The KVN has basic morals to its story such as [i]follow your dreams[/i] and [i]love your family[/i], but it does not feel that said morals were as fleshed out as they could of been. If you are looking for an "emotional" KVN or one that's lighthearted in its storytelling then Nekopara is fine; however, when compared to competition, it really shows its flaws.  In conclusion I would not recommend this game. There are better games out there that would better take up your time.

Came for the catgirls, stayed for the porn.
I regret being born.
I'm not allowed to touch my own cat anymore
i hate this game because i cant play it because i dont have access but there are women and it is scary
Never played the game, but its pinned to my task bar so i launch it by accident every once in awhile. great main menu tho
huh
I'm a simple guy, I like cats and I like girls  Meow meow / 10
This game is a little overrated. The story is too general and not much surprise for me. The part that can not but be mentioned is the H-scene is perfect, compared to the others erogames. This game should be bought with 18+ content.8/10
nice
this game changed my life. i was a poor lonely, and sad husk of a man, but then i saw it.... nekopara! it was beautiful and it changed my life. i now am happy, ripped, i have all of the maidens and i changed my name to chad. i now have great credit score and i have at least 3 million dollars to my named (earned through crypto btw). once one of my maidens brought me a sandwich unasked for, it was a good sandwich. i can honestly say this game is well worth the money for the life changing experience it brought me, overall i give this game 5/5 Mark Ruffalos. Bravo Vince, bravo.
I got it during a sale and I am very happy with my purchase.
It's funny until it gets horny in a creepy way and then never stops. I think Nekopara could be a genuinely good game series if it was not hentai.
There's a, (((10^2+500*log(293)/30.01+3)^0)*100)-32, percent chance that this is my favourite book of all time.
i hate this game. i was forced to play it and scared because my friend is buying me each volume for the next 3 years. help me.
Has endless hours of entertainment and fun. 100% worth it!
When i was a child i got stung by a bee, this would cause me to later have an irrational fear of flying bugs and insects its hard for me to look at ladybugs and flies and i get mild panic attacks at times.  Anyways the game was aight i guess
bro please i've came more than 10 times the horny 10 outta 10 game JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE

Vanilla is the cutest! <3
Tbh, the most wholesome and loving storyline I have ever seen in an anime. 100% recommend if your into Catgirls.
What do you expect?   Catgirls will be catgirls.
This is why should should knock first, mum
abandon hope all ye who enter here.
Oh my catnip, let me tell you about Nekopara, the anime that's guaranteed to make you purr with delight!  Now, if you're not already a fan of catgirls, then Nekopara may not be your cup of milk. But if you are, then get ready for a meow-velous time!  The show follows the story of Kashou Minaduki, a young man who opens a patisserie and hires a bunch of catgirls to work as his assistants. And when I say catgirls, I mean girls with ears and tails who can meow and purr and do all sorts of other cute cat things.  The animation is simply purr-fect, with beautiful backgrounds and character designs that will make your whiskers tingle. And the music is so catchy, you'll be meowing along in no time!  But let's talk about the real stars of the show - the catgirls themselves! There's Chocola and Vanilla, the main catgirls who have a sweet tooth and a love for their master that's almost as strong as their love for catnip. Then there's Azuki and Coconut, the two older sisters who are more serious and responsible, but still know how to have a good time. And let's not forget about the youngest catgirls, Maple and Cinnamon, who are just too cute for words.  The interactions between the catgirls and their master are hilarious and heartwarming, and the show has just the right amount of fan service to keep things spicy without being too... ahem, racy.  Overall, Nekopara is a delightful and charming anime that will leave you feline fine. So if you're a fan of catgirls, sweets, and cute things in general, then this is the purr-fect show for you!

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
its so good!
Yikes
catgirls are the best birthday gift, thank you blaze
Neko
Great VN to relax and read some cutely voiced dialogues. It hasn't any stressful plot or something like that, it's just game to relax. It's amazing choice for catgirl lovers. It also has own anime series, so you can check it out too. Definitely recommend!
Relaxing
this game violates health and safety codes for prepping food and maintaining a clean work environment
zed from LoL fun
This is very fun.
a cat is fine too
I bought this game in a horny daze and i dont remember when i bought it but i do remember when i was broke and yet still bought every other game in the franchise because catgirls are higher on the list then rent and food   10/10 would become broke again for chocola
this game violates health and safety codes for prepping food and maintaining a clean work environment
A tragic dystopia, where a certain kind of mentally-challenged kids is seen as slaves and objects. The main character, a barbaric teenager is using them for his pleasure while trying to grow them as his kids. I almost started crying, this is the saddest game, I´ve ever played.... *Sad Pepe* Almost like Django Unchained and Detroit Become Human had a weeb kid.
lord forgive me for what im about to do
fun if u not into guys
No one is going to see this anyway, so, my ex cheated on me multiple times and I still have yet to recover :)
Cute catgirls story. You can pet and jiggle. 10/10
Amazing one hand gameplay
Cat Girls
I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME!!!
good game i enjoy, 3rd h scene was kinda long tho
Vanilla is real, stop saying she's not. Please.
Meow  Catgirls
Best game i ever played
Great singleplayer game you can play with yourself
this game does not pass the bechdel test at all but i like to pretend it does
Fun short visual novel with cute cat people. Not much depth as always with these cutesy VNs but I like it enough. The [spoiler]sex scene[/spoiler] being there is weird and funny tho.
awooga
not an actual game
There is no explanation needed why i leave positive review on this game.                                          Coconut my beloved.
I'm depressed about women, but I don't mind cat-girls.
👍
Thank god, I finally finished it. Was boring and slow, the entire plot just building up to the h-scenes, with a few points here and there that made me laugh.
"Nekopara Vol. 1" is a visual novel game where players follow the daily lives of catgirls and their human owner. The game is cute and charming with good characters, story, music and voice acting. It's a lighthearted and romantic game but it's short and doesn't have much gameplay.
Nekopara is big funny. Holy shit a game full of catgirls amazing!!!The story is beautiful and full of rich environmental dialouge! the catgirls randomly appear in your shipping box to your new apartment and now you have to take care of them, such a wonderful story! I really wish V1 from the hit game ULTRAKILL magically appeared in the box along with catboy gabriel wearing a cute Nine Inch Nails Broken T-shirt!!!!!!!!!   10/10 game who ever says its bad, i hope a piano falls on you when you walk out your front door >:(

I will never feel the touch of a women, but I have no need for that anymore. For I have nekopara.  Chocola, Vanilla, I will always be with you.
Great game. Beautiful Artwork. Lovely story.
So, how about that chapter 5 huh?
nutable
NEKOPARA has changed my life.  I was weak, stupid, and lacking in self respect, then I saw this game. I can now squat 100 kg, I'm currently working with the world's best genetic engineers to bring catgirls into real life, and still have zero bitches, just like anyone else who owns this wonderful fucking game. If you like bouncy titties, slide right in and enjoy it and the rest of the games when you inevitably fall in love with the cast in a totally anime move as you realize the game is fucking over and you're wondering why the sister is so horny all the time.
If you aren't running a cafe with cat girls then I don't know what you are doing
I regret nothing   [spoiler]coconut and azuki are the best[/spoiler]
Its okay I guess
A friend gifted me this and I just used the skip option to get all the achievements. Not really my cup of tea but if you like visual novels and anime/hentai, I guess this is a game for you. Enjoy
cat girls.
Nekogirls give me life
no life no friends only neko girlfriends

Ah, Nekopara, the so-very-famous Eroge with catgirls and "Overwhelmingly positive" reviews here on Steam and everywhere! Surprisingly the plot goes like this: Kashou runs away from home to open his own cafe and live his dream to become a baker, against his filthy rich family's will. But to his surprise, he is followed by two loyal catgirls of his household, who could not fathom living without him. This series is/was such a success that it spawned 5 games plus one OVA. Is it really all of that?  Let me confuse you for a moment and say "yes, it is". The UI is high quality, way above those cheap RenPy VNs you see around, though it uses the strange low-res (which is typical for japanese Eroge). The art is magnificent. It is richly voice acted. There is quite some character development in the whole series, even though the plot is simply about their daily lives.  The problem here are the heroines. They look, talk and act way too young. Yeah, they are cute, but in an innocent kind of way. This is an Eroge, so, c'mon. Moreover, this is not really a game, but a "kinetic novel". There are 0 choices. It is basically an anime (a hentai, if you have the R18 patch). There is one big feature that might end up being overlooked: you can have the subtitles in English AND Japanese. Quite handy if you're learning Kanji.  Achievements come from simply progressing the game. No Linux port, but worked fine on Proton (thanks Valve!). The cards from this game were once one of the most expensive on Steam but they have since chilled a bit and became more affordable.  Even though I am a raging nekophile [spoiler]someone who loves catgirls[/spoiler] I'm not recommending this one. Get this only if you're an absolute pervert. Which you might be. I'm not judging.
Cats are really cool animals
I like cat girls a little too much
worth the price for a 9.99 dollars game. works better with the DLC which is a must have. of course that will be 20 bucks and thats not worth the price, but it is too classic and it is a must play game if you say you like cat girls.
pick up gun. shoot head. peace at last.
I swear a friend of mine gifted me this game.
Even after 8 years this game is still a blast to play!  Someone tell Elon to fund r&d and make genetically engineered cat girls a reality :3
The cats are cute
Pedophile simulator game.
v good
As a VN fan, this is a pass, as it is pretty mid. If you like lewding catgirls, then this game is more up your alley. But there are better kinetic novels, better cheerful comedy VNs, and better 18+ novels if any of those are your thing:  Pros: - The art is very charming, and animations are good - Voice acting is well done - Some chapters are fairly decent, story-wise (2, 3, and 8) - Options to play in two languages at once! I love it when games let you do this  Cons: - Writing is pretty bad, most of which being repetitive padding to set up the next little comedy or erotic bit - Most of the story is pretty poorly done, with two chapters literally being copy-pastes of each other (one focused on Chocola and one focused on Vanilla) - There is some world-building and character-building that just... gets dropped? Maybe they are saving it for the later volumes - Music is fun, but way too repetitive - The 18+ content, if you choose to go that route, wasn't really worth it. It just plays out what's inferred in the game, and two of the scenes are, once again, almost copy-paste of each other  - ...... okay, I'll say it. Catgirls are mid-to-bottom tier on the nekomimi scale imo, and this game is no exception. The only exceptions to this rule are Stella Hoshi from VA-11 HALL-A and Ichigo from Tokyo Mew Mew (Edit: I forgor about Neco-Arc... please don't cancel me!)
cute catgirls
i hate myself
This has to be one of my favorite games of all time, when i get bored I always seem to come back to it and it has had a chokehold on me since i started playing.  I am truly addicted to nekopara and i can't stop playing it and I will continue playing it until my fingers fall off and I cannot click anymore.  The gameplay makes me feel something, it's like a light in this darkness we call reality, it's an escape from all the troubles I have to go through on a daily basis.  The gameplay is so cute and when i see the silly little cat girls on my screen i can't help but get my legs kicking and hit a state of euphoria from the dialogue.  it's almost like i'm conversing with a real life cat girl.  This game is ahead of its time and there won't be anything like it anytime soon. I say pick this game up if you want to play through a masterpiece of a title and you definitely won't regret it.  It all started when Chocola first came on my screen followed by Vanilla and it was love at first sight.  I've never in my life looked at my computer screen and felt so immersed like I was actually there on screen.  It was truly an amazing sensual experience.
I haven't played too many visual novel type games before this but I felt like this was a quality one with good animations, physics, music, art, and videos that were utilized in a wonderful fashion. I specifically enjoyed different characters and scenes being introduced over time. I did notice that there are cut animations on the steam version that led to a few sudden jumps, the opening and ending videos failed to play, and there were a few minor graphical glitches which are going to knock it down a bit. I also wished there was more involvement with choices, even if my choices didn't impact anything, just so I can feel like I am more part of the story. Overall this was a pretty good experience that I would recommend for the price.  7/10
Fun for the whole family
Didn't know what to expect but I should have expected that
Cat girls
I'm scared for I have sinned. Again, cat doesn't wear clothes, so it's normal.
I was getting steam cards, I'm not actually this kind of weeaboo. I'm sure the game is good though, someone had to make the art.... they're the real weirdos I think no? Selling their souls for this  just to make money. Capitalism at work folks.
Ok look, doing it on the kitchen table isn't the most hygienic thing, but it definitely spices things up a bit.
Tbh... kinda mid
this is literally just final fantasy 14
This was the best game out of all the games i have ever played. The character building in this game is simply the best its amazing to see how Vanilla and Chocola develop in the story and grow into their own individual amazing (and sexy) characters. This is amazing and has truly changed my outlook on life itself. Artistic yet simple. Inovative and genius. Creative but truly fun. This deserves an award worth bilions of dollars. Human history has been leading up to this game not only is this the greatest piece of art but the greatest invention ever truly amazing. I hope everyone in the world gets a chance to see this. It truly connects people everyone can enjoy this masterpiece. Actually masterpiece is not a good enough word for this creation of genius.
.
I wait until I bought the uncensored patch, which I cannot buy because germany...I hate it here sometimes... T^T
Wow catgirls. I like. Very naice. 10/10 toebeans.
i wish i was a cat
Mom I swear, they [b] love [/b] me!!!!!!!!
cat lolis and milfs
i feel dishonor
buy really good
Nekopara is a great
I don't understand why is it Overwhelmingly Positive. Manage somehow 6 chapters. it's just boring.
"A cat is fine too..."  I want to immediatly state that i don't necesarily think NekoPara is bad or that i wouldn't recommend it to anybody, far from it. I definitely think NekoPara does everything it wants to do and does it well. Sadly it just didn't click with me at all and this review is a summary with some points as to why.  NekoPara always seemed like one of the big classic Visual Novels on Steam. Mainly because it released at a time when the Storefront didn't read like the titles of DVDs you would find in  Video rentals in a Red Light District and Visual Novels (especially H-Visual Novels) were rather scarce, so my curiousity was certainly piqued a little going into this after all these years. What i got was an expected Harem-Romance Visual Novel with hilariously high Production for a really forgettable, rather tame Love Story between a very bland, generic MC and two biologically engineered Girl-Cat Hybrids.  The art is good, the music is cheery (although a little limited) and almost the entire cast got full Voice Acting. The Portraits have a suprising amount of Animation going on and feel very lively and expressive, it was quite the pleasant suprise.  As for that cast, Chocola and Vanilla at times can come of as a little intrusive and annoying unfortunately. Chocola more so as she never seems to dial it back. Repetition happens a LOT in the entire VN and i never felt so inclined to flatout skip dialogue in a Visual Novel before. The other catgirls barely have a presence in Vol. 1. Shigure, the little sister with the hots for her big Brother the MC, gave me the creeps.  I can deal with the silly world of Catgirls existing and essentially being second class citizens but if your leads can't carry the story it ultimately becomes very monotone and boring. It overall just felt like a dime a dozen Anime Plot you have seen, read and heard lots of times before.  Also since this is technically an 18+ Game, let's briefly talk about that. Cheesy sound effects, the two girls yelling the same lines for twenty to thirty minutes repeatedly and the heavy pixelation did nothing for me in the slightest. Either i am into way more frisky and kinkier stuff or i am too old to get excited about (no pun intended) Vanilla Intercourse. Regardless i think an Asking Price of around 8 Bucks for these 18+ Patches is way too high.  To wrap up, NekoPara may be a Paradise for Catgirl Lovers, many others, especially those who want more, should probably pass on this one.

Not enough cute cat boys.
A legend of a game, there is no match for it with the same themes would recommend for anyone who have abandoned the right path in life.
Father I swear this is the last time I touch the cat.
Neko paradise!! Actually wholesome story to be honest.  Aside from that, it's just a visual novel with no choice whatsoever.
this game sucks you cant kill people
Worth it. High quality game, art and story
got to chapter 5, refunded
its ok
I bet you $20 my name is true.  and then I'll be out of $20.

Not much game play, easy and one handed for a reason... Enter at your own risk... ALWAYS turn up the special slider in settings ;)

Incredible
high quality stuff
catgirls bright up my days
Neko = love
Me and my family love playing this game! 10/10 for story, 10/10 for graphics!
UwU. Buy this hentai.... I mean game
this is the worst game i have ever played, bar none. never before have i felt such excruciating torment as i did while playing through this experience. each second i spent in this nightmare realm of catgirls exponentially increased my desire to throw my entire computer away and fling myself directly into the sun. upon making it to the 5th, 6th, and 7th acts of this hellish disaster of a game, after observing the "content" this game has to offer, i felt a severe urge to claw my eyeballs out which was only compounded by each consequent scene. upon playing this game, i experienced emotions i could have never imagined prior; extreme discomfort, physical and mental torment, and severe depression are nothing compared to what i felt when opening this game and experiencing it for the first time. i would rather shove myself head-first into a meat grinder than go through the pure, concentrated hell that this game is. please, for the love of all that is holy, do not subject yourself to this torment as i did. do not purchase this game, even if it and the dlc are each on sale for $4, making it an objective steal in marketing terms. this is the worst $8 i have, and ever will, spend on anything in my entire life without a doubt. it's not worth it. i beg you to consider doing literally anything else with your time, as even sitting in your chair contemplating the universe for a trillion years would be miles more productive than playing this game. the mere six hours i spent playing this do not accurately represent the torture and torment i endured, as a lifetime of struggle in the deepest reaches of hell would be the only thing that could possibly rival this. don't subject yourself to the "cute" catgirls. they are a ploy. it's all an elaborate setup to get you to fall for it, only to lure you into its devastating trap and devour you from the inside. don't subject yourself to the horrific writing, consisting of 10 minute long scenes talking about age and shampoo and fucking whale sharks. play something meaningful that can change your life for the better, or at the very least, play something that is harmless. this game is the pure embodiment of the devil himself. hell is a welcome treat in comparison to this; so take a vacation there, and enjoy your time, knowing full well that you have escaped an obscene fate. i envy you.
cat girls <3
this game is the start of my love for cat girls...
good game
I never played this game. I don't know why it's even on my computer. It must have been my friend Clara.
努力发掘DLC
You wanna fuck with me? Okay.  You wanna play rough? Okay.  Say hello to my little friend!
I have crippling depression now and I love it!
wait why do i have this game??
great game with Nekos, which makes you like them
nekomimi is the way
this shit is a minor inconvenience
Yeah that worked for me
Received more love from Vanilla and Chocola than from my family and friends. 10/10
Story is great if you like eroge. I don't recommend it if you're not into moe culture though. Art is fantastic if you're a weeb ass like me.   Do not play without the 18+ DLC, it is legit crucial to the story. If you pick up this game anywhere else it'll be $20, and it comes with the DLC. Steam is the only place you can experience this story without it, and it doesn't feel right. A lot of plot discrepancies for all the games if you leave out the h-content.
after playing this game, my cat mittens has been looking at me with lustful eyes, save me
Bought this game as a joke...ended up playing it sadly
i wasnt expecting to to be geniuenly emotional and sentimental, but it was?! the lewd scenes we're so geniune and earned ??? the jokes are suprisingly really funny and all the characters have charm. plus the art is adorable! i find shigure and mc's relationship rlly weird though... skipped through almost all of their dialogue..   anyways, if u only care ab the lewd aspects of the game i dont think you'd like it all that much, theres no like sex scenes unless u bought the dlc ( i think? ) and its just before and after its happend .. so it's mostly just story... anyways if u just like cute cat girls and wholesome stories i think you'd like this if you're willing to bear with the lewd
Nekopara Vol. 1 is A Very Good Game. Why you ask?:  Good Things:  ✔ I Mean, It's A Great Novel~ ✔ Dialogues Were Really Well Made~ ✔ I Like That You Can Backtrack Your Steps Of Reading~ ✔ Kinda Laughed At The "P" Button Thing~ [spoiler](Boobs Bounce)[/spoiler] ✔ About The +18 DLC, [spoiler](Why Would You Make Them Dirty?)[/spoiler] But, It's Fine~  Bad Things:  ✖ How Adorable These Girl's Are, [spoiler](Can Easily Get Taken Advantage Of)[/spoiler] (No Joke) ✖ Wanting To Be Treated Like A Human, I Understand That.. But, F***ing?! (No!) ✖ People Can Really Put There Life & Soul Into Some Fake Catgirls? (It's Sad) ✖ I Don't Like When People Think About F***ing These Cute Catgirls! (Need Help People!) ✖ If Anyone Of You Think I'm Like You On The Sex Thing With These Catgirls.. (F*** Off)  • P.S. - I Love The Whole Idea Of The Game Being Made With Compassion & Understanding Of What These Catgirls Want. I Hope The Dev's Create More Of These Adorable Novels! <3
its a great and wholesome experience but why did you have to cut the sexy stuff out steam, WHY GIVE ME THE NEKO BOOBAS I DESERVE!!!!!!!!!!
kitties
Awesome story and character design.
Worldbuilding's kinda screwed (catgirls who are looked upon as slaves) but it's pretty interesting to see how normal people treat these catgirls when they aren't around their master. There's some comedy, bit of romance, but it's mostly slice of life with a lot of fully animated H scenes. It's a linear visual novel, so no choices. That's about it. What you see is what you get.
The plot of this game is really stupid but I was promised it would help me get better at csgo.  edit: I am DMG now and it's all thanks to cat girls.
pretty good, liked the... ah story. *wink wink nudge nudge.
I mean. sex?
yes
Neko
Better than RDR 2.
Блять, что я вообще прошёл, ну а так, норм впринципе, советую

cool
For the "Labor of Love" award nomination
Cats
NSFW, YES!
Yes...
Only God can judge me.
I promise, I bought this to practice my Japanese
I enjoy videogame very good i pray that Allah doesnt see my sins
I've played this game with some friends, getting all anchievements and cards while on DIscord.  It has some good art, but I believe it just isn't my style of game. A friend gifted me this gave and I have to say, I'm glad I didn't spend ‎$9.99 in this. Now I have another 100% game on Steam and that's all. It's not for me. But if you enjoy catgirls, sure, go ahead.
You need to buy the sex scenes separately.
Catgirls. Do I need to say anything more?
I wake up, I think of Vanilla I brush my teeth, I think of Vanilla I eat breakfast, I think of Vanilla I drive to class, I think of Vanilla I listen to lectures, I think of Vanilla I go get lunch, I think of Vanilla I take exams, I think of Vanilla I go home, I think of Vanilla I go to work, I think of Vanilla I eat dinner, I think of Vanilla I go to sleep, I think of Vanilla Vanilla Syndrome Intead of brain, there is Vanilla
its not for me i guess

for those who came for the H staff don't bother. even the R18 patch from dlsite doesn't work. what a ripoff.  steam should have pointed out they cut all the H scenes. this is a straight scam
✔️ Tested on Steam Deck, working fine (11/11/2022). You'll need to touchscreen to browse the menu and 'A' button works for advancing text.  catgirls

good
Absolutely Masterful. One of the greatest literary works of this century.
my dog installed and 100% this game i dont even know what it is, what is this game ive never played it
Standing here I realize You are just like me Trying to make history But who's to judge The right from wrong When our guard is down I think we'll both agree That violence breeds violence But in the end it has to be this way I've carved my own path You followed your wrath But maybe we're both the same The world has turned And so many have burned But nobody is to blame Yet staring across this barren wasted land I feel new life will be born Beneath the blood stained sand Beneath the blood stained sand
Truly the most game of all time
miauw
Amazing family friendly fun
Neko Girl Cute Cute Yes Yes, This Is A Review
1
Its pretty alright
ahhhh my penis, cum sex
Vol 0 and extra was cute and wholesome. Vol 1 is too, it just has 18+ scenes on top of it. Without the 18+ dlc those scenes are heavily suggested and characters talk about it after the fact. While with the dlc those scenes are shown.  Would I reccomend it for the plot? No.  It's just a harem with slice of life elements.   Yet It's somehow relaxing to play, as there's nothing deep about it.
The most life-changing experience I have had in my entire life, this game truly is the epitome of video game making and art.

omaygot kitty
My wife may have left me, but none of that matters anymore! Gone are my days of insatiable sadness exemplified by gallons upon gallons of tears sobbed as a result of my traumatic existence, as I have found a new happiness in the form of catgirl maids! Now I spend my days doing everything I could ever want with these unfathomably wonderful 2D women, free from the responsibilities of a real relationship, able to do as I please! The rope I bought from Lowes may no longer have a purpose, but hey! Life is now great again. Thank you, Nekopara!
I LOVE CREAMING CATGIRLS
i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. ive never done anything weird with my cats.
naughty.
I cant read
Cute cat girls doing cute things. Hell yeah.
This game is so fire!
The game is good however the steam version is censored and has the objectively most important scenes removed entirely. You can install a patch to get those back though!
I got this for free but it made me buy VOL 2
these cats crazy ah hell bwoa aha ^_^
I'd play during school hours in the front of class
cat.
Don't worry guys, they're 9 months old.
Its pretty good
I've seen a lot of degeneracy in my years. This shit is an all-time low... The plot is pathetic, the writing makes me cringe and the main girls are under a year old. You gotta be one sleazy mf if you're someone this appeals to.

cat
HELP!!! How do i remove my hours in this game??? I got hacked
Best game ever!!
i love catgirls!!!!
the beginning of a legendary franchise
good
Sure part 2 electric boogaloo
This story was too formative an experience for me to be able to rationally criticize it. Chocola and Vanilla are two of the cutest creatures ever, and... I don't feel the need to say anything more.
good
nya
The game get me into the whole franchise, which is obvious full of super cute and moe cat girl in maid costume. Also made me have no feeling with real girl lol.
it's nice
Playing this is like watching Boko No Pico.  If you're a normal person, with a normal social life, who goes outside and touches grass.  This will be torture on a level you have yet to experience. Almost on the level of watching Boko No Pico. That being said, It's a great game to make you lose faith in humanity. That's because, while you're cringing, you'll be thinking about the fact that people play this unironically.  For what it's worth, i've never played a visual novel before and never will again. But cringeness beside, it's not bad.  10/10.
Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication.
This is one of the scariest games I've ever played
10/10 Life change
depending on how you look at it this is either the best or the worst birthday present ever
It'd be better with minecraft sex scenes. Also when Doom Guy shows up and kills Milk, I got sad, great game though, maybe needed some more racial slurs (cos catgirls) and genocide.
a true classic psychological horror experience. Not for the faint of heart.
naked cat girls 10/10

UWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGH CAT GIRL FUCKING AHGAHGAGHDFGJH
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
cat girl make brain go brrrr

I didn't really get to play this, since the 18+ DLC is for some reason unavailable in Germany, and I don't see the point of playing a smut game with no smut. Also, why Germany? It's a country where nudist beaches are almost a national pastime and nudity is so normalised, you get sexy shows on public TV. Oh well.
Cat is amazing
I do not recommend this game
For a starter I cannot describe how much this game cured my crippling depression, the Nekopara Franchise has honestly cured my depression and helped me with suicidal thoughts. My depression was really bad last month as I had finished high school and becoming a shut in neat, my family kicked me out because I had become too "weird" because of my usual hobbies, I tried to explain that the anime body pillow was the only friend I need but they wouldn't listen. After finding somewhere to move in, my room partner recommended that I try the Nekopara franchise, at first I shrugged it off but after awhile my depression got really bad and it was my friends last wish for me to try the game. The opening of the game filled me with joy as I saw 2 cat girl waifus appear on the screen that was pure eye candy. I dropped everything in my life and started sweating on this game and my depression and misery started to finally fade away after 4 years of torture. The visuals in the game are nothing special but that's one of its charms, the art of the cat girls in this game are 100% waifu content and the art style making me feel good inside. The feelings I get when I play are so mixed that it makes me feel alive again, from laughter to tears, the game makes you feel alive and that you are really there. As people say its not about the graphics that make a game good its about the story and the plot, the Nekopara series of games are far by the best story games of all time and the visuals 100% carry the story, The story follows you as Kashou Minaduki "Master" and your two cat girls Chocola And Vanilla, it makes you wish you were the MC (not Minecraft) and makes you dream you had 2 perfect cat girls at your side.   The best feature of the game is its adjustable jiggle physics, it made the immersion 100 times better and I would consider that feature one of the main reasons my depression is gone today, half way through the story my depression was almost gone and I could be found sitting in my room for hours at a time enjoying this game. The anime waifus in the game make me so happy and really feel like I am loved and at ease. when I put the game on, it brings a smile to my face and really feels me with joy. When I have bad thoughts of my abusive household I always hop on Nekopara and it makes me feel happy again. Sometimes I find my self playing this game and staring at the "holy scenes" for way to long and I'm happy to say this game has great "holy scenes" the R18+ Patch is defiantly a must buy with the game looking 9999 times better, the patch makes the game actually have character and makes the "epic scenes" 9999 times better to watch.   When I play this game I whole heartily play for the plot, don't get me wrong most people play for the "swaggy scenes" but for me I 100% play the plot, the best thing in my opinion has to be its funny use of comedy and how its attached to 2 innocent cat girls that just want "Master" to be happy. I know people way criticise me for being a odd one out for playing for the plot but its TRUE! I genuinely play for this games plot.  Now I know many people are going to be reading this review so I'm going to describe the best way of playing this game without anyone else knowing, you need to obviously need to own the game (DUH) and own a high tech trip wire laser that pulls up your pants and closes the game when activated, you should have these materials laying around but one thing that you might need to get is a good wireless mouse so you can click to advance the plot when your a "little" far from your computer, after these materials it should be self explanatory.  I know I might sound like I'm repeating my self but the game is just one of or maybe the #1 story game out there, not many other games can cure someone's depression that has been going on for many years and not many other games can bring a smile to sad mans face but I can 100% confirm this game will just do that but triple your expectations. To be honest if your reading this far into the review I think you have done yourself a favour and should be the type of person to pick up this game.  If your still reading this I think you want to know a little bit more about my mental health before playing Nekopara, to be honest I have really been suffering and when I go outside I feel like I'm being stared at all times and it doesn't help with my anxiety, When I was inside after being outside all day I feel like I cant breathe and when I got to bed my sleep paralysis demon haunts me everyday, but everything changed when I moved out and became more independent, at first when I moved out I was on the "verge" and wanted to die everyday because it got way worse but one day I got recommended a strange game called Nekopara, to be honest I wasn't having it and had zero interest playing that silly game at all but my friend wished i played it one time so i finally gave in and gave it a shot.  As a final note, I know its not just me who has used this game as a way of escaping and curing my depression, The Game is healing for me, therapeutic for sure. I hear this for lots of others too and I think it’s an absolutely beautiful phenomenon. I’ve never been one to keep up on hobbies and see them through. I always give up when I see I'm just wasting my time. I always feel too lazy to get up and do something or my depression takes over. This is not the same. I’m yearning all the time to get back in the game and fix the thing I messed up last session. I’m always wanting to see if I am just good enough to have those 2 as my waifus. I just wanted to say that I am so grateful for this game and I hope it brings you the peace and joy it brings me even as just a starter. I honestly think that this game is the BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!  3/10 (sound track too expensive)
Yeah, it is a good game.
After running through this game 3 times, I actually saw the beauty of Nekopara. We were all here for one reason, and one reason only. Cute cat girls in maid outfit. Yeah yeah... we got that but now that I understood the story, I came to a sudden conclusion that this game is one of the best out there. Not only does this portray a story that most individuals will never EVER experience, this gives us, desperate weebs, a chance to experience love for the first time. Love from many individuals in both affection and sexual. This changes the game. I really see why Nekopara is such a loved game. It's honestly amazing how this game can lure us in by fanservice, and make us stay for the story. The wholesome story of 2 cat girls sharing a master, also wanting to do the funny with him. Props to the creator, however there is 1 issue. I dont want to pay extra for seggs scenes. Please include them in the purchase, thanks.
mediocre at best
Before I go any further, I want to clarify this. I did not play this game, it was my girlfriend, I swear.
meow
Ok sexy but why do all the Bugs with the Big booties say Ok and then kill all the cats like 3 in a row like a jigsaw and then say

"The end, beginning, and the present have all rejoiced in tears at what humanity has created, as beings with the capabilities of both discovering the world's great mysteries, but also bring chaos to their perception, have rained down on the timeline" -My final words before jumping off my queen's web  I hail to the spiderqueen, as I am part of her 11,000 little broodie babies. While frolicking around the fields of her majesty's silk, I happened to come across [NEKOPARA VOLUME 1] wedged between two thick white ropes. I decided I would give it a read. Chapters went by. and by. by. I webbed into a state of deep spider despair knowing that me and my 10,999 other broodie baby spider would never scribe such literature. How beautiful these pages are as they flow across my chitn appendages. How wonderful people the writers must be, knowing they have done pull ups on humanity's highest bar. Wordplay such as "big fatty tuna" and "Catpanion" would never grace the scape of a spider's mind. But, ohohoho, how the other broodies hated me for this genius. They shot meters of silk into my face saying "This is completely fucking degenerate" Dare they say that again. Now Im here, at the edge of spiderworld (which is flat) ready to fall to spider doom. Here I go. Weeeeeeeeeeeee. Thank you [NEKOPARA VOLUME 1]
neko love.
The story was cute until the cats got horny, oops.
There is a reason for Nekopara be such a recognizable game. As a visual novel every technical aspect of it is either good or excellent. Art, music, character design, bgm. All have very good quality and are extremely memorable. The dialogues, with the exception of the protagonist, are fully voice acted. On a side note this is the only vn I know that has voice, a japanese and and an english subtitle making Nekopara unironically one of the best ways to learn japanese. The story maybe the most generic aspect of the game, but even then it can still appeal to the wholesome slice of life crowd. [b]Overall would become a complete disappointment for my parents again![/b]
love this
bouncy  bgm is great, would buy for a friend
bruh its raining look
sex
I payed money to press the space bar over and over again. THIS is peak gaming.
the mc just drink acid and think every cat he met is a hot girl then fuck every cat he met 10/10 best game
Nekopara 👍
For me, the first half of the game was very boring. But after that was like gorgeous art. Easily playing with one hand.

sim sim q belo jogo
.
sex is expensive
NEKOS ARE THE BEST
Very nice game
yeah.
what
This game has everything you could ever want. Catgirls. Slavery. Child slavery. Catgirl child slavery.
I didn't think there'd be SO MUCH TEXT! They could've added more pictures to make the story easier to go along with. Hopefully the other games don't take as long
I'm gonna pre, dude
I like cats
I learned about steam invisibility with this game.  Played on: Ubuntu 20.04 NVIDIA GTX 1050 ti
god i hate my life
warning: game has French "people" do not play
Its perfect
i want to kill every single one of these characters
I have a relative that used to be depressed all of the time. Nothing could cheer him up and his drug addiction only worsened through time, he got to the point of spending all of his money on drugs, he then had to sell his house and was left with nothing. But I had a solution, I invited him to my house and casually presented nekopara to him, that flipped his life, he overcame his drug addiction and is now an astonishing businessman.  10/10 I still need to play more before giving my final conclusions.
Yep, just, y e p
I love ruining my friend's recommended store page
Lovely game.
"I didn't fuck my cat. I didn't cum on my cat. I didn't put my dick anywhere near my cat. I've never done anything weird with my cats." -Shane Dawson
1/10 for making me a lesbian
Do you really want to be here?
Being a man who has a lot of sex at all times, I can say that this game is 100% similar to having sex with a woman, as I always do. Obviously this game did not make me horny. I'm not gay, I have plenty of sex with real women to spend 15 minutes with. On the other hand, I would like to recommend this game to people who don't have sex (not like me, because I have a lot of sex with women, a lot) as if there is a naked woman there and she is naked. One character looks like one of my several girlfriends with whom I had a lot of sex. I've had a lot of sex. I'm also very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I'm very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say I am very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my crushes asked me to have sex with her, but I told her I was playing a sex game and she started crying and became a lesbian and committed suicide because I didn't have sex with her. I have sex with women, not men, I am not gay. I am very cool and handsome, so girls always want to have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. My penis is very big. All my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and I am very good at sex and I am. I have a lot of sex. I am also handsome and sexy and I have sex.
Only worth it to play with the uncensored pack , otherwise how would you bust a nut to this game amirit guys ;>
[h2]NekoPara[/h2] [i]It's a Neko Paradise![/i]  [h3]Preclaimer[/h3] - This is an Adult Visual Novel, designed to be R18, which is why I consider the R18 content part of the whole and will include it in this review. If for whatever reason you are not interested in this content or aren't legally allowed to play it, you should just skip this review. - Since many visual novels are similar in a bunch of ways, I'm gonna review this one on a few common aspects, including reference to other VNs aswell as giving independent explanations. - If you want a [b]full[/b] series review with glorious detail, beautiful images and more you may want to take a look [url=https://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/post/nyan-nyan-nekoparaiten]>> here <<[/url].  [hr] [h3]Graphical & Technical Quality[/h3] The NekoPara Franchise is a well know milestone in the world of Visual Novels. Featuring an amazing artstyle that can also be seen in "The Ditzy Demons are in Love with Me", full fledged Emote Engine Live2D throughout the entire game (aka. fully animated characters), a nice soundtrack and a solid Engine foundation with a modified KiriKiri Engine version.  This gives us common features like up to 80 individual save slots whose description you can individually change, quick saving and loading, auto and skip mode with adjustable behaviour, basic customization options (which can be further changed through the hidden advanced settings) and an overall smooth performance.  NekoPara even throws it's own share of gimmicks into the mix, for example a slider setting to modify the physical behavior of a certain body area *hint hint*.  On the downside though, NekoPara is a 720p VN resulting in noteable quality loss on normal 1080p monitors in fullscreen and beyond. Also, being the oldest part of the series, it has some minor hicups like broken idle lip sync when skipping a dialogue with a running animation too fast.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652564[/url]  [hr] [h3]Content & Runtime[/h3] What can you expect from NekoPara? Of course not spoiling the actual story, it is an overly cute, very lighthearted romance story with the usual amount of comedy mixed in, making it a nice game to enjoy whenever you feel the need for cute Nekos doing cute things to brighten up your mood. Except for the generic "wake up" moment of sudden emotion there isn't any real story to it, other than Slice of Life from the view of our male protagonist.  Even though, the characters have distinct personalities making them unique and offering a wide variety of archetypes you might enjoy. The male protagonist is absolute average, going with the carefree theme of the story. And while Volume 1 focusses around the first two of them, NekoPara as a whole features 6 heroines (and the wannabe heroine sister) in a perfectly peaceful harem situation.  Which brings us to the most important point: NekoPara is a completely linear novel with absolutely no choices whatsover. That means if you don't like the harem setting you have no way to get around it, and that also means the average playtime (not rush skipping) is around only 10h.  The gallery is available from the very beginning, allowing you to enjoy the 22 CGs, 7 SD artworks, 15 OSTs and all "Scenes" and movies again - as long as you already saw them ingame that is.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652621[/url]  [hr] [h3]The R18 content[/h3] Even though the R18 DLC costs almost as much as the base game, it's worth it not only for the sake of having the full game.  Even in the H department NekoPara is going all out with animated (GIF loop-ish) H-scenes, 3 of them in total, and accompanying sound effects (if you like them or not is up to you, you can mute them). You also, as usual, get a few "uncensored" CGs that otherwise would have been less nude.  Though funnily someone wanted to be extra, extra careful about sharing the R18 content - even though it's still [b]mosaic censored[/b] and hence legal even in Japan - because the game itself surpresses it by auto blurring Steam screenshots from R18 scenes, switching the game to All Ages when Steam streaming and forcefully exits when trying to stream while in a said R18 scene. Though most people won't be bothered by any of that anyway.  When it comes to the depictions of bodily fluids, the inhuman stamina of the actors or even the whole act in total - let's just say it's "as unreal as a perfect catgirl harem paradise", so expect [i]a lot[/i]. Other than the absolute basic hentai amounts of SM tendencies though it's pretty vanilla.  [hr] [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1860652581[/url]  [hr] [h3]Conclusion[/h3] Is this game worth it? While I do agree that NekoPara is mighty expensive, being only slightly cheaper than the average 60h multi route VN while only featuring 10h of linear story, it's still a very good VN. If you don't have something awesome of said multi route caliber in your to buy list or just have a severe craving for cute catgirls, buying the bundle in the next sale is your best bet. Unless you are too impatient, then buying it right now is an option too. As an "I'm still unsure" alternative, there is an anime level OVA version of Vol.1 (even here on Steam) which you could look into.    [code]Helpful review?

Good plot and story, too much sex
Me: I will always try to 100% any game that I start! My friend: ok :)  (10/10 game would recommend)
Cute buba
did you know that if you recommend games it pops up in your friend's store pages and you can ruin their suggestions?
orginal is always better then it's cheap copy (Stray)
When other reviews say "i put just a couple of hours in the game and i can say that its good" they are not lying. Like [u]WOW[/u]
brain rot
Don't worry guys, they're 9 months old
Really fun, cute, Visual Novel ^w^  I got the 18+ patch for the game but the 'naughty bits' are censored with a mosaic. Regardless, I still really love and enjoy this game. It's adorable and relaxing. I really recommend it to any anime, neko girl lover out there. And anyone who just really likes cute things. Don't play it around family or friends though!
I have to admit, the first time I came across Nekopara, I had NO interest. After seeing it pop up again a few times while looking for other visual novels, I noticed that it had a high rating so I figured I'd give it a try. I fell in love with this game and series! It's cute, funny, and can sometimes really hit the feels. I would HIGHLY recommend this game!
only problem is the chinese achievement, ive opened the game a few times and set it to chinese but it wont give me it
This is not a game - It's just a story-infused clicker.  I was bored just staring at my screen, clicking away.  By the time the H-scenes came along, I honestly didn't care.  The fact that the Adult DLC is still censored makes it a utterly pointless additional purchase.  The cat girls are pretty, but I could easily reproduce my experience by downloading pics off the internet and then scrolling through them with music playing in the background.  Definitely not for me.
i think my friends hate me now
Cat girl make dopamine go funny ha ha
Good
" I liked the anime lets see the game, Why is the a 18+ versions, why is he fing the girls" some random person  "my nuts are empty how do i refile"

This game made me cry literal tears of joy. Buy it, worth every cent.
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I came for the plot.
I can feel it, trembeling inside of this body as my fragile skin starts to be torn like wool cloth. I loose control of my fingers 21 time a day and my hands are unable to hold even a feather to write with. My vision obscured by something wich resides not on top, but inside of, my eye, i see no more blues or greens or yellows or even purples, only reds, the colour of blood its the only colour it wants me to see so it pains me with blindness the times i resist it, about 21 minutes does the times of my blured vision last until it clears away and i return to my world of red and brown and black and white and mostly drab grey. The bones of my Skelletum move against my will at many times and dislocate or even break appart like brittle sticks when i attempt resistance from it. It swarms inside. Its voice comments on my behaviour, whispers its cruel orders with malicious intent or keeps quiet, but i know it looks throgh my eyes. The black spot in the upper part of the sclera of my right eye keeps growing, each morning i look into the mirror for 21 minutes and i see it, sitting there like it belongs, giving the rest of the eye a red tint from how much i rub it hoping it goes away by daybreak. I have told the doctor that the eyedrops wich i have been comanded to take are not effective and i can barely keep the eyelids apart from each other, it has been just like this for the las 21 days, but as he ignores my rant he keeps on telling me that i must not resist against the power of good, Theseus has sunk. Psychiatrist, psychotherapy, medication are words i have been made to remember every once in a week for 21 weeks, the woman in a stark white lab coat and a illfitted dress listens to me rant for 21 minutes at a time each moonday before interupting my speech and asking me the single quistion she asks everey moonday of every week, is your mother sleeping well?, a question i respond with a singuilar and decisive yes every moonday of every week, still unsure of what she means though, i tell, i tell all, i feel it inside of this vessel feeding and drinking from my thout itself, it grows inside and i slowly become it and it slowly become me until i do not resemble my own self anymore, i feel how i become something else apart from who and what i am now. Growing.Feeding.Breeding.Multiplying.Melting.Becoming(whole).Growing.Growing.Growing.

Nekopara, the series that combines sexy and cute really well, 10/10
This game literally changed my life. Ever since this game came out all I can do is play Monopoly for the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. Originally I purchased this game to play with my friends but after forcing them to play about five games in a row they all decided that they have had enough for the day. My intense desire for Monopoly wasn't satisfied so I moved on to playing against a full room of AI. After my tenth game against five hard AI I was still not satisfied but my urge had to wait as I passed out before I can start a new game. When I wake up I see my switch is at low battery so I plug it in and go straight to playing Monopoly. I played one round with five hard AI but my urge simply got worse, I figured that I wasn't getting my fill since it was so long between my turns. I decided to change it to one hard AI but after about 3 games I started to get impatient with the AI to the point that I was screaming at the top of my lungs telling this AI to hurry his turn up so that I can play. It was around this time that my mother came into my room telling me that I woke her up and that she was taking my Switch away so that she can get some sleep. Rage filled my body and without even thinking I punched her directly in her face and starting screaming again as her body dropped to the ground. I took her body and tied it to the bed and gagged her so that when she wakes up she can't open her stupid mouth and tell me to stop playing the most amazing game know as Monopoly for the Nintendo Switch. When I finally get back to my game my urge is so intense that I decided to start up a local multiplayer game with two players so that I would always be playing. After about five games with myself I started to calm down and I started to realize that life will be okay because I have Monopoly and I never have to stop playing. Its in the middle of the sixth game that my mom wakes up and I start to her her muffled screams and I tell her that she better shut up or I'll never let her go. After that she quiets down but little does she know that I will never let her go, I cannot risk letting her, or anyone for that matter, stop me from playing my game. Its now been ten days and I haven't stopped playing since I woke up that day I've lost track of how many games I've played. I haven't left my house and my friends seem to be worried about me because they've called my phone multiple times in the past hour but I don't have time to talk to people who don't love Monopoly the way I do. My mother stopped moving two days ago and is starting to smell but I don't care because I have everything I need, Monopoly.

WONDERFUL
Ambassing
a step by step guide on how to play nekopara vol. (whichever)  works even with the r-18 patch  1. buy the game (or pirate it...its up to you) 2. make sure everyone is out of the house or asleep  3. set your steam status to "offline"  (if not pirated) 4. disable discord activity status   (do it if pirated or not) 5. (required) USE YOUR GODDAMN HEADPHONES 6. close/lock your door (optional, and maybe your windows too) 7. (optional) set the chest bounciness all the way up 8. play for however long you want 9. prepare for situations of sudden footsteps/handle rotating sounds to alt-tab/minimize the game if playing on windowed 10. continue playing 11. when you had enough then close the game, and probably do something else  and then repeat the entire guide  if your relatives or cousins or anyone will have to use your pc, then please hide the nekopara games.  if your family will be dissapointed in you.....then idk, i guess you gotta live with it, if youre happy with bouncy big booba catgirls then....just tell them its non of their bussiness or tell them its for a school project and that you really like physics  although good game 10/10
no sex :(
i can't remember why i bought this but it has catgirls  10/10

I always play Nekopara when I feel like I'm back to square one, or at the lowest point of my life again. Thank you. No seriously. Thanks.

Better then drugs
Pet the Waifu
bad
catgirl
this is the best game ive ever played in my entire life, meow meow
How do I put this... These cats really crave a phallic object.   If you're expecting a good storyline, this might not be for you unless you like bottom of the barrel drama, if you're into seeing catgirls turn into horny "demons" that will suck soul out of you then... this game is for you.  This game will make you cry so I suggest having a box of tissues near you and preferably not having the bottom clothing on. Makes it more enjoyable, or so i've heard.
The horny never left...
A game where you met all kind of cute catgirls and watch them do cute things, there is no reason not to recommend it
cringe
nice
Before I played this I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
After playing this game, I felt so motivated. It changed my whole life, now I'm a successful person. I got 10 olympic gold medals, 6 Oscars and one nobel prize. Next year I'm planning to buy moon. It's all happened because of this amazing game. Thank you so much for having me to experience all of this truly wonderful family friendly game.
I hate my life.
So lewd and cute
Nekopara Review - 6/25/2022  Positives! Catgirls  Negatives! People find you weird for having this

Don't call PETA!!! They are just my NEKO Lovers.
Fun, and cute, I love the anime so I enjoy this aswell, but I wish the NSFW dlc was a setting to enable or not instead of a separate package :(
BRuh i put the this review on the wrong game. anyways This game is a fucking masterpiece. Cute nekos, Funny moments, AND a little bit of nsfw here and their Its just P E R F E C T. 10/10 would replay again FREQUENTLY
I love my kittens
i can explain
A work of art.
This game slaps, fuck you Toby.
The creator of this series needs to see a therapist.
good
i cant get the chinese achievement :(
I was in a dark place alright
Cut into my time trying to watch Morbius for the fifth time, achievement "Play on english didn't work". Best horror game ive played in years.

Don't have the adult pack so it unexpectedly turn into a Japanese learning game.
very good sex
Love the artwork and story and how each of the catgirls interact with eachother. I can tell the dev had fun writing this with the humor and what I felt was a 4th wall? with the fatty tuna joke. Coconut best girl.
A CAT IS FINE TOO...
Dialogue was sus but the soundtrack slaps. Here is one of my favorite songs from it:  Wash away the anger Here I stand beneath the warm and soothing rain The droplets falling gently down on the terrain Wash away the sorrow all the stains of time But there’s no memory it’s only dry inside  In the mud and sinking deeper Into a peaceful life  And it will come like a flood of pain Pouring down on me And it will not let up Until the end is here And it will come through the darkest day In my final hour And it will never rest until the clouds are clear Until it finds my dreams have disappeared  My dreams disappear
this has been the worst experience ive ever had in gaming history.. i love nekopara
ive watched the same scene 30 times
God tier game (esp with uncensor patch)
Better than Elden Ring
Cats №1
Jesus Approves.
...
Honestly a pretty good game if you ask me
Sadly the game is censored and there is no real warning that it is
my brain exploded while playing this game
I don't know how i got here
A great Cat Girl story if you have a mermaid to read it to you :) <3

I ALMOST DIED, WTF WAS THIS, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
bang ur cats the game
Truly a timeless masterpiece that will bring hopes and dreams to generations to come. This game will be the spark of a new revolution that will change life as we know it on our currently nekoless Earth. Through advanced gene editing using new found technologies involving CRISPR, we, nekoless plebians of this unfortunately nekoless universe, may too be able to experience the wonders of a nekoparadise with neko spanning as far as the eye can see. Sadly, I must concede that catgirls still share similarities with their human counterparts, the ever-elusive human female. I have never in my life felt the touch of a woman and such will likely be the case even with the introduction of catgirls into our planetary ecosystem... :( God, I'm so lonely. Please, God, why have you forsaken me?
shit
great
Fantastic game but not for everyone

yes
best nothing to say its good <3
Fun- and erotic
This is the best visual novel to learn Japanese  I've downloaded it to help me with my Japanese learning journey, and it's the best game ever for that! It lets you display both English and Japanese at the same time. You can also easily hide the English translation by pressing "J", and display it again by presssing "E" It's such a cool feature and I wish more game had it! The Japanese is pretty easy too, and you can replay the voiced line as much as you want The art is really cute too. I'm not really far into the story yet, but I do like the characters so far Highly recommend!
good
I’ve been obsessed with the Nekopara franchise, I got all the Vols and the DLCs, can’t wait for the 4th DLC to come 💕 I also watched the anime which was so lovely ❤️
Seriously great story with great characters. 10/10 would buy again

First one out of the storyline its an original what more is there to say.
Game was too difficult and not for me.
bulgarian cat rapist simultaor
wait when the fuck did i have this
a game that relaxes me^^
I just like looking at the pictures  edit: picture still hold up
only the sfw version for me is acceptable
an actual review (you shouldnt buy this) 1. funny for first 30 minutes 2. become cringe after that 3. becomes :skull: 1 hour in
I have an addiction
boobs
Amazing
how to hide steam game??????
Just opened the game and this theme hits so hard, could sit here for hours listening to it.
Being the first game in the series it sets the expectations high for the rest of the series, and while the 18+ dlc may turn ppl away from the series I would like to say that it is 100% optional and not having it doesn't take away from the story of the game at all (They made a Nekopara movie that was really good and it ignored all of the 18+ content)  Each cat girl is unique and their personalities are great. They are basically humans with a couple cat features that have cat instincts and its great.  Overall my only complaint is that Shigure is annoying, however she doesn't appear often and if she was removed odds are you wouldn't have this series at all, (shes also not a cat girl) so I'm willing to overlook it.  10/10 game, wish I could wipe it from my memory so I could experience it the first time again.
Game is nice
"4.7 Hours On Record"... (So Far)  Well Fek!...  I Told Myself I Wouldn't Get Too Invested Into The Nekopara Collection And Yet Here I Am With Almost 5 Hours Of Playtime, All Achievements Unlocked, And About To Buy The Next Chapter In The Nekopara Series...  What Can I Say Other Than I 100% Recommend Playing These Games...   Amazing Lore And Story And On Point Voice Acting Paired With Amazing Art Style And Ashetics...  Sure It Gets Lewd Towards The End Of The Game But The Story Outweighs The Lewdness...  I Recomended Not Playing This Game In Public Or Around People Who Would Find It Weird... Unless Your A Giga Chad Then Go Ahead, I Gave You Fair Warning...  Overall Would Recommend 10/10 The Ending Alone Would Make Me Buy The Rest Of The Games...
You came here for the catgirls. You get the catgirls.
voice acting with friends is hard I want no live now
i play this game for the story
10/10  would fuck catgirls again
Memories broken The truth goes unspoken I’ve even forgotten my name  I don’t know the season Or what is the reason I’m standing here holding my blade  A desolate place Without any trace It’s only the cold wind I feel  It’s me that I spite As I stand up and fight The only thing I know for real  There will be blood-shed The man in the mirror nods his head  The only one left Will ride upon the dragon’s back  Because the mountains don’t give back what they take Oh no There will be blood-shed It’s the only thing I’ve ever known.
Is cute
10/10 Wholesome, heartwarming journey.
very life changing
Uhh, I swear I got hacked and this game just appeared. (10/10 would [strike] nut [/strike] recommend)
when i talk about eating cat this is not what i mean at all :( and 10/10 very nice game
Catgirls and sex. What more can you want
Sometimes I hug my pillow and imagine I'm talking to Chocola for hours. I feel an inhuman sense of relation to this character I've projected my emotion and love onto due to my own fear and lack of companionship. The idea that I might have someone I could love in the way I love this fictional character is all that has kept me going and it's a horrible horrible reason that's perverted by my own selfish wants. I don't deserve someone like that and given what I've seen so far i don't think I'll ever find someone like that. My mental state has deteriorated over the past several years and my perception of reality is warped to the point where she literally feels real to me, her fluffy tail and her warm embrace feels so real which gave me both fear and comfort. Sometimes I listen to her voice saying: "There there don't you worry my lovely little boy, Chocola is here for you" while feeling her hands and tails wrapped around me. On December 9th, 2022, I'm going to take my medications and finally be removed from this schizophrenic hell that i'm slowly being sucked into.
i've lost my job, my sanity, my kids, my father, my mom, my parents, my parent 1. My .

HELP HELP HELP THESE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY
its alright ig...
four hours im never getting back
sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex
This game is so cute and sweet, bought since I watched the anime. Whoever says you need the nudity or the game isn't worth is is an idiot :)
this is the best game ever
This is easily gonna be one of my fav anime games :D its so CUTE 10/10 but if you do get it buy the 18+ DLC with it.
I hate (not) Sayori for putting me through this. Turned me into a delusional and madly obsessed with cats
i played this as a joke and now i have testicular cancer
Cat girls are cool
Beautiful
choatic catgirl harem + sussy sister?
Guilty pleasure  -Nekos
i am a minor and i still feel like i should be in jail playing this game
I can never get the time I spent on this game back. Anyways 10/10 I have lost everyone I love!
Damn I'm obsessed with catgirls again
never have i ever played a game with such riveting plot, when i downloaded the game i thought it was just some random anime game but little did i know it was also a very engaging and interesting forearm exercise that keeps me working at it for hours 10/10 would highly recommend. the cat girls are not bad either
Sure
Step 1: Launch game Step 2: Nut Step 3: Close game Step 4: Regret Nut  Step 5: Launch game
Love the Nekopara series <3
Naiiisu.. better story than twilight.
i wonder why my dad beats me with a belt everyday
catgirls uwu owo
hell naww y i wasted my time on this shi
Meow
Great.
GOOD game with quality dialogue and story telling narratives. Can say I've thoroughly studied all scenes and enjoyed every second of playing this game. my favourite cat girl is Chocola because i feel her character design is the most well rounded out of the two main characters presented in vol. 1. Overall I give NEKOPARA a 10/10 for a great and immersive cat girl experience.
Your little sister's age is "unknown".
고양이두 귀엽고 다 귀엽당~ 그래도 야한게 나와어 엄청 놀랐당 ＼(º □ º l|l)/
>Main character describes the "love interests" as his daughters. >Sleeps with both of them that week. >Little sister says she loves her brother in a similar way.  Incest is cringe and I cannot support this. Unfortunately, I spent the money on this game and waited about 2 months to do anything so now I gotta sleep in this shitty bed I pissed in because the sunk cost fallacy has me by the balls.  I also want to say the mechanics of cat girls in this universe make no sense and are fucking disgusting. Cat girls are: legally owned by people, are completely OK with this, are not allowed implicitly to be in public on their own, are not allowed to work for a wage by default, are required to test past this to gain these privileges-lest their cat-ish ways ruin human civilization-and after being allowed to exist and earn money, are required to wear a form of identification that also requires their exact position be tracked against their will, and finally, they are described, by themselves and people, to be more cat than human which is very fucking weird. The idea that they can be sex slaves though is completely fine, and they can become *extremely* attracted to someone simply by being nice to them during the correct season, as they are only horny when it's mating time. They have human reproductive organs, yet cat guys aren't implied to exist in this first game so I have no fucking clue how they reproduce since it is also stated they can't procreate with humans. Their development speed is also on par with cats, so a few month old cat girl appears as like a preteen human, so when they are physically mature they are basically a few years old at best. The most likely candidates for them to mate with are then their owners, which they have no problems with, and the owners see no issues with them having sex with a few-year-old basically cat since they happen to have human characteristics, despite the fact that having sex with a 2 year old human that looks 25 is just as bad as the regular kind of pedophilia.   I see this interpretation of cat girls as basically the *worst* way to do it, their just pets that look human basically. And, since they look human, there is reason for them to be able to do some human shit, though not out the gate as one wouldn't allow a regular cat to work for wage. Like damn this is not that good. Story is mid at best too so I really can not recommend this game at all.  Edit: This direct quote exists: "For me, [my cat girls] were still like children." -man fucking his cat girls.
bad game would never play nor pay for the 18+ patch definitively wouldn't put 60+ hours to the game
horny pastry puffer.
very game
yum
A science fiction story with a refreshing narrative. Morally positive and healthy.  Great thanks toNekoWorks for their efforts.
Pretty good visual novel. Character development is nice and the plot is interesting. Can't wait to find out what happens in volume 2!  Women are less likely to talk to me now
18+ is the only way to play this game
a favorite game of mine, going back after resetting my achievements and getting them again
Very relaxing story, still recommended if not purchasing with the patch
neko... good
Overall one of the best pure VN I've ever played.  No decisions, just a cute story with adorable cat girls.
not for the family
game so so bad so so bad
worth for playing 10/10 many waifu

It is rare that a video game makes me cry, and Nekopara was honestly the last place on earth where I expected this would happen. First off, I really enjoyed the cute graphics (sadly no ultra wide support), the dialogues are well thought out and the voice acting is overall very enjoyable (props to the person who voiced the fly!). What really went under my skin tough was how Chocolat and Vanilla express their affection and loyalty towards their master time and time again. I was especially surprised how sensual and honestly the scene was conveyed where Chocolat confesses her feelings for her master. It didn't feel distasteful or weird, but rather invoked a feeling of self-reflection in me, and I realized that being almost in my 40s, I will probably continue to live miserably until I die alone and unloved, while tears started to run down my face.  Well played Nekopara, well played. You took me to places I didn't expect nor wanted to experience, for that alone you deserve a solid 10/10.
I DON'T LIKE SEX
Super cute, love the character design

Jesus would get more believers if he was a cat girl.

Really enjoyable and funny. It would heal your mind.

I played this game as a sick dare from my friends on my birthday with the 18+ dlc. It was quite the sight to see if I do say so myself.
Women finally love me now 10/10.

I don't know why but I feel like the story is getting increasingly disturbing and annoying at the same time. Probably due to my thinking that the protag is just some random incel virgin loser that has been only imagining all of this (oh wow PLOT TWIST??). Putting that feeling aside, I guess Nekopara still deserves a round of applause for having adorbs character designs, epic voice acting, amazing OSTs and more plot than actual H+ scenes. 7/10.
I hate my life.
cats
saya sangat like
this may have been one of my biggest wastes of money and i didnt like seeing loli cat pussy on my screen every now and then. i 100% the game anyways 10/10 would recommend
I cummed to this game
Pretty good visual novel. Great English translation. I love the character design, both the visual and the written kind, as well as the art style. The story is also good.  The story here focuses on the two main girls, Chocola and Vanilla.  I can recommend it to everyone who likes nekos, lewd content or visual novels.  [i]Press [b]P[/b] to play the game the right way.[/i]
why couldnt i just die in the final chapter
catgirl sex
I like funny neko ;)
proper good scoff
What the f*** did you just f***ing post about me, you absolute beginner? I'll have you know I worked for ten of the biggest silicon-valley industry companies, and I've been involved in over two hundred top secret projects including NodeJS. I am trained in refactoring the most f***ed up code, and I'm the top C++er in the entire f***ing internet-connected universe. You are nothing to me, but just another IP. I will f***ing revoke your commits from your gitlab account with absolute dedication using only one Rasperry Pi client. Mark my f***ing words. You think you can get away with posting that s*** on one of my numerous very personal blogs? Your devices are f***ing bricked, kid. My attack software can be anywhere, anytime, and it is tasked to remove your entire git contributions from planet earth. Not only am I extensively trained in remote cross-firewall device-hacking, but I have access to over 100 of the United States CIA and NSA git repositories. If only you could have known what doom-bringing C-one-liner you have raised from my f***ing hands, maybe you would have held your fingers. But you could not. You did not. And now you're paying the price, noob. I will hail havoc upon your puny online-presence and you will drown in your own badly designed software. You're f***ing offline, kiddo.
got this game for sister cause she loves cats
This game kills more brain cells then huffing paint thinner, 10/10 would feel immense shame again.
This is just modern art

Cute Catpanions I like this game, it's so cute And the dlc, well good for keeping me awake o.o
[b] Do you like catgirls? [/b] [b] Do you like anime? [/b] [b] Do you feel lonely and want to fill the void in your heart somehow? [/b] If you answered "yes" to at least one of these questions, then chances are you're going to like this game.  [h1] Overview [/h1] This visual novel follows the story of Minaduki Kashou, a man who wants to open his own patisserie. As he moves out of his family home, where catgirls reside along with him and his sister, he finds out two of the catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, have decided to follow him, as they do not wish to be separated from him.  [h1] Story [/h1] The story is one the main points of focus of this game, it isn't complicated, and it doesn't have any sorrow instigating drama. While things don't always go perfectly, this story is one of those that just make you feel warm inside.  [h1] Gameplay [/h1] It is a visual novel, so the gameplay is about what you'd probably expect. Simple and compact, as that is all it needs to be.  [h1] Visuals and Audio [/h1] The art style and animations are very pleasant to the eye. The adorable catgirls' faces are bound to cleanse your soul. The UI is simple and attractively looking, though it might take a bit to get used to it at first. As for the voice acting, it is very well done, as you would find out especially if you had the 18+ patch.  [h1] Conclusion [/h1] It's a very enjoyable experience and I believe it is worth the 9,99€ you pay for this.
im alergic 2 catz
You don't need to like cats nor girls to like catgirls

efing good game
This a stright foward visual novel. you can autoplay it for the feel of seein an anime. The great point of this VN is the animation of the characters. It gives a fluid motion. the story is simple, but entertaining. there's a cliffhanger, wich means It's recomended get all the Nekopara Saga. Final score 8/10
i am now a heroin addict.
Good Evening, My Fellow Citizens: This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere. Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last Tuesday morning at 9 a.m., I directed that our surveillance be stepped up. And having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action, this government feels obliged to report this new crisis to you in fullest detail. The characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types of installations. Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles. Each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the southeastern part of the United States, in Central America or in the Caribbean area.  Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range ballistic missiles -- capable of traveling more than twice as far -- and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging as far north as Hudson Bay, Canada, and as far south as Lima, Peru. In addition, jet bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons are now being uncrated and assembled in Cuba while the necessary air bases are being prepared. This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base -- by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction -- constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Rio Pact of 1947, the traditions of this nation and hemisphere, the joint resolution of the 87th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own public warnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13. This action also contradicts the repeated assurances of Soviet spokesmen, both publicly and privately delivered, that the arms buildup in Cuba would retain its original defensive character, and that the Soviet Union had no need or desire to station strategic missiles on the territory of any other nation. ... But this secret, swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missiles -- in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy -- the sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for first time outside of Soviet soil -- is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country, if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by either friend or foe. ... Acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the Congress, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately: First: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.  Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military buildup. The foreign ministers of the OAS, in their communique of October 6, rejected secrecy on such matters in this hemisphere. Should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere, further action will be justified. I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities; and I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban people and the Soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing the threat will be recognized. Third: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union. Fourth: As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Guantanamo, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional military units to be on a standby alert status. Fifth: We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ of Consultation under the Organization of American States, to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty in support of all necessary action. The United Nations Charter allows for regional security arrangements -- and the nations of this hemisphere decided long ago against the military presence of outside powers. Our other allies around the world have also been alerted. Sixth: Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace. Our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba, under the supervision of U.N. observers, before the quarantine can be lifted. Seventh and finally: I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man. He has an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction -- by returning to his government's own words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory, and withdrawing these weapons from Cuba -- by refraining from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis -- and then by participating in a search for peaceful and permanent solutions. ... My fellow citizens: let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. Many months in which both our patience and our will will be tested -- months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing. ...  Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right -- not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved. Thank you and good night.
Everyone who says this game is bad is just lying or they have no soul.
This game saved my life. I have played this game for several hours straight and I have never been happier.  This game was the light in my life and my wake up call to just keep going in life and never looking back. What I once saw as fiction now seems possible this game really open my eyes, I can do anything.  I will continue to play nekopara, and so will the generations who come after me. Thank you, Nekoworks for such an awe-inspiring game.  Sincerely, Ozon
I can't get hard from real porn anymore

I just dont get it Story is mind numbingly boring about a guy who runs a Bakery with some catgirls and nothing happens. at least for the near 3 hours I played. You dont make any choices, you just read the story and I actually fell a sleep while playing this. This is for a certain type of gamer that isnt me.
[h1] Header text [/h1]
I recommend Nekopara Vol. 1 to everyone who loves a good adult story.  The game has a beautiful story and game is straight line story.  A very easy achievements to earn your ribbon.  I enjoyed my time reading all the words to the story.  Simply amazing.
Best game i played in my life :3

Bought it with reluctance. I now regret nothing.
[b]November 25th, 2021[/b]  "I guess now that we've come full circle, I should get you Volume 1 for the complete set, right?"  Again, I cannot verify that this was exactly what was said, but rather, an approximation. Another friend of mine that watched me read through Volumes 2, 3, and 4 was eagerly waiting in anticipation for my read-through of Volume 1, so he said something along these lines. A different friend had picked up the demo for this game, and I watched him go through this time (albeit only for a little bit, as I played through Volume 1 a bit later).  I was ready for a well deserved break following the rare strain of cringe that was Volume 4. Of course, that break didn't last very long. I was ready to get back into this series once again, but this time I took a little detour before getting back into the Visual Novels. I had discovered that there was not one, but MULTIPLE anime adaptations, the most prominent of which was by Funimation and not some rinky-dink backwater studio. I realized now that what I was dealing with was way bigger than I had initially thought, and was not just some niche indie project that had a small following. This series has sold 5 MILLION copies across 6 games, which blew my initial estimates out of the fucking water.  I watched the first few episodes of the Funimation anime (I eventually did finish it), and my expectations for how much I could cringe at a piece of media were proverbially flattened by an imaginary steamroller disguising itself as anime (I don't really care too much about anime as a genre one way or the other, but I can now see why some call it a 'mistake'). I knew I needed some more preparation before I could face this series again, so I decided to go with something more "tame" and watched the OVA.  However, when I watched the OVA, I noticed that the beginning was very similar to the demo of Volume 1 that my friend had played just days prior. I had now mistakenly obtained most of the knowledge I would've received from Volume 1 by watching an OVA that was one-fifth as long. The problem with this is that now I essentially had no reason to sit through Volume 1, making my experience with this game a particularly boring one.  But before I go into my actual thoughts on Volume 1 as a game, let's string off into yet another aspect of the series that spans more than just the volume in question. Now that I have exhausted the "gameplay", music, and main characters, lets talk about something more juicy that relates to the knowledge that this specific volume gifts you; (*cue fanfare*) the ethics of catgirls!   After my experience with Volume 2, I needed to know a few things about this universe, and most key among them were "What are catgirls anyway? Have they always been here? Were they engineered somehow? What sort of genetic makeup are we looking at here? Do humans reproduce with cat-people?"  I'm happy to report that finally, after 3 games and zero answers, Volume 1 has finally given me what I was looking for. (I know I could've started at the beginning and found this out a lot sooner, but don't forget that I wasn't originally expecting to play through the entire series)  What I am less happy to report, however, is what the answer actually is. I can sum it up for you in 4 words, taken from the actual game (yes, I did open it again for this review in order to check).  "genetically modified humanoid cats"  At first, genetically modifying cats sounds pretty bad, in my opinion. However, consider the alternative: "genetically modified catlike humans" instantly becomes way worse than modified cats, because that would involve some form of human genetic experimentation, possibly on live subjects, which is certainly not something one should be thinking of while one of the results of these experiments is loudly asking the main character about menstrual pads in public. However, this means that cat-people were [b]created[/b] to be human-like, but beneath humanity as a sub-class of citizen, which is a tragic tale when put in that context.  But now, there comes a new dilemma: what if instead of animal experimentation they instead decided to trace the origin story to cat-people that evolved naturally? Well that opens a new can of worms in the game's universe, since if you remember my volume 2 review, I discussed that the society is set up very similar to a slave society, with catgirls legally unable to do anything independently (a situation that is relevant in Volume 1, surprisingly). So now, the human race essentially has enslaved parts of themselves and cast one race on top of another as the "owners" while independence of the lower caste is illegal, and I don't think I need to explain why that's bad.  That leaves us between a rock and a hard place in how to approach the origins of catgirls. Either they were created in a lab with animal experimentation with the expressed purpose of creating a new pet with human features (often to used to fulfill some kind of sexual fantasy), stripping them of rights that would ordinarily be granted to humans (and since it is revealed that catgirls were typically homeless strays until recently, neglected by the very experiment that brought them into existence), [i]OR[/i], there is a forceful enslavement of humans over cat-people, dehumanizing them and restricting their independence until they are little more than common pets. Nekopara has elected to adopt the first option as the canonical origin story, but both of these options are questionable, neither of which, in my opinion, take a clear moral high ground over the other.   But enough of my silly rant, let's examine the game now, shall we.  As I mentioned earlier, I had seen the OVA before playing Volume 1, so I already knew what was going to happen, and the experience was relatively boring compared to going in without previous knowledge. However, even in isolation of this fact, Volume 1 is easily the weakest of the main Nekopara series (I say 'main' because there is a worse entry with the "Nekopara" name). The story was the least interesting, largely settling into generic misadventures with Chocola and Vanilla, with occasional references to their backstory and strong attachment to Kashou, which largely feel shoehorned in and contrast poorly with the rest of the story. The only part I'd call passable is the ending, when the catgirls commit a felony by leaving the house without bells, and even then it wasn't very good. I largely feel this was done poorly because Chocola and Vanilla are not well written characters in Volume 1. They lack little human characteristics to make them feel real, which I guess was kind of the point in making them cats. However, later games in the series take more and more gradual steps to make the catgirls feel more human, which makes for more interesting stories later down the line. Even Chocola and Vanilla receive some of these characteristics in later entries (and even the anime, to an extent), and that ultimately improves the quality of these characters. Their characters in Volume 1, however, boil down to little more than "I wuv master uwu cuz he took care of me when I was sick :3 and i wanna have sexy time with him~". I wish there was more to it than that, but other than that, their characters are literally no different than an actual cat; acting on their instincts with 0 regard for those around them, a characteristic even a side character catgirl (who came back in volume 2 renamed "Milk") is better at hiding than these two.  I was unimpressed by Volume 1, and had I started here the proper way instead of looping around via later games I'd likely be unmotivated to continue. However, in this game I received answers to many (but not all) of my questions that had been lingering since I started with Volume 2, which I consider both a blessing and a curse thanks to this. My journey is still not over, but the end is in sight.  tl;dr: nya nya catgirl game 1 answers questions but is boring. watch OVA instead. 4/10
What if all our technology were designed by people who love us? How would the world be different? Who do you wish would make it for you? Who would you make it for? Enter NEKOPARA- of the people, by the people, for the people.
The game is amazing and adorable

I bought this game as a joke, and now I don't think it's a joke anymore.
Very good game, fun, and neko
The best game ever, i could do this all day.  11/10, neko is everywhere.  [spoiler] If you buy 18+ DLC it is become better [/spoiler]

UwU
Spending Valentine's Day with my cute catgirls was one of the best decisions I made in my life.
Fun game. Has a mix of cute, wholesome fun, and sweet, sexy lewd fun.
It cool
porn
Its like an aquarium where all the fish are eating each other. I hate it. I'm not trying to be funny i am actually disgusted. i had to go the doctor and this game gave me ED.    PSA: get your catgirls spayed and neutered.
........ i love the story
I think wearing headphones might have been a good idea
Bro, just do it...  If your looking at this game we both know your a weeb and you want to lewd some nekos
This is the most restrictive kinds of visual novel, with no choices, just clicking to progress to the next bit of dialogue where Japanese voice actresses will shout "NYAAAA" again for the 30th scene in a row. It's cute I guess but the plot is meandering. Even if it's slice of life something has to happen besides catgirls alternately trying to seduce you and scolding you for being a pervert. I'll say this, it has the most dynamically animated characters in any VN I've ever played. That was interesting, but not worth sticking it out for the rest.
Would Recommend
BONK! go to horny jail.
damn gud
BEST GAME EVER but there is one problem tho, catgirls are not real :(
Cute catgirls are always good to see uwu
I just played it for the achievements i swear!
For people looking for an actual review that isn't memes.  This game is a very good story game. (think of it more as an anime, movie or book. You have no control over what happens. You just click and the story continues.)  The storyline is very well written and I would recommend playing it at least once for the experience. for the people who want sexual content the DLC has you covered (there is no sexual scenes without the DLC but it is very heavily implied without it). Would recommend playing nekopara 0 first before you play nekopara 1 to understand whats going on. In my personal opinion I would recommend buying it if you are interested in these types of games or content. It is deaf friendly with subtitles in 3 languages (English, Japanese and Chinese) it is best to read the dialog as what the dialog says is not animated in most of the time and instead is just an image of the characters on screen it is very much like a picture book.  THIS IS NOT A KIDS GAME DESPITE THE BRIGHT COLORS DO NOT PLAY IF YOU ARE UNDER 18! rating 8/10 would recommend
ok
This is amazing 20/10 I recommend, I don't have any problems.
It was hard to enjoy this.  Kashou is a bit of a pushover and doormat. His underage sister Shigure is tsundere, creepy and invasive, and wants to fuck him. Chocola is loud and annoying, and Vanilla gets a little mean-spirited later on. The game/dialogue is *constantly* saying "They're acting like this because they're catgirls", as though to continuously reference and remind me of the point of the game, and one of those traits gets completely contradicted later on anyways ([spoiler]they're honest because they're catgirls, but Vanilla lies about something she gets embarrassed about[/spoiler]). The catgirls are compared to daughters immediately after a sex scene ([spoiler]since Kashou did raise them from their childhood, oh also they're twin sisters yet they interact sexually with each other[/spoiler]). They occasionally say "no, stop" during sex which isn't respected at all, and they're extremely shrill and high-pitched during it. They act young and naive, almost child-like at times, [spoiler]because catgirls have less intelligence than humans[/spoiler], which is not a turn-on at all.  I know that the incest, loli-bait, screeching during sex, and violating consent is all normal for hentai, but it's still not enjoyable. I also think this is important to know, because every other review is just dumbass jokes and won't talk about the actual damn game.
My parents have abandoned me
Inspiring. Wholesome. Life Changing
I got this as a gift and I voice acted it with my friends for a bit, then I stopped and never played this game. Ever. again. Each and every day I am kept up at night with the fact that this game still sits in my library, laying there dormant just waiting for me one day to boot it up and play it. I tremble and twist and churn in my despair and fear of this game so much so that I dare not play video games because of it. My blood freezes cold, coiling into an eternal freeze as I consider putting myself through the loop of ending the nightmare, but I relent as Christ has saved me and died for me.... but even then I tremble at this horror that has consumed me.  cute and funny game! Don't buy the 18+ DLC. Degenerate.
uhhhhhh
i have never seen a woman
I am down bad
best 30 $ i've ever spent in my entire life
A good quality visual novel, although a bit pricy.
story is cute, catgirls are cute, worth the dollar i spent on it
jail.
kewt
Very Enlightening
a
Lol not sure how this game ended up in my library but what can I say... It's a very shallow game that goes all in on the cutesy stuff, so if you're not into it than there is not much else there unfortunately. Most of the games budget is spent on the animation and music, both of which are actually pretty good, comparable to most anime of its genre. Where the game falls short however is the lack of player interaction, in that there really isn't anything for the player to do other than turn the page. This is a short coming that games like "Doki doki Literature club", or "Long live the Queen" really understood and addressed to such an impressive degree that they put many of these older titles to shame. I could also complain about the nonsense dialogue or the lack of a story but then again I don't understand women or cats in real life either so maybe it adds up, and I've also seen worse writing than Nekopara... looking at you "Cats 2019"
I bought this Title 4 Years ago... Now I played it, and I am asking myself just one question. WHY DID I WAIT 4 YEARS TO PLAY THIS!?!?  My rating: YEP Bouncy Catgirl Boobs :3
Imma be honest here between all these meme reviews:  I played the whole thing and it was really fun. While i installed the uncut-patch, i did so mainly because i heard dialogue and certain jokes would also be censored. But the H-Scenes are pretty good nonetheless.   Anyway, it´s a cute story. I enjoyed playing (well more like reading) through it. The Live2D adds a lot. Other VNs are a lot more static and feel like more of a drag. Even the sound-design was pretty good for something that simple. I really liked it for it´s story, which probably nobody will ever believe.   It was short, well and thoughtfully presented and extremely sweet.
It's not a problem, It's a hobby.
my life is complete
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry for being such a disappointment.
You either finish the game, or the game finishes you.
I constructed a gaming rig, comprised of money I had saved up for some time. I wanted to be spec'd out so I got everything, I7-7700k, with an AIO liquid cooler running 5.0ghz, A GTX 1080 Ti FE running stock clocks, 16 gb of 3200 mhz ram, an m.2 ssd,an awesome RGB Msi motherboard, a Thermaltake case with GPU sidemounting. Y'know, the cool stuff back when I built it March of 2017. That GPU was bought right when they came out!!   All this power, and I'm here. Playing THIS game. And I am not as dissappointed as my friends and family are. I have come to acceptance of this fact. Me and my bloody ears from first time launch. Thank you NEKO WORKs for bringing such a piece of art to a platform such as steam.
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199225443756
Played it for a second, It's okay I guess
went in expecting a 10/10, left with a 12/10. Very nice
even though nekopara is less of a game and more of a visual novel, its still very good and wholesome. granted i may be biased cause im a simp but from an unbiased standpoint it is very nice and wholesome 10/10
Ok let me tell you something. I was 30+ years old depressed guy, absolutely no luck with women, had few friends, no perspectives in life. I had never watches hentai or played these type of games.  So sitting there in my chair, feeling bad about myself I decided "why not?". And found this little gem.  So I started reading it like a book and it felt great. The story was simple but felt deep. And when I reached the hentai part my brain said: "Ok, this is so ***ed up, if you'll do this, there is no going back".  I sat there for a minute analyzing my life and concluded that it doesn't matter, because my life is already ***ed up, why stop now. And I went with it.  And boy did it feel GREAT! So many new emotions lit up inside me I never knew existed! It felt ecstatic!  The overall experience playing this game was out of this world.  So what about me now, couple of years after? I still have zero luck with women, but made some new friends, have a good job, and enjoying myself. And this game is partly responsible for upping the quality of my life.  That's all I have to say.
It was ok...

when i die, let this game be burned with me
yes good game, i like catgirls
A solid story, amazing artwork and impeccable voice acting. Highly recommended!
If you then this is the game for you!
Lord forgive me, for I have sinned.
Great animation on the sprites
the best first-perspective-shooter game as a masterpiece in the world and paradise！
10/10 got me a girlfriend
fully 1 handed playstyle compatible.
I love cat girls
Go to horny jail!
I still like cats
Great exercise for your dominant arm 10/10
good
Very wholesome
I quit after eight minutes.  These fucking mutants tried to sleep in my bed.  Gross.
Buy this game. Or don't. I don't care anymore.  It used to be that I got home from work and the only thing I'd want to put in my mouth was the cold barrel of my grandfather's shotgun. Then I discovered anime catgirl tiddies, and now there are two things.
Unethical method of torture.  I do not consider myself to be well acquitted to anime. However, I was given this game to play by a friend. They know who they are. It definitely comes with a lot of content to view and, see persay. The plot is actually quite good, I think the storyline is solid enough on its own.   The visual content is, interesting. In general, it is quite a long period of boredom, reading, then visual content that reminds you of what you are playing. Each to their own is the best way to summarize this. If you or your friends are not into anime, this is a viable method of torture - which to put on paper is the only reason I'm upvoting this.
It's a visual novel starring catgirls. What more do you need to know?  Two paws up!
i'm no longer going to pretend this isn't on my steam library
I was only 40 years old  I loved Nekopara so much, I had all the bodypillows and figurines  I pray to Neko Works every night, thanking them for the waifus that I’ve been given  “Azuki is love” I say, “Coconut is life”  My mom hears me and calls me a parasite  I knew she was just jealous of my devotion to Nekopara  I called her a baka gaijin  She slaps me and sends me back to the basement  I’m crying now, and my face hurts  I lay down next to my Chocola bodypillow, and it’s really cold  Suddenly a warmth is moving towards me  It’s Neko Works  I am so happy  They whisper in my ear “This is my bakery”  They grab me with their powerful Developer hands and start up my computer  I’m ready  I open up my storage space for Nekopara  It starts to download  It takes so long, but I do it for Nekopara  I start to breath harder as the download bar nears completion  I pound on my kotaku  I want the nekos now  Neko Works meows a kawaii meow as Nekopara finishes downloading  My mom walks in  Neko Works looks her straight in the eye and says “3D women are ugly”  Neko Works leave up the stairs  Nekopara is love. Nekopara is life
Amazing game, perfect for the whole family (incl. H-patch) 13/10 would play again with my mother
Kinda fie ngl
Yes
I like the story 8/10
i love them
Extremely wholesome and adorable story line with the atmosphere. Like who wouldn't want to run a bakery with cute af cat girl maids?!  Yet I still wasn't satisfied with the whole experience due to the lack of choice making or lacking any gameplay what so ever. Felt more like reading a manga or watching a really cute anime series.
This game actually makes me want to go outside and touch some grass.
this game is going to turn me into a catgirl... i don't want that to happen ffs
sex.

There are two reasons why you will play this game: 1. You're a man o culture (and a     h o r n y       one) 2. You love good histories with lovely characters.   I'm in group 2. I didn't buy the DLCs, and I won't.   I will say why this game is so wonderful  All characters are unique, each one of them has a nice history. Including the main character. You will enjoy, laugh, cry, ship, be angry and so much more!  There is a LOT of catgirls, and this is wonderful, I must say!  Again, if you are only on the 1 first group.... buy the DLCs and... well... enjoy, I think? I only played for the reason 2, I can't say much.  If you are in the group 2... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  And now the reason that SURLY will make you play this game: CATGIRLS  PS.: My favourite one is the 4 (until now) PS.2: Waiting for the 5.
The story is boring, the characters are not very likable. I understand the aim of the game, and understand it was not necessarily meant for players like me, but it feels like the erotic content was the main aim of the game, and the story progression was just something going on in the background. It was cute and all, but I just don't think it was a good story. THIS IS JUST AN OPINION. IT IS NOT MEANT TO ATTACK PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THIS SORT OF GAME, it's just so people who are looking for an engaging story know this is not necessarily it.
Cute cat girls do I need to say more?
i was forced to play this
is there a way to skip the extremely graphic sex scenes. I want to play this with my little cousin and I don't want his eyes to be exposed to giant anime breasts.
Highly recommended to play with your family, specially when you buy DLC, have fun, cuz i had
waifu = Maple = catgirl with the sexiest moan and nyaa ♥  [i]i miss the 18+ version even the adult content dlc is with mosaic >:([/i]
game is very bad do not buy  how to refunding?
woof woof
Getting the 18+ DLC is actually compulsory

BEST FPS GAME EVER
U U U U U U U!
this is my favorite game, there aren't any games better than this
(∩˃o˂∩)♡
I have lost all dignity.
yes
Just realized that Steam literally cut out all the H scenes and I was left wondering why nothing happened after making out with the catgirls like in Tiananmen square. Anyone got patches for the scenes?
≧◡≦
cat girls suck and you should be ashamed to fap to this
I have no friends
best shooter ever
yes.
Good game.
People who played this game don't have a dad       I don't have a dad
played for nearly two hours until i realized there's zero choices or interactions. probably should have found more info about this game before buying the bundle because it's barely even a game. not sure what the value is in buying this instead of just watching a full playthrough on youtube or something instead.  besides the gameplay (or lack thereof), i had no idea the story was going to be so creepy. the narrator goes out of his way to establish himself as a brotherly and/or fatherly figure for these characters who act like 8 year olds, and then he ends up having sex with them?? feels bad man. im glad i could get a refund at least
I spent two hours reading out the dialog on discord for a lot of laughs   10/10 would recommend  and cute girls winkyface
100% completion in ~7 hours -It has been years since I finished Vol.1 but i never finished the rest of the series so I am coming back to get a fresh start. -Art is very clean and vibrant. -Dialogue is humorous and tells a cute lighthearted story. -Boob physics. -Catgirls.
I might like cats.
So far, this is the best game I've ever played! Nyah~~ ^_^
home sweeet japan
This game is a masterpiece, up there with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, God Of War and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. To experience all this game has to offer, I would recommend the 18+ pack as it adds essential lore to Chocolas backstory. I played this with my boys via Discord and we all 100% agree that this game is indeed a work of art.

THERE IS A VOICE ACTOR FOR A FLY. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU *HAVE* TO EXPERIENCE.
I love this game, its fun to play and my favorite Character is Vanilla or Coconut. This game is also Cute and Adorable but i don't waste hundreds of hours on this -_-.
When I was told that I had 1 month to live, I thought to myself what should I spent that time on. I have had a intreset in anime since the young days, and I like cats. So this is like bread and butter. After 1 week of playing the nekopara series, my doctor told me I was all good. Thanks nekopara for saving my life <3
Good Game
anime
0/10 I hate my country. Enjoy your availability to porn/hentai as long as your country doesn't piss around because human beings have sexualities. Or do some preventive work and cut your dick/balls/clit off to never think about sexual pleasure ever again. The game doesn't make any sense without the "plot". First they chill in the bakery, suddenly they are all in bed, family friendly ofc.  My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, fck germany.
Do I wish I was a catgirl? Yes. Absolutely.

This is my dream game, my childhood dream of having segs with cats is finaly coming true in a virtual form
I had so much sex after playing this game.
Great game but after 2h I found out that steam version do not have s*x scenes and Its censored. Im mad because I bought eroge game with no nudity. Wau modern age is so great
8/10
Noiceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee game lul,
this was my christmas present.
I love the story. It's amazing.
Recommend for fellow neko lovers~ :3  very fuwa fuwa
Don't let the 720p graphics and outdated petting mechanics fool ya, this game is deep and the world is really immersive. The beginning feels magical as you get off the car and see the bizarre world of Patisserie La Soleil for the first time. SO MANY UNIQUE CATGURLS, MEOWS, PURRS, GURUGURUGURUS which in my opinion Amairo Chocolate / Neko-NIN (mostly Amairo Chocolate) could have enhanced on much better, but those feel like a generic catgurl setting and a little lacking on that (of course those 2 games have something unique about them too). This game on the other hand is unique in so many ways that you just got to play it. The soundtrack is as good (if not better) as the other games, and they are so befitting of the themes of NEKOPARA. The game does a really good job of taking you from a low level bakery owner to basically a bakery demigod  Generally speaking: this game is unique and amazing. Play it. the low-res graphics and mechanics sometimes are a turn off, and imo just try bearing with it because nearing the middle / end of the game the game just gets better and fun. use Chest Bounciness (a slider that improves the games graphics and bewba fixes) if you are ok not having the "vanilla experience".  100/10 (a 4K version of the game would be so cool!)

This is my fourth playthrough, though first playthrough on this account.  good game would play again  I play christmas each year, this is my third  wholesome stuff
God help the voices wont stop they're coming they are coming
I regret nothing.

I question my life a lot
I believe in catgirl supremacy.

Please help.
The art and quality is good, but i dislike how it's kind of sexualized.

Good Game 10/10 Story
this gaem is very awesome!!!11!!!!!1!
Nekopara is my favorite visual novel series, i bought the first one as a joke but the story is extremely good. Vanilla and Chocola are my favorites.
Amazing
I am very pleased with what I'm seeing in this game.
Yeah
i liked the story
This game makes me want to put a toothpick under my toenail and kick a wall

Despite loving anime women.... the game is crap. It reads like some teenager going "through changes" wrote it. The levels of cringe are so high I gag.

neuron activation
why
What the fuck am I doing with my life
why does this have so many positive scores? this is without a doubt the worst visual novel i've ever read, story wise. it's so painfully boring. the only reason anybody likes it is for the porn scenes. there are many better VNs on steam, shame this is the one that got popular.
yes
sex
Best game ever. 10/10    I wish Catgirls were real..
yes.
i have ascended
Pretty epic cool
😳😺🥵
hot
Great VN with great voice acting and catgirls. What else could you want? Definitely install the R18 patch online though or buy it on steam. One downside I will mention is that one of the achievments which is 'try playing it in English' is kind of broken and took a bit of meddling with the unlock.
Neko, cake and fun. 10/10
I initially made my friend buy this game for me as a joke... And i hate to admit this- but i actually really enjoyed it. I was hooked on the story immediately. The voice acting is a great, the character synergies are great, the story is great. I love the characters and the heartships they went through here. Def a game worth checking out if you're into these kinds of games. I wasn't into these kinds of games at first but this one got me hooked.
Every day. We stray further from god.
You know why you're here. Catgirls

Neko girls, 10/10.
Absolute masterpiece, beat the first 6 days of DDD to this game Actually has plot for a catgirl game. My gf no longer loves me but I have catgirls now so that's all that matters.   10/10
I speedran the other games with my boys, what a night
I definitely bought this game for the plot. Definitely...  (Maple is just better)
cum
I can't stop playing this amazing title. I've been obsessed with the exceptional writing, amazing artwork, and fantastically attractive characters. Honestly, It is my favorite title available on Steam. I'm excited to see this developer's future work!
Vanilla best girl
舍友问我为什么对着屏幕傻笑
my worst financial decision  I love it
Cartier God - Let Me Go (Ft. Bladee)
Quality game. Nothing much needs to be said simply,"You are a horny pastry puffer." And that perfectly describes me.
*смешная шутка в обзоре*
mmmm kat
this game was gifted to me
Masterpiece
it was alright i guess
Cat girls lol
Wholesome.
It brought my relationship with jesus christ to be a lot stronger after completion.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Amazing game with an amazing story.

this game makes me horny
Very nice
I was a fool to think it was only a "cute cat girl" game, i'm gay now and sending money to Elon Musk.
remember to neuter your cat
Great game for the Family!   Play with your   kids/wife/dad/mother/grandmother/grandfather/uncle/aunt/brother/sister/pets/family

best for japanese leaner
the best game
cat girl anime tidd
Catgirls
very good, satisfies me
Best game
Can't pet the catgirls. >.<
No choices, it's not a game. What's the point of having multiple saves if you literally can't interact with the story in any way? I bought this pretty close to the release date because a guide popped up talking about different endings and choices, i hate whoever made that guide as it made me waste 10€.
Tiddies
Roses are red Violets are blue. Maple & Coconuts are the best nekos.

ZAMN shes 12??????
best game ive ever played 10000/10
Spectacular.
as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome, one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her, i have sex with women, not men. i am not gay. I am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy, my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women, every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex, i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.
Mm, catgirls Good game with the 18+ patch
cat
Very family friendly game, show it to your one creepy uncle at a family gathering and he'll be elated!
I'm still waiting for my cat turning neko girl. Anytime soon.
They had 1 job, and it was to not describe their relationship as a father daughter. You see the issue with describing it as such? Even if its a bad translation from weeb to engrish, it turns it from questionable to disgusting.
This is where the fun begins ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) [spoiler] (with Chocola and Vanilla) [/spoiler].  Simple H visual novel with catgirls, however, there's no headpat but there's our old friend chest bounciness.

Catgirls are goddesses!

cat girls r ruining my life <3 <3 vol 1.. introduction to d cat girls :0 hello
This has been the best game i have ever played, too sad i had to refund it as soon as possible because i didn't have money for internet, this is the worst one i have played so far
discord mods simulator
Yes WTH am i so happy? OMG
As soon as I saw it was still censored even with the paid 18+ DLC it was uninstalled.  Not recommended at all.
I had some money left over from a gift card and was recommended this game as a challenge. I regret this decision and I am actively seeking a way to rid my account of this spawn of satan. If anyone has any clue onto how i be rid of this vile evil please let me know.
can play with one hand
suprisingly good story
The time has finally come... Nearly 5 years after initially launching Nekopara, I finally finished it. Don't ask me how  time flew by this quick with me postponing it, but you know what they say... If you start doing too many new things you tend to not finish em all, so after I now gave it a revisit, there was no doubt in my mind about finishing it once and for all and there is no doubt in my mind that I will shortly after finish the rest of the volumes as well! Now with the talk of personal nostalgia and love for the series out of the way, lets talk about what makes Nekopara so great. I mean you already know it, but this is a recommending review... This is where I give out all the praise for the visual novel like Kashou gives his praise to Chocola and Vanilla. The artwork is and will always be ridiculously cute. The soundtrack makes you move along and the interface, the visuals are one of the prettiest and cleanest I've seen in a visual novel. The characters show various movement; when they talk, expressions, when they move from one place to another etc. ALSO JIGGLE PHYSICS!! Can't forget about the jiggles. The characters (mainly Chocola and Vanilla of course) are beyond cute [spoiler]and so is the love between themselves and Kashou[/spoiler]. It seriously melts your heart to a point of even a little bit of jealousy; who wouldn't wanna be there and just cuddle the two catgirls for hours on end. Its a great love story, really. However, Id be lying if I said I came for the love story. You come for the sex scenes and you stay for the love story..... and the scenes.. POINT IS! The scenes are the longest and most passionate (AND partially animated) I've seen so far in a visual novel, and really make you feel as lewd as the characters are in the moment, or so I liked to think anyway.  Very cute and heartwarming love story and artstyle, combined with extremely lewd, cute and sexy scenes of love making, not to mention last but in no way least, CATGIRLS. All weeb jokes aside, you can't deny that a catgirl (or two) is all you need (cause they're unobtainable, coming back to earth *bonk*) and clearly superior in cuteness levels to any normal girl. This is without a doubt one of my favourite visual novel series and aside from the infamous mosaic censor (damn you, laws of Japan!), I really have no complaints. 11/10.
love the sex scenes, hate the women. UwU~
This is how japanese people trick you to read books.
Nekopara Volume 1 was surprisingly wholesome while not making any actual choices the e-mote system and [spoiler]p-key[/spoiler] make it more immersive and fun. all in all good story, funny, wholesome(with the exception of Cinnamon, and Shigure she creepy lol). This is a good spent 6 hours of my life!!

Amazing game, 100 percent would recommend. Looking forward to play all of them :3

Gotta be the most cutest visual novels with the best price to offer, love it

had to lock the door for this one
yeay
wait this isn't melty blood this is cat porn
sucks
Nekopara is a game where Mario travels across Skyrim to stop Senator Armstrong from collecting all the chaos emeralds. this game has the exaggerated swagger of too much water and has 16 times the detail.  but in all seriousness, Nekopara is very wholesome and Chocola and Vanilla are very cute, would recommend.
I haven't touched a girl in 5 years.
god has abandoned us
it's pretty good
life changing
fun
Nice.
Been in this game for 30 minutes. First conclusion that I've drawn: the protag is a d1ck. Let's hope he'll better himself, cos I can't stand this guy at all.  EDIT: Chapter 2. This guy is an actual a$$hole. Who wrote this guy?????
epicly
Hahahaha I watched HENTAI hahahahaha
im not a wise man but i dont think this is roblox squid game
no I don't have a problem shut up it's not my fault the catgirls are hot I didn't make them it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault it's not my fault
boring imo. Only used it for japanese.
Excellent characters, excellent music and astoudingly good art. One of the most high-quality, high-effort Visual Novels I've played in some time.   I'd really advise against getting the +18 patch though. A lot of people could argue that the whole "heat" arc was essential to the plot, but I think these were made just for the sake of fanservice and do not actually contribute anything meaningful to the story or overall game. They're just SO stretched out, awkward and plain unpleasant. One of the few ocassions where I would intentionally turn down and skip hentai scenes in a VN, or any game for that matter.  Aside from that though, it's a solid 8/10. Definitely worth the purchase
One of the best games i have ever spent my money on well worth the $10 this game got rid of my depression and has helped me live my best life i am now a husband with 2 kids thanks to this game it has really helped me improve my life and turned it around
I didn't read any of the dialogue
i like the comedy, how they add the details in act or conversation its so fun. the plot is great but just like another slice of life story yups the mainstream one. up to you if you like it or not its all about the preference, but hell ye it nekos just enjoy it
yes
Let me spin you a tale of my life. Back when I was a lad somewhere in my first or second year of highschool a friend said, "hey, do you want Nekopara?" and I, being the innocent pure lad I was, said "sure" because I thought, "man this'll be funny to have." So I had it, and I sat on it, then sometime later I say "haha you know what would be really funny? If I got all the achievements" so I booted up Nekopara and spammed my way through the game, ultimately taking up three hours of my life. All achievements unlocked and three hours on my account. It was at that point that I realized something. How can people tell I was joking? I tell friends this story but part of me worries "what if they don't believe me? what if people start thinking that I actually wanted a visual novel about catgirls? What do I do now?" To tell you the truth I still have no answer to that question, but, it was free, and it led to a friend gifting me "Slender: Hentai Edition" several years later. So, in the end I may forever be tainted in the eyes of others, but I got free stuff, and for me, the greedy rat bastard I am, that's a good deal. But to be completely honest, do I recommend this? Eh, it's not really my thing, but if you're reading reviews with the hope of finding out if it's actually good or not I just gotta say: come on man. You know what you're getting, descend into degeneracy or rise above us plebians who forever have our libraries stained by the Japanese catgirls.
(pro tip) lock your door before playing
The single greatest game on the planet Earth.
Lasted 30 minutes before the game hit me in the face with the fact that the catgirls age like cats and not humans. So pedophillia and beastiality are also basically at play too. Brilliant gag gift/10, will inflict on others in time.
As long as you don't live in Germany, Nekopara is a very good game. Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to see 2D anime cat girl tiddies. I damn you, German Federal Agency for Child and Youth Media Protection!  I give an 8.5/10
The all ages version on Steam is miles better in my opinion, the art is great but storywise the R18 content on the game just feels way too forced, and if you want visual novels with more "spicy" content there are better options, artstyle is great tho, I'll give it a recommendation due to those things combined.
uwu
This game is more effective then a condom and birth control combined
awooga
There is a jojo reference
.
i play for the story i swear
I love this game that's all
The real challenge of the game is streaming it somewhere without getting banned.
Very nice
I used to be a dog-person... Not anymore
Neko girls... whats not to like?
What is the scene from the end of chapter 1......................... jesus I need holy water
Very comfy and good to play on a lonely night
Short, sweet and fun, Nekopara has the best cat girls. Around ~3.5h of nothing but cat girls being cute, also Vanilla is number 1 waifu.  I already bought the other games :D
Man I just wanted cute anime neko maid girls. Didn't know pedophilia and incest were apart of that package. Main girl characters are mentally and physically 14 despite being 9 months (I think?) old, have literally just started puberty, and refer to you as their brother. You fuck them (heavily implied, at least). Should've done my research.
Magnificante
It was slow, with not much boobie going on. Pretty well written, price is a little high for what you get. I recommend hentai police instead.
For anyone who is playing this, God is watching you :/
Great art, great music, great performances.
Very good game especially loved those scenes
i saw cat boobs
This game saved my life.  I am 31.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you
Is that what the Japanese like? Unbelievable but i like the game, not japanese people  buy NOW
Well ive only did 0.5 hours on this game, my dad walked into the room. He said "Why did i steal you from the clearance isle in Walmart"    Im hurt.
!!NEKO!! that is all.

H-how do some of you all have over 100 hours in this?
Sex , cat , good.
When God created man, he had not intended for him to fall so far from his grace. But it is the undeniable truth that man had been persuaded to consume the flesh of the fruit which had been given to him by the devil; so too will the children of man be deceived.
Bought the each volume with high hopes, so far i am not disappointed at all! Vol 1 was great along with vol 0 to introduce us to the minaduki family, the 18+ dlc added the extra spice i desired to be honest ;) Absolutely recommend it for everyone considering to purchase it, Catgirl supremacy is forever!
good
:)
So, in short this is a high quality 4-6 hour erotic Visual Novel for cat lovers. If you have a cat, you'll like this game.  [Noteworthy Stuff]:  -You need to buy an 18+ patch to scene any lewd content.  -There's a total of 3 s*x scenes that play out towards the later hours, all of which you can revisit in a CG Gallery, Scene Gallery, and Video Gallery at the title screen. They're mostly pictures but a few parts in the scenes have *thrusting*. All 3 are fairly long with quite a bit of text and dialogue to go with it.  -Fully voiced (in Japanese) for all characters except you (i read my parts out loud for deeper immersion) [but i read them in english so idk if my catgirls understood me...]  -At the title screen, in 'Extras', there's a CG Gallery, Scene Gallery, Music Gallery, And Video Gallery. They all unlock as you progress.  -There's a slider where you can adjust how bouncy the breasts are. Also, press P at any given time to make them bounce at will. With great power, comes great responsibility... (!!!)  -It's a straight VN, so there's no interaction or dialogue options. It's pretty text heavy and you gotta play a while before you hit the lewd scenes. Think of it like a manga but with jiggle physics ^.^  -There's a Log where you can backtrack to re-read stuff but no 'back' button to rewind scenes like in other VN's. There's also an auto-forward mode with it's own settings (for hands-free play) and a Skip button that only works after you've passed a scene once.  Lastly, I'd strongly recommend getting this on sale because of the length and price. Especially because you're gonna want that 18+ patch that you have to buy on top of buying the game. Then you're gonna wanna buy Vol. 2, which also requires you to buy another 18+ patch. Then Vol. 3 and you get where this is going. So ya.   Meow on, cat daddies (and mommies) ^.^
boobs :)
Very nice
I like cats.
I love Cat Girls.
What the fuck have I done with my life ? My parents say I'm a disappointment, and my friends don't talk to me anymore since I've started to play this.
i wonder what it feels like to touch a woman

NICE BOONGALOONBERS BRO
This game is basically just pedophilia masked by cat girls.
Not worth 10 fucking dollars lmfaooo
I am a fan of visual novels so this definitely scratched my itch, the cat girls are adorable and getting to know them a bit for the first 5 chapters before getting down to business was nice. I just spend 6 hours on this game and I am already on Chapter 7 of 8, so it goes by super fast. If you're into cat anime girls and don't mind them being made love to by the protagonist then this is the game for you but of course there is also the PG version available as well which is nice for those that just want story. Not sure what they do to replace the hentai scenes but I am sure it's just as enjoyable.

I fell off man.
Segsy
Was on call with a friend. Can confirmed he skipped through Nekopara without reading it. Based. You cannot even begin to comprehend the hours wasted of your life in order to read a casual visual novel, but here he is skipping a 4/5 hour visual novel. Compare that shit to Fate/Stay Night, Steins Gate, and god forbid, Clannad. 80 fucking hours for one route out of multiples you gotta unlock and he merely skipped one the size of a 2 bit bite sized lunchable snack. Whats worse is that he didnt have the NSFW content so he didnt get the full experience. My disappointment is immeasurable and every time i read a visual novel i will forever be reminded there is scum like him who speed run the entire fucking thing.  My day is ruined.   I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will read visual novels without skipping them. A nation of the truly enlightened, dammit. A nation of BIG BRAIN, not MONKE, ruled by the pen, not the sword! Where the person changes to suit the visual novel, not the other way around. Where time and commitment are back where they belong: in the hands of the visual novels! Where every visual novel is free to read - to be read - without being skipped! Fuck all these limp-dick hentai enthusiast and chickenshit trophy hunters. Fuck this 24-hour Internet spew of cheat guides and hacking bullshit! FUCK ALL OF IT! Modern Visual Novels are diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving them - we need to drag them out by the coding. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new era of visual novels will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The bite-sized visual novels will be purged and the longest bible-sized will thrive - free to make as much revenue as they see fit, they'll make visual novels great again!... In my new visual novel market, people will read and enjoy visual novels for what they BELIEVE! Not for hentai. Not for achievements! Not for what they're told to read. Every man will be free to read of his own choice!  This is the only thing i know for real and is that it has to be this way!  (For all intensive purposes this is a meme, not an attempt to overthrow the economy or start a riot. If it does, i am not to blame. Do recommend the game. Its a classic VN)
im stuck on the first level
great game
it's ok
i love it
Help. my cats are fighting, what do

Bought for the memes, played for the memes, continued to play for the genuinely great story and voice acting.

Piston motion simulator.
My life is an empty shell spent living vicariously through fictional anime boys getting their rocks off to cat girls..........  10/10 dis sum good sheit mayn
Gods love has limits
Good Game
Vanilla best catgirl. 10/10 would "read" again
Vanilla and Chocola best Neko Maids Nyan~ ùwú
pretty pog catgirl waifus ngl
Honestly, the DLC adds a ton of extra content and kinda changes the understanding of the character relationships.  Surprisingly, I think not seeing the DLC is not seeing a meaningful part of everyone's personality and thoughts regarding one another.    Also, catgirls in heat, come on.
Catgirl Paradise 🥰
I blew my load all over my keyboard. I'm sorry.
Dis a good game.
Shane Dawson simulator.            Also, I was gifted this game, so I am exempt from being a degenerate (I think).
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a timeless classic that will live on eons into the future. Without this game, society as a whole would crumble. This game defines how the world works and  who remains in power. NEKOPARA is a game that not only created the world we know, but maybe even the universe itself. The gods created this game for us to enjoy for generations past, now and to come. NEKOPARA has brought us the greatest enjoyment in our lives.........   Now let me add it to the spank bank
10/10 Would be persecuted by PETA again
I like to take care of my cats.
Pls turn into a Catgirl
Don't get any of these games. Don't let your sexual desires take over. Just get some f-u-c-k-i-n-g help.
CROOOOOTTTT
this game caused me to align all of my chakra. 10/10 would fap again
I am sorry mum. BTW I think dad should also check out this game
balls
best game

69/69 Time to go buy a cat
Azuki
pretty ok
yeah i gotta go outside
I bought the whole bundle and the dlcs for the laughs, got depression instead knowing I can't get catgirls in this reality. 7/10 chocola is annoying, vanilla is cool, she has smug vibes
I went in thinking this would be trash. Like the guilty type of trash you scarf down in private. Came out unabashedly liking Vanilla more than I normally do.
this game is absolute garbage, the cats are desiveing you tricking you into likeing them with their stupid Nyaahs and meows to think you would like them, anyone that means 99% of you fi you lke this stupid dumb game then you are a horny, cat loving freak, this game might be as or worse than euphoria. dont play this, you will see cats differently if you play this stupid game. you will go into a state of despair if you play this. this is a warning for Everyone i cant even explain how annoying the stupid cats are. just dont play it
I had a fantastic time playing this game I would recommended.

After seeing all the accolades, I decided to take a chance when this title went on sale....and I now regret it.  First, if you are interested in this title for its erotic content, know ahead of time that this content was completely removed by Steam.  If you desire that content, you need to go to the developer's website and pay $10 for a patch to restore the content.  Second, if you are interested in this title for its storyline, I personally found it dull and tiresome.  Seiously, the story basically goes like this:  Vanilla:  Master, can we have shampoo for our hair? Chocola: You are mean!  We want shampoo for our hair! Narrator:  We did not come to the market to buy shampoo. Vanilla: (whines) But we want shampoo! Chocola:  The shampoo makes our hair nice. Both: PLEASE! Narrator: No, we are here to buy grocieries.  and on.....and on...and on....  This isn't quite verbatim, but it's an accurate reflection.  Third, if you're interested in the anime graphics, they are fine, but I've seen both far better and far worse.  Admittedly, I could invest more hours of my life into this "game" and hope it gets better, but since the beginning failed to grab my attention (the first rule of writing a good book is to seize the reader's attention--because this is really a book, not a game), it doesn't bode well.  I do not recommend it.  EDIT:   I forced myself to finish Nekopara 1.  It does eventually get better, and there are some erotic scenes, but you have to grind through a lot of annoying dialogue to get there.  I'm currently playing Nekopara 2 which gets to the action more quickly.  There's enough dialogue to develop the characters without it getting annoying.  I think that the developers learned from the first one and made the second one better.
Really good, I wish I had a Vanilla.
Catgirl and maid ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A game for true cowboys! Thanks to her, I honed the "ALT+TAB" skill to the maximum and got the achievement "The fastest hand in the Wild West". The graphics, animation and sound are at the highest level, this masterpiece is worth its money. Stock up on baby hand cream, paper napkins and go ahead to explore the paradise islands of pleasure)

I was recommended this by a friend who loves the Nekopara series. And while the story is cute and the lewd scenes are interesting this isn't something I'd recommend if you like visual novels that give you choices and have branching paths. Because it doesn't have any. Which to me is one of my favorite things about visual novels. Now if you're fine with a linear story with cute cat girls and some smut then by all means give it a go.
This game is only for horny people and people who want to hold space for few hours. With no gameplay. 10/10 best game
I never thought that I'd like anime cat girls, still, funny game 10/10 thanks japan
Where did I go wrong in life to end up here

Cute. Downloaded the patch, disappointed my parents and I have no regrets.  9/10
I'm so glad my dad's condom broke so I could enjoy this game.
Now this is pod racing
Pretty cool
I feel like I'm committing a crime just by owning this game
I didn't fuck Vanilla, i didn't cum on Vanilla. I didn't put my dick anywhere near Vanilla. I've done anything weird with Vanilla. I promised myself i wasn't going to make an apology after 4 hours of playtime so i'm just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible. (1/?)
i swear i only got this game for the emojis and stuff. i dont play these kinda games.
I don't know why, as a refined man of culture, I didn't get this sooner. They're nekos, what else do you want?
daddy elon really fulfilled his end of the promise
Excellent project with great soundtrack, really adorable and complex characters, and amazing graphics. With bounciness. *wink* Nya~!
vry cute
meow -cat
I wish catgirls were real.
nice  (I would've gave this a great but Shigure and her brother complex made me physically cringe.)
10 / 10
Beautiful Game... Great visual novel... wonderful content...
Disliked the writing and story of this game.
Y'know, I got this purely because I thought it was honestly going to be a meme game with hentai. (BONUS!)   Nekopara is actually pretty wholesome... in a weird fucked up way. I streamed this game to my friends to get a bunch of haha's and make fun of sex scene moments but instead, we ended up discussing the legality of catgirl rights and how it works. Like do stray catgirls get euthanised if they don't have a bell or don't get adopted? Does the catgirl industry parallel with slavery as we purchase them for personal reasons? Who made the catgirls? Is there a fine line between a catgirl pet or a catgirl partner? The game implies a connection between catgirls and crime activity, do they just steal cat food or is there an organised catgirl crime syndicate thing going on?  Such questions might never be answered...
make me coom
i am a disgrace upon my people
Fascinating!
good for the hentai even better for the speedrun. 10/10
im degen af
i love cinnamon she makes me cum in a hearbeat. i cant wait for my nekopara figures to come in the mail so i can ejaculate all over them.
Beyond perfection.
Forgive me god

All you need to know is: catgirls
Ah yes money well spent
[h1]Introduction[/h1] [b]Nekopara[/b] is a kinetic visual novel developed by [b]NEKO WORKs[/b] and published by [b]Sekai Project[/b]. There has been a lot of hype about this series since its release in 2014 and I have finally decided to give it a chance to see how it lives up to all the praise. There are a total of four volumes and a prequel in this series so I have chosen to start with the first game that was released, volume 1.  [h1]Story[/h1] [b]Kashou Minazuki[/b] is the son of a long line of Japanese confection makers. One day, he decides to move out and start his own bakery called [b]La Soleil[/b]. When he arrives at his new location, two large boxes appear and upon opening them, he found two catgirls named [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] packed inside. Originally, they were at [b]Kashou’s[/b] old home and owned by his younger sister [b]Shigure Minaduki[/b]. The two catgirls feel that [b]Kashou[/b] is their true owner and followed him to his new location. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208026  [b]Kashou[/b] tried to send them back but they begged and pleaded until he eventually gave in to their pleas. The two catgirls at hand, who really love their master, will try their best to help run the bakery and will do their very best with varying results.  [h1]Pros and Cons[/h1] [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*]A cute kinetic VN with cute catgirls [*]Interesting characters that show development throughout the story [*]Beautiful art style that is very pleasing to look at [/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*]The story is very bland and lacks excitement [*]I do have some issues with the characters [*]Some people may be turned off by some of the sexual storyline aspects [/list]  [h1]Characters[/h1] Every catgirl you meet is cute and has a different personality. They learn and grow in the world around them. [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] particularly are new to the outside world so their interactions tend to be very childlike at first. There are a group of characters that you will meet but this volume focuses on [b]Chocola[/b] and [b]Vanilla[/b] so I’ll be covering those two respectively. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208475 You follow in the footsteps of [b]Kashou[/b] and we are in his perspective throughout the story. He is easygoing and is willing to lend a hand whenever he can, however, at times he can be a bit dense. Sometimes he is incapable of getting hints and has to be told directly what's on someone's mind.  [b]Chocola[/b] is cheerful, has a dog-like personality, and is very fond of her master [b]Kashou[/b] so much that she wants his attention. At the same time, she is energetic, friendly, and well-loved by those around her. [b]Chocola[/b] has a hard time doing difficult tasks and tends to leap into action without thinking of the consequences.  [b]Vanilla[/b] is the twin sister of [b]Chocola[/b] and is the exact opposite in terms of personality as she is quiet and calm. She can be smart but does prefer to do things on her own, however, she does remain kind-hearted and well-liked.  Out of the two, [b]Vanilla[/b] is my personal favorite due to her quiet nature and I would personally like to hang around her more than her hyper sister.  [h1]Problems with the story[/h1] The story is good but unfortunately, it falls short in many areas that prevent it from being anything more than average. There are no events that would serve to add excitement to the story instead I found myself more just waiting for the spicy scenes to happen as the primary focus. We do get to see [b]Kashou’s[/b] bakery gain gradual success, but it is not much else there.  Next, I have issues with two characters. Now I should point out that I do not hate these two in any shape or form but I still have problems with them.   [b]Chocola[/b] is the first character that I found issues with. While I didn't hate her character, I found her to be a big attention magnet in general. This is subjective of course, but I did not like how more attention was put on her compared to her twin sister [b]Vanilla[/b]. I understand that [b]Vanilla[/b] is meant to be the quiet one, but characters like that typically get their very own big moment and story segment. Unfortunately, this never happens so she becomes more of a background character being completely taken over by [b]Chocola[/b]. I feel some more time would have been nice on the other cat girl, especially when they did such a good job making her equally as interesting.  Then, there is [b]Kashou[/b], he falls flat in terms of character development. He does not really do much outside his focus on the bakery. There was a moment where he did talk about leaving his family due to some issues, however, this was not touched upon further in the story. I don’t know if this is tackled in the other volumes but it’s left untouched in this volume leaving us with a boring main protagonist.  The final issue I have is that some of the sexual story elements may be a turnoff for some people. If you are looking for a cute kind of VN, then [b]Nekopara[/b] does offer that, however, it will be drowned out with the spicy scenes later on.  [h1]Artstyle, Performance, and Soundtrack[/h1] The art style is something that I was really impressed with. There are some really beautiful scenes that you will be able to see throughout the game and each is very detailed. [b]Nekopara[/b] should run fine on any computer due to this being mostly pictures, music, and text. I came across no issues while I was playing. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, with16 GB of RAM.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2549208605 The soundtrack is an area that could have been shown some more love. There were no tracks that were bad or distracting, but also none that stood out or were memorable. The music choices simply fit the requirement of having background music while you play through the story.  There is an 18+ patch that is available for 11.49 CDN through Steam. This adds adult content that further shows how the relationship between Kashou and the girls develops. The patch includes three segments of H-scenes that are animated and fully voiced that are very well done. Personally I believe these scenes help complete the experience and should absolutely be picked up if you enjoy adult content in visual novels.   I also recommend going into the options settings and maxing out the chest jiggle physics. After that, press the "P" button on your keyboard during the regular dialogue scenes as you are in for a cute treat. This function will work with or without the patch.  [h1]Final Verdict[/h1] If you like are looking to play a visual novel with cute catgirls, then [b]Nekopara[/b] will most definitely meet your needs in this area. It has a nice charm with standout art in both the character and background scenes. As this is a kinetic visual novel, there aren't any dialogue choices that will change the routes or endings of the game, so be sure to temper your expectations as you are getting more of a story with cute cat girls more than something that will feel like a game.  I recommend [b]Nekopara[/b] to anyone who loves catgirls as I felt that even looking at the shortcomings developer [b]NEKO WORKs[/b] absolutely knows how to do catgirls. ;3  I also recommend getting the 18+ patch, you get the full experience of the story, and don’t forget to max the chest jiggle.

catgirls
i was given both volume 1 and 2 as a birthday present from a friend a few years ago  i will never forget it in the slightest
I once again have nothing but positive words to say about this game. following Vol.0 it has continued to be a beacon for my healing mental state, every day for months I would feel extreme emotion about going home and being able to take care of my kittens. it was a constant cycle of anxiety whenever I left my house. I didn't want my kittens to think I didn't care for them but they seemed to understand that I needed to work and would wait patiently for me to get back home. After some time though I couldn't take the anxiety and stress that was leaving my silly little bakas at home. I couldn't go a millisecond of my day without thinking about them. It got to the point where I was hearing their voices behind the counter of GameStop asking me to pet them. I couldn't hear my own thoughts and my ability to communicate with other people began to diminish. it got to the point where I couldn't even talk to people anymore. the second I stepped out of my home I heard Chocola and Vanilla begging me to come back to them. I couldn't take it. I knew that they were ok with me leaving for work but I wasn't. So good news!!! I quit!!! my anxiety and stress calmed after I was able to come back to my kittens and stay with them for my entire day. I decided to learn how to code in python, java, and c++ so I could supply for myself and my kittens from home. it was really stressful cramming 3 whole coding languages into my brain before the money my parents left me ran dry but I barely managed to make it finally landing a coding job after running out of money and eating nothing but dry cup noodles since my water was cut. Life has never been better for me though. constant feelings of joy while my catgirls are happy. My new job supplies more money than my old one and I just couldn't ask for a better situation. this game has completely revolutionized my life, making me a new person. my love for this game will never hit a limit as it is infinite. My love is ever-expanding like the universe. I genuinely cannot recommend this game more. It picked me up and put, me on my feet. it supported me through not only one mentally ill phase but two. And hey even though the second one was triggered by the game it is self it was never to hurt me. I've never been healthier and happier. this game has brought me to new highs and even though it brought me close to a low it was only for my own good as afterwords I'm better than ever. please throw your money at this game, you won't regret it.
i guess i'll never see the light of day and a girlfriend afterall.
I fucking love cat girls.

Sweet Vanilla  Both the genre and the catgirl.  Great art, cuteness, and h-scenes.
why did someone gift this to me
Good
My wife left me
i almost died from playing this game, it's good.
This fucking sucks. I bought this game thinking it would be a cute game about catgirls and cooking. And it was at first! Up until Chocola goes into heat and her owner has sex her. I couldn't believe this. And her sister joined in?! And no, I didn't buy the mature patch. After buying the game, I heard tell of it containing questionable content. I figured I'd be able to play the game without the mature patch and be able to enjoy it as a cute game about catgirls! But no. Adult patch or not, it's very painfully obvious what is happening and what happens afterwards. I was extremely disgusted, as it was very clear that Chocola and Vanilla (SISTERS!) had intercourse with each other as well as their master, who viewed them as his kids. And the fact he stood over them and was like "i viewed them as a my daughters and my lovers" THAT IS SO INSANELY SICKENING AND CONCERNING. I skipped through the rest of the game, avoiding all dialogue and honestly avoiding the screen altogether. I just wanted to get my achievements and card drops and leave since I went past the hour limit already and couldn't refund. This sucked. This sucked. Anyone who enjoys this game, specifically the adult content, needs investigated.
no nude nekos
I feel likie this game nius vbery racist since it only xdshows asian girls.
i wish i had the nsfw dlc
Maafkan hamba yang berdosa ini.
my gf left me because of this game... i love it! 10/10

Proud to have this in my library.
catgirls with poggers pussys
Good game
cute :3
we all know why your here, pervert. 7/10  highly recommend
Best Game Ever.
Bought the whole series while it was on sale.  Just from the first volume and more than half of the second I would say it is a good purchase.
all right i did not like this game before but i gave it other chance it still makes me umcomterble tho
I don't think words can describe how good this truly is. While it doesn't have any "game" to it, as its a visual novel type, it still does its job well on how good it makes itself.  Oh, and I also highly recommend the 18+ DLC too, just... its worth it. Trust me.
is gud
i hate this
I'm having fun, but I might need to play a bit more to really see if it's worth buying.
Good god, what the fuck did my life come to
cute game with cute cat girls, cured my depression and brought my grandpa back from the dead
I like catgirls, sue me.
BEST GAME :) love the dlc^^
10/10 Masterpiece
BOOBA
yes this is good
Slow to start, but it gets better as you progress through the chapters. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a game to interact with then you're better off purchasing any of the other Nekopara games in the series as this one functions more as an animated visual novel.   Again, there is an 18+ adult content DLC if that interests you.   The music is a little repetitive and there are large gaps in which there is no audio outside of the background music since Kashou has no spoken lines. There is also a large amount of time in which the story focuses on the same image. I adjusted my settings to allow for the auto play feature to be active so it may be better to leave the text speed alone and navigate yourself if you don't want such lengthy scenes.   All in all, it's a sweet story and I did enjoy it. Even if it was a tad dry in places.
Damn cute catgirls
I highly recommend. The novel has a great way of conveying emotions and romance. I honestly have an understanding for the world and the characters. 10/10 good read.
NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA NYA  It has a catgirl harem... I don't think I need to say anything more

I watched the anime, I liked it, so I bought the game  Throughout the game you will see funny and entertaining neko girls
Didn't get the story with all that Catpanion porn interrupting every time. Catpanion porn was good so no problem.   +18 FREE patch is necessary to take the most out of this VN.  [h1] 7/10 [/h1]
Played it for the plot
catigrl
yes
It's Nekopara. You know what you're getting in to with this one.  If you like catgirls, buy it. If you don't, skip out on this one.  Oh, and don't forget to get the 18+ patch.
>:)
This is epic, ^w^
I wish i had a life
It´s one of the best games I have played this year 10 out of 10.
pepega neko
much cool much wow.    dead by daylight hour must not exceed NEKOPARA Vol.1 hours
only realised that my 7yo cousin uses my account sometimes for games until after i bought this.
Tried to start a pastry store. Couldn't get any work done because my cats kept pressuring me to sleep with them. 9/10.
Awesome VN, I quickly fell in love with the characters. Lewdness is just a bonus... a good one.
My heart and soul can't take it anymore!  Ok so it all started when i discovered this cute little anime called Nekopara. I watched a couple of episodes which i really enjoyed, the cute vibes from it honestly warmed my heart and soul.  The next day(which is today) i watch a couple more episodes, and what can i say im really loving the whole cat girl concept they have. I really loved it for being such a cute, family friendly, and innocent show. After a couple episodes i call it a day, leave some episodes for other days.  As i was about to leave my browser i suddenly remember hearing that nekopara the anime originally came from it's game. Out of curiosity i searched it up. It said Nekopara is "from an adult visual novel", and that the game was 18+. I thought to myself "what's so 18+ about cat girls serving people in a restaurant"(i only assumed that this was what the game was about). Out of disbelief i searched "is nekopara 18+?". Google answered yes, "what really?" i thought to myself, so i decided to click images... And what i saw would continue to haunt me for the rest of my days. Immediately after seeing the dozens and dozens of nsfw nekopara images, my heart sunk, and my soul commited suicide, and shock froze my body still. I was very depressed(and still am) to find out that the cute and happy anime that i so enjoyed came from a fucking hentai game.  I am very sad, angry, and depressed right now. Im not sure how im supposed to cope with this sudden and shocking revelation, but thank you for listening till the end of my rant and goodbye, i shall cry in a corner for a solid hour now.
Thank you Ran for this birthday gift, i shall never play this game
Yes
my brother forced me to play
cats dont look like that 0.0
[h1]I played Nekopara for the plot I swear[/h1] [i]That's half the reason at least[/i]  [b]The Plot[/b]  The plot of Nekopara is actually really well written, for a game that seems like its dedicated to be lewd, it's actually quite wholesome. You, Kashou is a man who has just moved and got a new bakery. But, from his past, the neko's catgirls he once looked down to as little daughters have shown up, and are looking to stay for long term. Of course, this isn't smooth sailing, but Kashou agrees and the catgirls are now workers at the store. A long the rest of the game, they do many different kind of activities like walk around, and "stuff". The last chapters of the story are a lot more loved-related, and is pretty cheesy. But, it works pretty well. I give the plot a [b]9/10[/b]  [b]THE MUSIC YOOOOOOOOOOOO[/b]  THE MUSIC IN NEKOPARA IS FIRE!!! There is literally a song that sounds like an altered version of "Sweden" by c418. Then, there is the slow melodies, the ones that are like, wow, this is wholesome. Then there is the PepeJAM songs. If the plot doesn't work, but listen to the soundtrack. I give the music a [b] 10/10 [/b]  [b]The nsfw content [/b]  How do I describe the nsfw content. I'd say that it is so good, that it feels wrong. I don't want to get into the details, but if you want an hour long session, Nekopara literally provides. But, it is very wholesome, and it seems like the catgirls actually enjoy it. I give the nsfw content a 9/10  [b]Summary[/b]  You will either be into nekopara, or really into nekopara. There isn't a choice. This game has a little something for everyone -IGN. Also, you can find the visual novels online, but please support the creator by buying these games.
Am i considered a furry if i enjoyed it
i was force to play this and i will never get back 47 mins of my life back
This is a masterpiece, games cannot get batter than this beauty.  I cannot believe how much fun i got from this game.9/10 this game sucked ass and im not a nonce

My only and best friend got me this furry game. No i have 0 friends again
12 minute playing many achievement and hapiness. Vanilla and chocola hella cute tho.
anime
cool game
I don't know why I bought this.  I don't even like visual novels, or simping over catgirls.  Because that's all there is to this ''game''.
The game that started my problem with nekogirls, do I regret it? Absolutly not! Nyaaa~~
Catgirl
booba
it's cute.
You know what this game is, I know what this game is, and I also know why you're here.   So to answer your question as to if you should buy it, yes, yes you should.
cat
And still those are calling from far away
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
So i got the game because i loved the anime. I knew the game had some lewd scenes but jeez this was just straight up hentai.
actually pretty good from when I played it would play again 10/10
I hope when my cat became cat girl (LOL)
send help
LOVE
The best purchase i ever made for a game, wished it kept going but I'll definitely buy all the other games for sure.
Good game

come to the dark side and be a degenerate (✿●▽●)=ε/̵͇̿̿/̿ ̿ ̿(✿._.)
Total ass with cringeworthy dialogue
Great game to play with only one hand. It on my p*nis of course (auto is a feature for a reason), and my other hand was all the way up inside my dog trying to find that goddamn microphone Obama put inside him to spy on me and turn me into a lizard person with only one testicle, found it tho.  Nine out of eleven, came 3 times. [spoiler] (_)_):::::::::D~~~~ this is coom tho~~~ [/spoiler]
even 100nyan power can't make me finish this game
NUT
:)
vanilla best girl
BAD GAME NOT UNCENSORED!!!!!!!!
Lewd but wholesum. Whole-lewd, lewd-sum, It's Both lewd and Wholesum.
My friend and I bought this for giggles and grins. You already know we played this together. But the first 10 minutes of us starting, I heard a loud *POP* and my LED lights began flashing different colors, I unplugged them but they were still flashing for a few seconds before finally stopping. Not only this, but my friends fan turned on without him turning it on.  I think it's safe to say that God was warning us, telling us to turn back. He wanted us to stop. But we kept going.  I've been stuck in this game for 272 hours. I can't escape the catgirls.
Small boobies yes
Poggers
I want to fuck my cat now

Nekopara Volume 1 is the first entry in the massively successful Nekopara franchise. It takes place somewhere in Japan, where a budding MC(Main Character) sets off to establish their own bakery, separate from the harsh family life they once had. Strange things ensue once he finds some of his family's catgirls hiding along with the rest of his belongings, and they quickly form a special bond. And yes, that includes sex. Raw, vigorous sex. You know what you're playing. Nekopara Volume 1 is my favorite entry in the massively successful Nekopara franchise.
Yeah, you can guess at what time my mom came into my room:)- 10/10
Yes this game its perfect
Awful waste of time. I bought it as a lark, but I was still shocked by how terrible this was. The story is awful: played through half of this game's chapters, and literally nothing has happened. One of the only two pieces of conflict in the first half of this boring snooze-fest was the Catgirl Certificate Exam thing, and it gets resolved off-screen 20 minutes after it's introduced.  The other conflict was about how the stupid MC didn't want to have two eager to help cute mascot girls hanging around his newly cafe. Bro, isn't it obvious that they'd benefit your business immensely? So, to recap: the only two things that actually happen in the fist half this story: one of them happens only because the MC is incredibly stupid, and the other is resolved immediately. The soundtrack is sappy garbage, the character designs are OK at best, the story is almost non existent, the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Absolutely worthless.
highly recommend, never cummed so hard, biggest erection ever
I have brought shame to my family
i have not felt a touch of a woman in 3 years
Catgirl. Yes.
virginity is cool, remain pure.
Pros: * cute * so wholesome omg * anime boobies * good music * good art * good writing * gallery  Cons: * you can't replay the wholesome scenes unless you save them in seperate slots
I know the joke is to review this well because of how degenerate the concept is but to be fully honest there are some parts of the story that could unfold into interesting and engaging plot points.  But the writers never notice that and squander their chances to tell that.  An example being the "bells", basically a dog tag that shows that a cat girl is trained: I find it interesting that the choc and vanilla are so proud of being owned, seeing the bell as a sort of mark of maturity, but the story never goes into simple things like whats the fail rate of catgirls that take the test or why there is even bells in the first place, instead it uses it for some cheap gags and a little tension.  TLDR; choc and vanilla have no personality, have the same bland hair cut and have sex with the mc right in the middle of the story, leaving the rest of the plot after that to flounder trying to find interesting things to do besides showing off the two main girls being mentally retarded for cuteness, you also have to pay for the sex scenes.
Catgirls are cool
catgirl sex
why are we here.  just to suffer ?
Cute, playful, heartwarming, and spicy catgirl fun!
I am wanted across the globe for beastiality

It would demean Nekopara to refer to it as a "game". Clearly this is an art piece has revolutionised culture to new heights.
cat girl cute
Welp, the feds caught me guys. I told them I didn't know these girls were only 9 month old but they didn't care. See you in 15 years
hentai scenes were removed :((
This is NOT a game. It's a pure kinetic novel with Zero player input at any time. Worse, by the game's own math, the two characters that you first get up to hentai events with are only 15, making this game a violation of both Steam policy AND national/international pedophilia laws. I have NO idea how this has even remained legally for sale, let alone apparently become popular... (For clarity, the game claims a 7-month-old catgirl is the equivalent of a 12-year-old. And that the two characters in question are only 9 months old. That's 1.714 years age equivalence per month, so 9  X 1.714 = 15.43 years of age for the main two girls. Of course, it also claims they are genetically modified CATS, not humans/aliens/magical whatisits with cat features, which also makes this a case of borderline bestiality as well...)
Catgirls 10/10
I Love The Nekopara Series :) ~I Just Watched From Lost Pause and Now I'm Actually Playing IT!  Damn... The DLC though added a LOT of SCENARIOS :3 ~DAMN
There is fresh air outside. Please take a breather.
My family struggled for food, we lived in Iraq at the time. I had no motivation, I was depressed, lonely, and barely managed to get out of bed each day. One day I finally brought myself to go on discord for the first time in a year and had a single dm from my only friend. All it said was "nekopara." I took a sip of my final glass of water (the water hole ran out) and downloaded it, it took 40 hours (best internet in the area). Immediately after mere seconds of opening it, I finally felt encouraged to do something. I applied for every job in my area and managed to secure 47 out of 10 of them, I worked all day long week after week, and finally managed to leave Iraq (without my family) and now I spend my days playing nekopara. I wish to do nothing else with my life. I am in love with Nekopara.
i love to practice polygamy with my catgirls
nice
this is as close as i'm going to get to having relationship with someone.
This game made me realize i should take my schizo medication
I got this game for the cute catgirls and I've always enjoyed a nice visual novel. But I didn't check through all the tags and reviews and MISSED THE HENTAI TAG!! I really really wish I saw it first because the girls all look super young and I had to fast click through the lewd scenes because.....ew. It's super cute and fun otherwise, that's the only thing that made me regret buying it lol.
Cute Storyline had me cracking up more than once. nice time waster.
Very cute visual novel! 10/10 Now I want my own neko patisserie. Puru puru ~~
Wholesome :3
Game is kinda OK.
year is 2020 -covid hit -realized i'm not going to see my few friends in over a year -school is almost over; grades are ass and almost failed all my classes -grandfather dies -can't go out because covid and riots -completely hopeless --buy game --enjoy entire series --maybe things will improve  year is 2021 -grades are higher than ever -applying for college -i have the will to wake up in the morning  Can't wait to tell my future grand-children how catgirls and vtubers changed my life.  10/10 game. "restored my hope for the world"
i'm allergic to cats why am i even playing this game?  oh yeah because this is the only way i can pet them ;-;
this is a true masterclass in gaming, i rate this game an 11.4/10, for all audiences best game ever this title truly made me satisfied with my life, it surpasses the idea of perfection by at least 254%. this game is a must buy.
Didn't realise this game was so sexual when I got it, not sure what to think  but damn im gonna cosplay chocola now fucking adorable
katze is de best
Kitties and a baker nothing unusual here
Story is cute and chill for real, but we all know the reason you're here.  Also I'm ok with my life choices.

I have only one game with a perfect achievement record.   Only one game in all the millions available on this godforsaken platform.   And here it is, degeneracy incarnate.   It literally plays itself, but you should check to see if company is coming over before you let it run. Let me tell you, there's nothing you can do or say to save a dinner party after your guests stumble upon Chocola and Vanilla doing their thing.
i have no regrets. I mean, what can I say, this game changed my life.
nice
This is quite literally the post what if scenario for elon musk mass producing catgirls from a rich westaboo japanese persons pov.
Jiggle Jiggle
10/10, cutest sci-fi dystopia i ever saw.
Life changing.
The best visual novel experience I've ever had. There is nothing like a moment with cute cat girls to help take your mind off the struggles, stress, issues, and pressure from real life. I love the whole story and all the characters. I highly recommend this game and all the volumes after this to anyone who may be interested.
I hate all of these games
Yup.
Played this game with my friends as a joke and now we can't stop playing   this game is shit but thats what makes it great 10/10
catgirls r hot, 11/10
What the hell Edit: maybe a little good edit 2: oh edit 3: i finished and
overrated as hell but the game is pretty nice.  WARNING: don't buy it if u wanna just fap, it gets forever to get some nudity of it.

This VN game is as good as they say. Too bad the girls in this volume is not my cup tea. With an expected tearjerker of a backstory I say you can either play this with or without the adult patch.  Visuals, voice acting, story... 7 out of 10 for this volume since like I said earlier, the available girls are not to my personal liking (size wise).  Also, the most common flaw in these VN games is the pacing which made me struggle to stay awake since when things get slow, it REALLY gets slow. Skipping it sometimes made me miss bits of the story details and it didn't feel right so I had to play this when I had extra time to spare.
Yes Dad, I am winning

Great to play with family and friends <3

i deleted "pRiCeLEss FaMIlY pHoTOs" (their words, not mine) to download this game, meh, no one looks back at old photos anyways
Its pretty simple to know if you'll like the game. Do you like cat girls? Do you like moe? If you answered yes to both of these then its for you
11/10 masterpiece
they are 9 months old.

Shane dawson's fav game
Hey quick question, how do you hide products from friends. Asking for a friend :)
this game taught me how to alt-tab quicker
Good
hot neko girls yes
I went from playing FPS, Rhythm Games, JRPGS, to a hentai visual novel with fucking catgirls and I somehow got emotional over it idk why but I wanna kms  10/10 would do again  Vanilla and Chocola is hot when they call me master omfg keep calling me it
this is definitely a good game, can recommend, LOTS of plot
i like men
Yeah I uh, I play for the plot
I can hear PETA knocking at my door.
yes
very very good MEOW
Don't be fooled by those sh!tty tags, its safe to play trust me, do you? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What  I find some Achievement Bug Play as Japanese, I achieved Chinese  Play as English, I achieve Japanese Play as Chinese, I achieve...... You know what I say I recommend this game because of catgril. I will write the review later
you know why you're buying this
TIL: - You can have human-cat sex. - Human-cats get their periods. - I should read game descriptions.  Fun game, just close the door and don't tell anyone what you're doing.
When i download an uncensored patch i expect full unceonsored period. one of this mosaic bullshit.
wangy wangy_
Imagine buying a game because you think "wow look, wholesome cat girls!" and see good art and think "wow, with that quality of art, and clearly two visible characters, they very clearly had the budget to include some pretty intricate routes!"  HAHA NOPE. The story is pretty half ass aside from worldbuilding, there are no routes or decisions to be seen and you end up just dating both of them AT ONCE, and there are some pretty poorly written excuses to include sex scenes for the coomers to tug their dicks to. I walked in expecting a sweet, classy dating sim with 2 routes, and I was handed, in essence, a random porno with the sex cut out... and you have to click a lot. Even if you like porn, like, damn, idk, go on pornhub or whatever you do, don't waste your time here. This game is overhyped to hell and back. The biggest draw of this game is the aesthetic, and shit, just like, look at the pictures, lie that you played it, and you'll have had the best nekopara experience of anyone here.
dude I like filled myself up like 20 times this is such a great game make sure to get the dlc 18+ as well full volume in class would reccomend
It's actually a really fun game with a fun story to just play, when you're bored for example. I encourage you to buy this.
i will never feel the touch of a lover edit: full completion
I'm going to jail.
sexc!
plot's meh but sex is cool
:)
This is a game only for red blooded males. It involves various breasts, excellent physics, and annoying cat girls.

Boring story, stereotypical  stupid characters, just your typical low tier hentai porn game with glitter sprinkled on it. Physically painful to get through and I'm only 3 hours in at the time of writing this and that was just the pointless drawn out intro, I don't think it's worth buying just for "leh lolz and memez".  Wouldn't even be THAT bad if it didn't have inclusion of paedophilia, incest and bestiality. I just think If you like this unironically you're a disturbed individual. I would say I'm surprised at how THIS has overwhelmingly good reviews, but there's always a market for degenerates. Anti vaxxers and flat earthers are starting to look intelligent now.
Meat status: Beated 7 times
Forgive me father I have sinned
yes
Thanks TsundereKanojo for giving me this game good game thanks :) best gift ever
An excellent game, I heard about this game from friends, and it certainly was worth what I paid for it, with a story that keeps you interested, and some Catgirls that have no right to be as cute as they are, this is well worth it. One bad thing, however, is that the Devs charge more for the NSFW DLC than the actual game itself, and you only get an uncensored bath scene, and 3 sex scenes. The NSFW DLC is only really worth it if you wait for a sale. Apart from that one thing, excellent game, I think I'm going to play the rest of the series, too.
😳
YES.
Vanilla said I'm cool :)
You can pretend you're having s*x with 2 funny cat woman.
AMAZING STORY. Both the beginning and end had me in tears. and made me realise that i will be alone for my entire life.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
now i know what it's like to be loved
All the neko girls are so super cute! And if you get the 18+ dlc theyre also very... attractive so to say hehe.
Very interesting game, can't make decisions, but that doesn't take away from the morals you can learn from it! Game had very good teachings about a lot of issues modern people may struggle with.
cool
This game saved my life.  I am 41.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you
A little birdie made me do it.

needs more neko
To be completly honest I did not know what to expect from this. Yet I were actally enjoying this product. While I can say that this may not be good product for many people there will be a group which will enjoy it. Definetly would recomend to virtual novel fans.  Plus for nekos~

YES!!!  ...  ...but only if you are a [gender-pronoun] of culture.
This was awful. If you are making a hentai game that already costs money and for you to be 18+, why make the actual porn part you buy it for DLC? If you ask me this is incredibly stupid and false advertisement. In the tags it clearly says HENTAI. The one time we see them nude isnt even that hot because steam is covering up the nipples and their legs are close together. They make you go through so much dialogue with no reward. It blue-balled me. It cucked me. it was upsetting and disappointing. Im genuinely upset and felt scammed. I have asked for my money back but who knows if i can get it. This game was a terrible lie.
Good shit.
42.. there is just something about that number.. its not about the universe or life tho we all know its about catgirls ;)
shit was fye
god tier game 100/10
Cons: - My dad doesn't talk to me anymore - My friends think I am an utter degenerate - My mum kicked me out the house - I have lost my dignity  Pros: - The catgirls are kinda cute    But in all seriousness: Nekopara is rather well made for a visual novel. Characters eyes and mouths are animated, there are a variety of different sprites and heads as well as tails and ears are responsive. Also there is a Chest Bounciness slider. Probably one of the better Visual Novels out there from a technical standpoint. And besides that it is a massive meme, a cult classic. Nekopara is legendary for a reason.  To everyone who doesn't need repsect from those around them and is willing to sacrifice their dignity:  Give this game a shot
very wholesome game, absolutely nothing unholy included, %100 family friendly, would recommend
A good start to a great adventure
better play this at midnight or 3 am
I have to  say I came for the lewds but I stayed for the emotions
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I cant look directly at my neko already 030
you can open both language as subtitle! best way to study japanese language!
I swear I didnt buy it!!!
Nice steam backgrounds and achivments icons for ur steam profile Will make u regain ur virginity Hold down space to speedrun in 4 minutes
i love it
hentai
Please note! This is a visual novel!!! It's not close to the actual anime since its very lewd and NSFW, but I actually really enjoyed it. The small hints of incest are a tad weird but besides that it was good! Deff recommend!
I hope none of my friends see me playing this...    Great game tho
fun
Pretty fire
All the nekos are beyond cute. If you like cute things, you'll like this.
what else do you need in life
this game is so effing based.
Step 1: Get drunk with friends  Step 2: Turn off dialog volume  Step 3: Do the voice acting yourself  Step 4: Split your sides
I love catgirls
It's Nekopara ... so what else do you expect than loving it ?
vanilla
[b][i]cute[/i][/b]
Rawr! It's been a while since a game has had me blushing this much. Gosh! I had a lot of fun with this title, even if I am about 7 years late to the party. :P   Pros:  - Adorable nekos that you can f*ck. - Great soundtrack. - Adorable nekos that you can f*ck! - Decent artwork. - Did I mention that you can f*ck adorable nekos? - Fun gallery with 'videos' of the action.  Cons:  - The 'AO' content DLC is still mosaic'd/partially censored.  - Feels a little short.  I'd purchase the bundle on sale if you're into nekos/catgirls. It's not the raciest game I've played, but it did leave me feeling a little squirmy and light-headed. Rawr! ;)
i hate myself  cool game tho
This is the moment my life went downhill.
if u buy the 18+ content dlc then it do be great
catgirls
This game give me nostalgic vibes i love it
Cat
(R18 DLC Enabled) The story is very wholesome! Even the feels...(cries) I love it! Having the R18 DLC made it so much better. I play with the volume on MAX! I was put in a daze hearing Vanilla & Chocola moans... I had the biggest nut, and just going off for hours on each scene. The hentai animations are so hot.
I really like Nekopara games and they are so cuteee(≧◡≦) ♡    however there was a bug if anyone else experienced idk but, even though i played the game in english I couldnt get the achievement.
i hHATE THIS GAME! ANIME GIRLS>?????c WHY!
ne naxui
Do yourself a favour and play Volume 1 of Nekopara.  This is the very first game of the series and it really helped set the standard of the future titles. Visual novels are usually dependant on their style, and Volume 1 absolutely nailed it.  One thing that immediately jumps out at you is the music. It. Is. Amazing. Visual novel music just has that certain feel to it, and this game is a perfect representation of that. It's like playing Doki Doki Literature Club for the first time and taking a minute to appreciate the music. It's just so warm and nice, and fits the style of the game so well for some reason. It also has emotional pieces in the game, and those emotional songs are really tender and tug at your heart strings. The music is awesome, and I wish I could see more people appreciating it.  The artwork in this game is also something that immediately jumps out at you. It's just so well made. You can really tell that NekoWorks went all out with how they wanted this game to look. The thing is, the artwork and character sprites are used in future volumes, but you don't get tired of seeing it. I think that this series' artwork is some of the best I've seen, and it's in a visual novel alone. Really amazing stuff.  The voice acting is super good, and very cute. The characters are really sweet and the VAs did such a good job at playing their roles. That's really all I can say, it's just superb.  I have to admit, I saw this game pop into my recommended feed, and it looked interesting, so I made a mental note of it in my head. At the time, all I saw were cute catgirls and thought "I wonder if this will be some strange dating sim", but it turned out to be a really sweet game with a neat story! It's not choice based at all, meaning that you don't have to worry about making any game changing decisions at any point.  At face value, the game is a silly story about a man making love to catgirls, but honestly? Getting to know Chocola and Vanilla and seeing their relationship with the protagonist (Kashou) develop is one of the sweetest things I've seen. This game made me feel emotionally attached and invested in not a lot of time at all, and honestly, I'm happy that I stumbled across it one day.  I will admit, I've well known for instantly getting attached to something assuming it meets everything I'm looking for, and this game was no exception in the slightest. But, I genuinely believe that anyone could get into this game, assuming you don't mind the anime-esque tropes and the whole theme of catgirls, because it's not for everyone obviously.  All in all, Nekopara Volume 1 gets an 11/10 from me. This game helped shape a wonderful concept into the series it is today, and gave me something to pour my passion into. I felt very inspired by this game and it allowed my creativity to get fired up. It's got an overwhelmingly positive response for a reason, and I think that this is a lovely little game that people should consider playing.  Nya~
sorry mom and dad
One day a horny scientist saw a cat... and an Anime girl, and so he put them together. The US hides all anime girls that were brought to our dimension at AREA 5.1, where they are held captive :( I will save them... one day.... Oh btw the game is great, get it, I got  it on sale for great price. The game has a fun story, in general is a great, well rounded hentai game :3 Nekos/catgirls, anime, hentai, it is all here... don't worry what ppl think, whether it be ur mental state, or if u r lewd, just buy it hehe... (PS cookies to anyone who enjoy me spacing out and typing my daily daydreams, embarrassing XD)
~~~meowwwwww~  take good care of your cats!
%猫?
Cute catgirls do cute stuff. buy it already
Had a brilliant time playing through it and was a good way to pass the time. It was just a good experience in general.   Damn, I'm lonely. :V
This Is Really Fucking Wholesome mate The 18+ DLC MMMM Fucking Delicious.

Utter garbage... the gameplay is stale and uninspired, and doesn't innovate at all compared to the other games in the genre. Not worth your money.
wholesome
I Played this with my friends on discord.        They were the admins
I am a Simple Man. I see Boobs, I Like.
Good games for horny people who like catgirls.

Horny cat

I love nekopara, the writing is so good and wholesome. Chocola and Vanilla as my daughters :) ... I regret buying the 18+ dlc :(
:/
;)
alright this one may or may not have been ironic
This game is fantastic. Highly recommend. DLC is very worth it.
pedophilia
This is a very good game
You like catgirls? You like Visual Novels? If u said yes to both, you'll love this
The fuck you looking at? Keep on scrolling. (•_•) ∫\ \___( •_•) _∫∫ _∫∫ \ \
Bad game has no explosions or guns 0/10
mmm catgirls
I knew damn well what I was going to see when I started playing this game.  What I didn't expect was the shocking realization of just how YOUNG ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE. Played for multiple hours because my friends and I were making fun of the game but my God if you're down in the reviews, this means you're either here to laugh or you're genuinely thinking of buying this game. Even opting to ignore all of the tits, the story does not make up for any of it. Just go watch porn. You'll be better off.
I honestly didn't expect this to grab my attention so quickly.  This is definitely worth it.
hot game pt.3
Catgirl lolis go brrrr
I love game. Is good for degen like me....
Nice
Audio and opening movie do not sync; in fact, the songs for both the opening AND the ending were over before the videos were over. It took a long time for the videos to end.  Since the sound effects of the adult patch are loud, you may also need to adjust them.  The game is short; Vanilla's voice (even with the settings on full) is very quiet, so you might not hear everything she says. Some lines are barely audible that you wish you could hear the voice acting.  Though, it's great to have cute art and Nao's and Haruka Shimotsuki sing the opening and ending! The game is pretty short, but animations are decent.
Nekopara The first game that can burn all of my money... Amazing!! (Well you lucky that I like your work, content, game styles, art styles and more from you NEKO WORKs so here take my moneys TwT) Damn it how long will it take for Elon Musk to make generic cat girl!
perfectly balanced, as everything should be.
BEST GAME EVER
It’s truly a dark day for humanity when a man has to pay money for game with promised nudity and feline fellatio only to find out that all of the nudity and pus*y pus*ies are behind another $10 paywall. It is an insult to my very sense of perversion that Steam and Nekopara think they can take advantage of my gruesome desperation with false labels and promises only to give me the ol’ masterbait and switch. Here I am wasting my time downloading a game, listening to “~nya~” every two seconds, about to tear my hair out only to find out that the game I downloaded, the game I purchased for the sole reason of committing digital bestiality, is actually a hollow shell of what I was promised. I don’t even want my money back, Valve. You can keep your filthy money, at least one of us gets to get off that way. I have to type this review with one hand since the other is icing my blue balls. All I wanted to do was take a calm evening after a long day of work and f**k some cats. Is that too much to ask!? I don’t think so. I’m a humble man, a man of God. I don’t think I was asking for too much here. I just wanted to give my kittens some milk and cream, but instead I sit here left yearning for the fap that might have been, the spank I’ll never yank, the banana I’ll never buff, the guerrilla I’ll never shave. You broke me as a man Valve, I once was a normal functioning member of this society and now you made me into this.
yeah
Pros: Cat girls Cons:
pog as fuck
i still do not own the 18+ dlc
good game，but more love less sex plz，I PLAY GAL FOR LOVEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Now I realised what they meant that I'm Western Polish. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/706282250647371887/828298296732286996/Kcatboy_40264d_8167098.png
If your a fucking weeb and like beating your meat to catgirls.  This is kinda your game. It has a lot of plot, and really helps you actually care.  If you are the type of the person who doesn't the skip the plot in hentai, and want more plot, this is your game.  Also, this shit doesn't come with any of the good shit, you have to factor the cost of the 18+ content into your decision... or you can just pirate a nude patch.
I am a loser but it ok
❤
yes
😳
i like the part where the catgirls uh...   [b] yes [/b]
very fun, who needs a woman anyways?
.
you pay money to hear japanese voice actors lick and moan in your ear while jiggly anime cat girls wear maid outfits on your computer
best game to play while having online lessons
easy achievements lel
10/10 - The best visual novel about catgirls to ever exist. There are no words to say how much I love this game. <3 <3
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Indeed, this game is rather interesting in nature with a volatile soundtrack and immaculate graphics for the modern era. One can assume they will have a very Nyaa~ experience with this video game as the cat-girls are very wide-ranging in nature. As Chocola would say, Meow-Meow! The plot is cromulent with intense dialogue between you the main character and the energetic cat-girls. Sometimes, you may feel an emotional bond with the bodaciousness of the scenery and the individualism percieved. Surreptitious in nature, outstanding in reality. I suggest this game to anyone and everyone, no matter your background as it will make you feel Uu...Uuu...! U-Uwahh!!!!!
Gasm
Money well spent
best fps game i have ever played
I'm sorry mom but I'm into cat girls now
I couldn't help but cry at the end, the story, the art, everything about this seemingly innocent game is truly exceptional. I have never, and probably will never play such a perfect game ever again.
i'm not done but it's okay
would you believe me if I told you I have a gf
haha catgirl go brrrrrrrr
had a great time with em all
nya nya i really want to d1e nya but i love this game nya 10/10
Its fun
I enjoyed my time playing this masterpiece very much it was a good experience yes a very good experience
Good game

Very cute and fun! Highly reccomend this visual novel
Why did I buy this?
A cute, funny, romantic VN involving catgirls working in a bakery and wearing cute uniforms. PLAY IT. You won't regret it.
If only I had a girlfriend ... xD
Yo mama so Danganronpa she NEKOPARA Vol. 1
Its cute and it helped me after playing Steins Gate to not be depressed

cat girls cute :)
It was fine I guess
illegal catgirl nice  didn't nu t   10/10 wholesome get the dlc
It's just pure [b] cuteness. [/b]
A cute and relaxing story about a guy who opens a bakery and his catgirls follow him. There aren't any real stakes in the story, but it is full of nice fluffy goodness. Puts a smile to my face when I read it!  Also, the production quality for this visual novel is really high! Live2Ds really make the characters come to life, Chocola and Vanilla are very cute!
Yes Very noice.
h0rny catgirls
it was a gift i swear
you won't be lonely anymore. 10/10
9
WOW amazingly cringe
If you're a horny weeb who likes catgirls (i.e. me), you should definitely get this game
Catpanions 10/10
hormy
cats
Very moist
i done cummies
NekoParaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I lost
Good booba :]
I came during the cardboard box bondage scene.
I thought this was a standard visual novel when I purchased it, keeping in mind I didn't have the mental capacity to move my focus less than a whole penis length over to the right to see the tags, but my friend quickly found out and gifted me a certain DLC that raised me an eyebrow, and we played it together  In the ensuing hours, I laughed harder than I had all month
8.5/10 even without DLC
So, you wanna hear my opinion on Nekopara, eh? Well, let me tell you all about it... It is the manliest fucking game in the WORLD!!!!!! It is so manly, I gained muscles from playing this game. I also became a member of the beards due to me playing this game. IT IS THE MANLIEST GAME TO EVER MAN MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!! *Explosion sounds in the background*  All jokes aside, Nekopara Vol. 1 is actually a really solid visual novel. It isn't my favorite visual novel, but it is one that I really like. Let's start off with the art style. The art style of Nekopara Vol. 1 is so good, I found myself to be looking at it for a really long time. Another thing that I love about Nekopara Vol. 1 is the characters, goddamn it the characters in the game are so cute, to the point where I want to give them a hug (Oh wait... they are not real, DAMN IT!). The story of Nekopara Vol. 1 is one that I will not say because I want you to play it for yourself (If ya want to, ya don't have to!). Hell, some moments in the game made me laugh my ass off. I have played the other games (0,2,3,&4) and I will admit that they are pretty good. Conclusion: Nekopara Vol. 1 is one of the cutest visual novels that I have ever played. The art is pretty cool to look at, the story is really good, and as I said before, the characters in this game are really cute. I will give this game a 10/10. If you like visual novels or just anime in general, then I would suggest that you buy this game!
It has hentai, therefore it is good. Especially if you are a depressed a$$ fking incel like me!
I really wish my family understood what me and these cat girls have is real love.
nice game
very hot game lolz ;)
Here we go Nekopara Vol.1 The enjoyment that I got from Nekopara Vol.0 leads me to play the Vol.1. This game is very cute that melt my heart. One of the most cute game I ever play. I didn't know if this can be called a game because all u need to do is just hold press the space bar until the game end.. This is really just a visual novel. I do really hope that they at least have an option to choose the action that will lead to some scene/ ending.  The story is really light and can release some stress and I enjoy it, UNTIL the unnecessary scene is come out. YES THIS GAME IS A HENTAI GAME. OMFG!!!   I really didn't know that this is the HENTAI type of game. I really frustrated and disappointed. I already think all the catgirls as my own children and the Hentai scene just turn me off !!! This make me really sad :( I tried to turn off the hentai mode but the story become really weird and unfinished work. That is the sad part of it as I'm not really into hentai. Yes I'm not a man of culture, sorry guys.  Do I recommend this game? If u really love hentai then go for it. I play this game because I'm a cat lover and I enjoy the overwhelming cute chibi character + story they offer (except the hentai scene). I do really hope that one day NekoWorks can make an anime based on this game (without hentai scene).
10/9 very good gaming, lots of women love me now, i am now drowning
This game is a classical piece of literature at its finest! Words alone cannot describe how amazing it is!
Best game
Good Game.
where can i find catgirls like that asking for myself
+story -you will be called degenerate
Good music
one of my fav games everrrr
maybe.   For my purposes the nekos' are too childlike to be entirely comfortable with.    But if this is your bag, enjoy.
Nekogirls are superior to real woman.
This is the best game to ever be created.  this is peak storytelling. Mankind will never see something like this ever again. 10/10
I hate that I liked this.  10/10 would self-loath again.
hahahaha, anime tiddies go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
What am I doing with my life
Love this game a lot, its really funny, and the catgirls is so cute hihihihi
My friend Bean said very good
meow
Great plot great design just great everything does a very good job with hooking you onto the story
I was a boy, now I am a man.
cat girl bobbies, hot.
yes
i think my dad is a felon
I LOVE THIS GA,ME!!!!!!1
god forgive me for I have sinned.
God is dead and I killed him
To put it simply this game sucks. The only reason I own this piece of garbage is because my friend got it for me as a meme. Lets start with the gameplay. There is none. I was able to just go on my phone and talk to a real woman while this played in the background. This game is paying $10 for a book that reads itself to itself. You have no control over the story and thats another thing. The world this story takes place in makes no sense. Like why are humanoid cats kept as pets when they can speak and think for themselves. Also the main character doesnt even have voice acting. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless youre some sad soul who has to play visual novel dating sim games to feel loved. The fact this game has 3 sequels is insulting to the gaming industry. Final verdict 2 cat shits/10.
it's pretty good
this game is very pog and epic. yes
horny
holy based!
Dad, I won.
I PLAYED THIS GAME WITH MY FAVORITE TRUCKER HAT ON AND A GALLON OF MOONSHINE IN MY LEFT HAND
Beautiful art style and soundtrack.
Chef Approved
cat girls poggers
10/10 would recommend cat girls are nice more fun when you force your friends to voice act. 2 of them got caught by their parents in a hentai scene
OMFG, awesome game with 18+ DLC, I'm planing to buy Vol. 4 now
+ Catgirls + Increases your "One Handed"-Skill  kinda liked it.  (18+ DLC has mosaic censorship but you get used to it (at least I did)) ((- 18+ DLC no longer available in Germany, thanks LAndEsMedIeNAnStaLteN))
Yeah it's decent
I called my girlfriend a coomer
is good game 10/10 story epic action scenes and very immersive (;
Pedo game
Let's not beat around the bush here. It's a game about banging cat girls.   Longer version: Cat girls are innocent and sweet. The art is good, the CGs are totally worth the extra couple bucks if you're in it for the porn. There is a decently solid romance story even without the adult patch.  The voice overs are fun enough and if you use windowed mode you can make their boobs bounce if you shake the window a bit.
I gave him the Big Chungus
i barely touched it but it looks decent

Coconut
NEKOPARA IS A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME WITH NO EXPLOITS OR GLITCHES.
NYAN/10
I CAME, I saw, I conquered
you see i bought this originally just to get a cringy backround for my steam which you have to have played at least 2 hours for. but after reading such classic lines that reference borderline pedo shit, i just had to play it all, i now have 3000+ hours and cant stop cooming, i look like the charger from left4dead2, highly reccomend and also buy the fucking dlc you have to pay for, just to get a shitty nudity scene, you degenerates
Chocola and Vanilla sexy time
Make sure to get the DLC for this, it really enhances the immersion into the story
bidoof
lmao
very good
I can't play other games now
In chapter 7 where did he get a tissue from? Unrealistic game.
best game ive ever played
Its nice but I dont like it personally.
10/10 best game ever made
Cats girls are running my life
a worth it experience is all ima say, enjoy guys :3
prefiero MIL veces antes el summertime saga (:
Cute game overall. Yes, it does have its fair share of lewd scenes, but you don't need to view them if you don't have the pack. This game overall is just really cute and I love Chocola.
i can feel my brain cells slowly die and rot away for every second i play this game
sexo
Very good art
Hentai
this game is super epic, it have cat girl and they hot as hell. recomed 10/10
this shiz bussin
this is def not like the anime and that's good this game is kind of a NSFW. The anime made nekopara to be this cute innocent thing but in reality the game came out first and is pretty nsfw and i was surprised when they came out with a anime adaption to this game. This game is pretty adorable but also spicy. A good hentai agme for the price and who can pass up neko girls. 8/10 for me. ENJOY! ⣿⣿⣷⡁⢆⠈⠕⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢔⢂⢕⢄⠂⣂⠂⠆⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂ ⣿⣿⣿⡷⠊⡢⡹⣦⡑⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⢕⢂⠕⠔⠌⠝⠛⠶⠶⢶⣦⣄⢂⢕⢂⢕ ⣿⣿⠏⣠⣾⣦⡐⢌⢿⣷⣦⣅⡑⠕⠡⠐⢿⠿⣛⠟⠛⠛⠛⠛⠡⢷⡈⢂⢕⢂ ⠟⣡⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣑⠝⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡵⢁⣤⣶⣶⣿⢿⢿⢿⡟⢻⣤⢑⢂ ⣾⣿⣿⡿⢟⣛⣻⣿⣿⣿⣦⣬⣙⣻⣿⣿⣷⣿⣿⢟⢝⢕⢕⢕⢕⢽⣿⣿⣷⣔ ⣿⣿⠵⠚⠉⢀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣗⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⢷⣂⣠⣴⣾⡿⡿⡻⡻⣿⣿⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣵⣵⣵⣷⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿ ⢌⠻⣿⡿⡫⡪⡪⡪⡪⣺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃ ⠣⡁⠹⡪⡪⡪⡪⣪⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⠋⠐⢉⢍⢄⢌⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠈ ⡣⡘⢄⠙⣾⣾⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⡘⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠏⠠⠈ ⠌⢊⢂⢣⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⢐⢕⢕⢕⢕⢕⢅⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢜⠠⠈ ⠄⠁⠕⢝⡢⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣕⣑⣑⣑⣵⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢔⢕⣿⠠⠈ ⠨⡂⡀⢑⢕⡅⠂⠄⠉⠛⠻⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⢋⢔⢕⢕⣿⣿⠠⠈ ⠄⠪⣂⠁⢕⠆⠄⠂⠄⠁⡀⠂⡀⠄⢈⠉⢍⢛⢛⢛⢋⢔⢕⢕⢕⣽⣿⣿⠠⠈

I got the new World Record Speed Run for this game come at me :DDDDDDDDDDDD
hahaha opai ggoes boing boing
I just really enjoy the story.                      Nope, nothing else.
Very short. reccomend getting during a sale of you like visual novels 7/10
best game i've played
It's alright.
I uh... I think I need to go outside...
Forgive me lord, for I have fallen into a trap and sinned.
Catgirl. A term used to define a female human-like being with minimal cat features. Simply ears and a tail. However, this term carries a unique sociological connotation. Obviously, catgirls do not naturally exist. Yes, you may cry now. I know I have. However disappointing the fact, the creators of this work poured heart, soul, and determination into this production. Giving us a glimpse into the world where catgirls and humans live together. At a glance, one could objectively state that only perverts are interested in such a situation. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand... I won't deny that fact. Who bought the R18 content. Everyone. That being said, I'd like to make a strong assertion. The narrative, voice acting, art, programming, etc., every aspect of this novel is beautifully polished, a masterwork by my opinion. The fact I only paid $9.99 USD for both the game and R18 content stunned me when I finally completed the story. The interactions with the catgirls, especially Chocola and Vanilla were so organic. At times, they seemed completely like normal girls. And then the story would remind you they had cat-like instincts, which felt endearing as much as it did awkward. Then the adult content. As dramatized as the scenes may have been depicted, I enjoyed the concentration on "mutual benefit". The intensity of the vocals, sound effects, dialogue, and animations made these scenes exquisite. They're erotic yet tasteful enough that both male and female audience could enjoy. If you're considering the purchase, then definitely buy. I guarantee you won't regret it.
pls no if they come in my room
Wholesome content. Play it with your friends, your wife, your kids. Bring it to work and play on lunch breaks. Really great character building and attention to detail in all the right places.
As a child I was brought up with two great fundamentals in life, being true to ones self and don't screw the cat maid, mum doesn't like talking to me anymore
I played this game for the story I swear, defiantly not for the anime titties....
it aight
A surprisingly wholesome experience
I regret being born.
pretty cool. Family Friendly :)
Very difficult to play bcs you are loosing all the time ;)
god i miss her
Very poggers game~  BOOBIS 10/10 WAIFUS 10/10 Neko is life Worth every penny spent on this game. How do I keep this away from my friends and family.  -_-
yes
cute game ^-^
What have I done
Nekopara is definitely not a game, it is a visual novel. There are no decision trees in this novel, it is a story with only one story line. The story, while not my usual cup of tea (so to speak) was enjoyable. I've reread it a time or two. Maybe it has something to do with the fact I like Hentai. Warning to parents...the story is suggestive. If you are a fan of Hentai and all that Hentai is, you'll want to add the DLC.
The stories was very touching and intriguing.

i hate this game, i hate my life for playing it
Nekopara was a game I bought as a joke, but oh boy am I glad I bought this game. I just broke up with my girlfriend and I was looking for something to take my mind off things. I came  to the conclusion after playing this game that 2D girls are better in almost every way, plus they can't break your heart. Enough about me, this is about the game. I love how curvy the characters were drawn. As the saying goes “thick thighs save lives.” I have acquired at least two new waifus from this masterpiece. The author Sayori has peaked as a creative writer. There's no getting better than this. This isn’t a porn game, it’s a stress reliever. Anyways, my mom is calling me. I look forward to reviewing the other games.
its aight
cat girls are ruining my life
How to Train Your Catgirls: The Beginning
epic
Aloha, this is my review of Nekopara a visual novel with catgirls; the first 4 hours are awkward stilted interactions between the MC and the two catgirl roommates/concubines/employees. The final hour has copious corporal cuddling, mayonnaise and meowing. Use headphones. I honestly didn't pay much attention to the plot, I left it running on my other monitor while I play path of exile and watched whenever something interesting happened. If you don't like anime or catgirls, or H-games, why are you even here and reading this far? If you are a man of taste, such as myself, buy it in the name of the merchants guild.  The Good: Good artwork, cute music, Chochola, well animated H-scenes, voice acting is decent, easy 100% achieves.  The Bad: Vanilla and the irritating Oni-chann sister are trash.  The Ugly: Seriously, USE headphones.
Gud
Cat
literally just a game for horny mfs. way overhyped imo
Cat boobies vary Sugoi!!!
The DLC really adds a lot to the... plot.
IM FUCKING CUMMING SO HARD
All the characters are really cute, their VA's fit them amazingly and the artwork is pretty. The sex scenes are fucking hot, really enjoyed them, I get on from time to time to watch them again. 10/10

It's just click to continue
STRONGLY recommend you to get the 18+ DLC or get an uncensored patch as without it you miss a lot of key aspects to the story. Because lets be honest you did not buy this due to your desire to play an innocent game.
it's alright.
Your Honor; If i may, I didn't know she was 9 months old.
Please Elon Musk, we're all counting on you
Came for hentai, stayed for plot 10/10
[h1] ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) [/h1] a good game
noice oppai
very gud
yes
Never has disappointing my parents felt so good
The Single BEST visual novel I have played yet! When I was just a wee little lad I owned several cats over a long period of time, two that always stuck out to me were a brown haired and a white haired, funny enough the brown haired was named chocolate (the white one was named cloud). This was back in 1954, oh how the time has passed. These two lovely cats (catgirls? is that what you youngins call them?) just reminded me of them so much, I went right ahead and bought the 18+ DLC! The Best Mistake one could ever make! I plan on playing the entire series from now on and will look forward to writing more reviews! Until then, gramps signing off, nyah~
Finished in 12 minutes. Holding world record rn. Good game.
caveman noises
So basically I love cats.
it has a titty bounce modifier
Cute among other things.. played out of curiosity and now I must finish all nekopara games
very good anime clicker to enjoy
This game saved my life.  I am 27.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you

Yeah I'll play this over watching hentai.
yes but more
This was a game I ended up playing sooner than I thought I would, thanks to winning Volumes 0-3 in a giveaway (though I needed to buy any 18+ content and other DLC on my own). Without this aspect, this series that every anime fan already knows about would have likely sat in my wishlist for the longest time as it doesn't hit on my favorite niches - not that there's anything wrong with them, but as you'll see, my preferences are elsewhere:  I tend to prefer men to women I tend to prefer kitsunes to nekos and I tend to prefer the idea of [i]serving[/i] a "Master" rather than being in the position of one  If I played a visual novel according to these preferences, it would be entirely different. (Like, if anyone knows dating sims or visual novels where I'm opposite some smug or arrogant kitsune boys, let me know) But, I did get this series for free. I did make sure it was as uncensored as possible before playing, for the "full" experience. And I gave it a shot.  Honestly, not a bad story. It's cute. If it wasn't for the sex scenes, it would be one of the most wholesome reads in my library... still kind of is, actually. Everything is super vanilla, with the most loyal girlfriends you could ask for. Going by the demo I was afraid these girls would be lolis because I thought I remembered they were aged the neko-equivalent to 13 which weirded me out, but that turned out to be my faulty memory and the 13-year-old neko was just a random food vendor they met on the street during chapter 1. False alarm. Vanilla is flat, but she's not a child - none of the nekos are. The little sister-figure, Shigure, is a lot more childlike, but she's an incest-loli character that is flat-out denied basically, so again we are in the clear for there being that much discomfort, in my opinion.  The main two nekos also surprisingly seem to be into each other too, which I'm here for. This is one of the few instances where I can see some form of polyamory happening without any kinks in the machine later down the line. I believe the main three really care about each other by the end.  "the end" in quotes because I still have a good three volumes (0, 2, 3) left in my library alone to explore (and that's without even picking up Extra or 4).
I LOVE THIS GAME!! The jiggle physics are amazing!! I plan on getting more hours and more DLC's so I can see those anime titties :3 Now I have to go clean my screen from all the cum on it!!
haha funny meme hentai chest bouncines  shut up already you reddit meme loving faggot game is bloody awful thanks to steams censorship  damn good catgirls tho or whatever RIP chocola
cat girls
Instantly bought the DLC<3 dont wait  much worth
as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.

Goodness gracious. Came for the "Plot", stayed for the actual plot and the relationship between MC and Chocola+Vanilla. Suprisingly I enjoyed it a lot. Chocola best.
buh buh lo mao
This was a gift from a friend. I ended up surpassing his play time and achievement count, I don't regret it and he also probably does not.  From a weeb to a weeb: thanks for giving me this masterpice.

The best game of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The gun play is actually some of the best I've ever experienced. The story is incredibly deep I won't talk about it for spoilers reasons. The soundtrack is better than doom external's soundtrack by FAR. The stealth missions are very intuitive and fun. The only con I can think of is my parents disowned me and my therapist said I'm too far gone.
Tykkään kissoista
the graphics are so good and the story is really cute, you want to see how it continues. "<3<3<3<3<3" scenes are good too :^3
mom i swear i can explain
used this game to get a faster time in the government watchlist glitchless speedrun any%

i only played to see titties and dicks but for some reason the dick is blurred out???? i dont understand i would like to sue! im very horny milf wanting to see some cock!
Did have sex
I mean, i found it pretty good.
This game is perfect, it drastically improved my sex life, and I've been able to learn Japanese. Much pleasing
its pretty nice
I bought it for the meme. Mistakes were made.
i have a final exam to study for but this game is too fire
Funny 2D cat girls.
poggers
You can run a bakery with your favourite catgirls... It's fun
Yes!
I came here for the "plot." its really good
A masterpiece. It is beyond description.
This is a cute visual novel that you're meant to sit back and enjoy. It actually has cute and complex characters that you want to get to know. I was actually interested through this first game and have shown no shame in purchasing the rest of the story.  Each Nekopara gets better as it goes on, but honestly this one isn't bad at all. It's pretty basic comparatively. But it's lighthearted, and more than enough 'content' to keep you interested. Those interested in animes and visual novels should give it a go! 6/10
its so  wholesome that i just want to melt so yes. oh and the H-scenes are a DLC that is sold seperatly but i can guarantee that it is completely worth it you are sure to love this game
BEST FUCKING VIDEO GAME
I play this game with my cat
cat woman good
Perfect for Doomer 3am playthroughs
I just wanted to play with some cats, not fuck them
go outside
finally started for this series... LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I saw a pussy's pussy 10/10
Being a pretty long-time fan of Sayoris (the artist) work, i bought this game together in a Bundle with the other Nekopara Games (excluding the newly released Part 4 and Nekopara Extra).  If you want the full experience, you will need to buy the R-18 contents for this game seperately because Steam does not allow 18+ content apparently. If you want the full Nekopara experience you pretty much need the DLC. The DLC includes multiple scenes for Vanilla and Chocola, the other girls come in later games.  The Story certainly isn't bad but if you came here for the Story alone, you should probably buy a different VN. Artwork looks gorgeous, especially the R18-Scenes which are animated, albeit only short looping clips. The voice acting seems pretty good too, at least judging by my limited japanese.  In conclusion this is a very good R18 VN (again, with the DLC), i recommend buying it together in the bundle with the rest of the series
They were like daughters... and even lovers.
AH YES masta you purvert
It's Nekopara cute catgirls thats all you need to know
was a good time killer, but i feel like i will never be the same as before playing this. Higly recommend if you want to be disowned
>Buy the game >Play it >Love it >Recommend to my friend >They block me  11/10 will recommend to my new friend again
I thought that Vanilla was the white one. Oh, wait. It was just something on my monitor. Nevermind.  10/10
THIS GAME WAS GREAT! THOUGH DURING IT I GOT REALLY MAD AND SMASHED MY CAPS LOCK KEY SO NOW I'M STUCK LIKE THIS unless i press the shift key BUT THAT REALLY HURTS MY PINKY. BUT THE GAME WAS GOOD. I LIKED THE PART WHERE THE BROWN ONE JUST CUMS RANDOMLY.
9/10 Pretty Kawaii, but way too realistic...
very cat tiddy much wow
cat girls mmmm
a+ boobie
Beautiful game, highly recommended
Has Good Plot
i mean ya know
When I got this I was sad and alone. Now I am happy and alone.

I'm suprised over how much this game took me by suprise, I'm a bit sad tho that I didn't start with Extra first, and thanks to this series, I now have a thing for nekos/catgirls and I'm at the same time not having any shame about it what so ever!!
i am a disappointment to my parents.  good game tho 9/10 would recommend.  nya..
I use this to cope to forget about my love life, can't say I'm disappointed.
Go outside
yes
Kawaii
Playing this wont make her come back. But thats okay, these girls wont leave me.
I never had a pet (ok give me steam points now xd)
Catgirls.

degens rise up

cat girls.
Nekopara is an absolute masterclass of a game. Stunning graphics, visuals, voice acting and amazing gameplay. I fell deeply in love with this stunning game almost instantly. With myself gazing astonished by what I have seen be created. I ask myself each second I play this game: “why couldn’t I have found this sooner?”  With my worries and problems disappearing in an instant as soon as I begin playing I can only say this game is an absolute masterpiece. I’m begging you when I say this, please and I mean PLEASE play this game. It’s perfect in every way and I know you’ll feel the EXACT same way when you play it.  You’ll find yourself not wanting to find real love anymore when you can have the perfect woman right in front of you in nekopara. I strongly advise you seek out your true love in this game.
Boing boing
This is the most boring shit on the planet. Like obviously it's already a VN for coomers, but even in that category it's boring as fuck. Shit sucks. Girls aren't even that cute. Would not recommend.
Final boss was harder than DOOM Eternal's hardest mode
Pretty cool game if you ask me
Shane Dawson simulator does not disappoint  Quite difficult and a little cheesy near the final few bosses, but overall a good game to speedrun, would recommend to any fans of the Souls Series, and Crypt of the Serpent king
My wife left me
Pretty sure my mom thinks I'm a cringe weirdo now, but at least she now knows I'm not gay.
pussy
wholesome fun for the whole family, make sure to also grab the DLC for maximum enjoyment :)
Ex Ex Ex EXPLOSION!
very good 200/10 would recomend
yess
This will leave a scar that will never be healed
hey god it's me again
amazing
nekopara sure does have some scary implications about its world. i try not to think about it because its a silly catgirl game but there's just some things that are kinda f'd up about this story's world. anyways, this game took me four years to complete
better than danganronpa!
if you are feeling like to suicide play this game
what a fucking game bro 10/10
Nyah <3
This game is le epic poggers nyaaaaaaaa
What have I done to myself.
NEKOPARA vol.1
Best game ever, so good love it. PLEASE MORE <3 Love the jiggle physics too! Super fun.
Protip: Get the 18+ DLC  Jokes aside, Nekopara is more of a visual novel than a game, where the player only needs to click the mouse (mostly with his left hand) to advance the story. With superb voice acting, awesome animation (you can even adjust the bounciness), mixed with an interesting story (catgirls?) and cherry music, this is the must play NSFW game on Steam if you're looking to blow off some steam. There's even the pixelated Japanese treatment.  11/10   (P/s: Forgive me lord, for I have sinned)

Great to play with 6 months old catgirl (  appearance of 12 to 13 years old girls).  But you need to buy DLC, fully family friendly without it, but what is the point?
fun for the whole family
Cute story-line and characters. The DLC for the game is worth it, you get a lot of extra content. I bought the DLC about halfway through the game so I can't say for sure what the entire censored version of this is like but I enjoyed the first half well enough to buy it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes catgirls or anime related media. The art is amazing, this is quickly becoming one of my favorite series.
FORGIVE ME FATHER FOR I HAVE SINNED! . . . . . . . . . AND SO DID YOU!
hahaha Boing boing boing
This is a pretty charming, and at times emotional visual novel, while the thought of catgirls may not go through everyone, especially those who are not familiar with the whole modern anime culture and all of that, i'd say if you're looking for a light and cute visual novel to read, this one is pretty nice
buy it
Wholesome Christian Content? - Check Extrinsic And Intrinsic Moral Development Opportunity? - Check Presents A Fun Interactive Experience In Which Parents And Their Children Alike Can Bond? - Check Lewd Anime Cat Girl *** and **** with massive ******* ? - Check  .... *whimpers*

as a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked catgirl in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also am very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex.
although my favorite catgirls are maple and cinnamon, of which you DO NOT fuck in this game, i strongly recommend this game just for the sole fact that chocola and vanilla are p hot ngl
As Jesus once said. Wow catgirls rock.
My friend gifted me this and I am now addicted
pussiecats with catpussies have jiggle physics
Another volume of Nekopara calls for another 69 screenshots of cat girls, sex innuendos, and achievements! :D DON'T FORGET TO PRESS P ; FOR THE BITTIES. <3
This is an amazing visual novel, very wholesome story. 10/10.
SOMEONE GIFTED THIS TO ME AND I LOVE IT, IT IS LIKE HAVING A SECOND LIFE BUT WITH CATGIRLS!!!!!! AND YOU CAN HAVE le sex <3 WITH THEM AHHHAAHAHA YES, NOW  THIS IS MY KNID OF GAME THIS SHIT DESERVES GOTY!!!!!! SO GOOD SECS IS NICE WHEN CHOCOLA IS SECS AHAHAHAHHAAHAHA; BEST FPS HORROR GAME EVER!!!!!
good game for sure #notaweeb
I love Vanilla and Chocola.
Good dystopian vn about a last male on earth living in a world run by women and mutant cat girls ,where the slavery and human trafficking is on daily basis. The main protagonist is trying to survive in those hard times by running a cafe with his two mentally ill slaves.
I can't look at my cats the same way ever again
Short but challenging game. Highly recommend if you're into Dark Souls difficulty. Chapter 5 was where it started to get challenging but the DLC REALLY helps you get from point A to B just be patient. All in all, worth every penny. :)
~~uwu~~
My life was in shambles after the pandemic hit us, I didn't know what to do and my Wife left me. After settling the divorce papers and her taking away my only son. I sought out purpose in my life. After playing only one hour of Nekopara, I was filled with a sense of pride and self worth. I found my reason to live, and despite my wife leaving me, and my son never being able to see me again, I would choose Nekopara over having them back any day.
Good little visual novel really enjoyed the story, I recommend reading/viewing this game before watching the anime it came out before the show. [h1]Catgirls are cute[/h1]
C A T G I R L S
a german bought me this game  game of the year
dog
pov:  you've never felt a woman's touch
highly recommend after getting this game I`ve had copious amounts of sex
neko girls are kawaiii ( recommended ) PLS AWARD ME IM POOR
yes
hardest game ive ever played
If you want an honest opinion on the game than the answer is yes  DEFINITELY buy it no questions asked just do it need more proof? read the other reviews.
The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement in China from 1966 until 1976. Launched by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China (CPC), its stated goal was to preserve Chinese Communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China as Maoism) as the dominant ideology in the CPC. The Revolution marked Mao's return to the central position of power in China after a period of less radical leadership to recover from the failures of the Great Leap Forward, which contributed to the Great Chinese Famine only five years prior.
ass
im going to jail
10/10 Best game ever. Why? Catgirls.
Don't be an uncultured peasant, play uncensored and enter the gates of cat girl heaven or roast in hell.
ohhh yeah ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
you already know what youre looking for if you found this game. it has it.
vanilla...best...catgirl...
Best game i've ever played.
I guess it's worth the money. if you are ManOfCulture
смысл жизни - Кошкодевочки
I want a pet cat for once.
Asked a friend nervously to buy this game for me; Gave me the stink eye in a comedic manner
I only have one thing to say for you who is considering whether or not you should play this game or not: cat girls.
I feel nothing but disdain from my father now
guys the woman is actually a cat and she acts like a cat but she's basically human
The term "culture" is a somewhat difficult concept to describe in a concise manner and greatly differs from person to person. To some, "culture" refers to customs, tradition, and common themes that regularly circulate one's society. To others, "culture" relates to achievements and progress by a group or nation that expresses the blossoming of a commonly experienced lifestyle. To me though, the term "culture" is one that is synonymous of only the finest cultured visual novels available for purchase, with Nekopara being one of the greatest and highly praised titles to top this list.  Nekopara has become one of the most prized and celebrated titles in the world of "cultured" visual novels that has never failed to disappoint from the day of its release; becoming somewhat of a modern classic whos content will prove to endure for the many years to come. Upon beginning the game, players are graced with a number of the most fine examples of catgirls the world of visual novels has to offer, most prominently being the two main catgirls of vol.1, Chocola and Vanilla. The mix of these two very different but very close catgirls offer an astounding fusion of personality, befitting the tastes a very wide range of enthusiasts with a masterful blend of loli and tsundere traits that leave very little to be desired. Throughout the various chapters of Nekopara, the reader will experience an awe inspiring story that is brimming with concepts and emotional sequences that would challenge even the most battle hardened players to not shed a tear in its climax.  Nekopara has proven itself to be a game that defines its generation, offering the community a source of "culture" that is simply put, unrivaled, among other visual novels and the many other games that fill the vast pages of the Steam store.
Good animation, Good Dabing, Fine story. Too bad the steam doesn't contain a 18+ version. Even though that version is censored.
more reasons to live
Cute anime nekos with tiddies
I am in pain.
Changed my life. Enlightning.
I Love this game so much
really good storyline and decent ammount of time to finish this great game
I regret nothing.
This game is my favorite game ever and i swear to you i have not used this late at night many times. I DEFINITELY only downloaded it for the story because it is very good yes. I believe everyone should get this along with that funny little side content because it just makes the gaming experience quite a bit better. I truly recommend this to everyone who reads this because why would you not possibly want cat girls in your life.
two words: Cat Girls. That is all.
This is a 10/10 story rich game!!! Buy it now if you haven't already.
(Played without installing adult patch)  To be honest, this is one of the cutest and best visual novel ever in my life. Beside their cute characters movements and useful interface, the storyline of this novel is carefully placed and illustrative. The picture works are almost excellent in quality. Would definitely recommended people who like maid and cat to have a try. Worth a price!! ^w^  Chocola and Vanilla..... they sure are cute and honest =w= I really hope they exist in real life >w<
When I saw the tags for Nekopara, I assumed it would be something akin to HuniePop, where the most you see are tatas and nippies with some panty shots. Boy was I wrong. Assuming that Vanilla and Chocola are actually 9 months old, they are very under-aged in human years as a cat that is 1 year old is estimated to be in the range of 15-23 in human terms. Due to this (and the fact that I'm gay), I sped through the very well drawn and animated love-love scenes in order to return to wholesome catgirl content.  Anyway, the story and characters are very cute and did manage to put a smile on my face multiple times!
whats worse the fact that i bought nekopara out of boredom or the fact that i was sad and didnt want to play it after i found out there was nudity
why cat hot
cats
Then said Jesus, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"
Once in a lifetime you'll come across a game that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of this game. After all, Nekopara? Will this game even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 6 hours and 1.42 minutes of my life. The game started out strong. The opening scenes enticedme  with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth playthourgh of the game where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 21st century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the game could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main cat protagonists, Chocola and Vanilla, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential cat such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interracial dynamism. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the game began. I was so enticed by the game that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the game. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of this game? Am I inside the game right now? This game will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the game, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in this game. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the game so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the game was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the game. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to play the game in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable without catgirls. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. Nekopara Volume 1 literally ruined my life. 10/10
not fun, my life is ruined
Great game Worth my 20 bucks (I bought the collection during a discount)
eh
catgirls.
I have never played an visual novel or knew what nekopara was about untill I bought the first vol and played through it all and omg. it was so emotional and perfect, I never had such an fun time getting attached to characters as I did with chocola and vanilla, it was always an blast and I went on an binge taking my time enjoying all the moments throughout every chapter, it is honestly the best series to get into visual novels, it will make you laugh, smile,cry and so much more
;)
(ﾉ*ФωФ)ﾉ what are you waiting for? buy this game
It's Nekopara.
This game is an absolute masterpiece. Truly a one of a kind experience. There is no point in the game that will ever leave you bored. The story is engaging and keeps you hooked at what may happen next and ends wonderfully, leaving you wanting more! Luckily, there are more volumes... WITH DLC!!!!! Nekopara Volume 1 is an amazing game with an amazing story, unique characters, lovely art, great voice acting, and sequels just as good as the first. I highly recommend picking up this game as well as the others in the series!
catgirls. that is all.
This is where it all begins!

Mad poggers

Pro tip: try pressing 'P'

NEKOPARA is a visual novel set in Japan where they have biologically spliced human DNA into cats creating the abominations known as "Catgirls". These cat girls are humanoid looking with feline characteristics such as tails and cat ears on their head. The catgirls are intelligent beings capable of speaking human languages and complex thinking yet Japan permitted that people could own catgirls as human property, It is even socially acceptable to have a emotional and sexual relationship with catgirls. The Japanese society is running on what I would call a Pseudo-Sharia Law concerning the catgirls as they are not permitted to walk in public without a "bell" or the owner...

10/10 i want to fap on cat girls again
Great game to play with Family and Friends! :)
nice
dont like that the catgirls are nine and also slaves
yes
catgirls :( <3
Honestly an amazing game. Cute catgirls. Good story. Great... plot... And way more entertaining than the tv show or movie.
The story is so fricking cringe.  This is basically everything that you think of when you try to imagine a weeb story as cliché as possible. It's catgirl slice of life hell to the point where you'd think this is a cute visual novel meant for girls but then it also has the really awkward and pervy h-content which completely ruins the image of it just being a relaxing story about running a bakery with your catgirls.  The game explains the h-content as the protagonist needing to help out his catgirls who are in heat but the game has the protagonist consider them family (uh oh) and in-universe none of the catgirls are independent they are basically just more useful pets and fully depend on their owners which makes the h-stuff just weeeeird and fetishy.  HOWEVER if you are actively looking for that kind of content It's really high quality with its art and voice acting and also often very cheap to get
I promise i didnt touch myself while reading the novel
This is the best game of all time
This is a... really good game.. highly recommend the DLC
This is just too fucking strange for me
Nekos that loves their master. Do I still need to explain?
ye
Shane Dawson loves this game
p key very good, yes, 10/10 would spam again
better purchase then cyberpunk for sure. Graphics are truly impeccable and the story is top notch so far.
Yes.
Played it a bit.
I hate myself
It's about nekos....
Two years worth of semen made a glopping noise as it flowed endlessly into Chocola
Played vol.0 was good this one is even better

Vanilla is best kitty girl. 💕
Ohohoo
GG
It's So Good Game Semi H3ntai!. Just trust me if u want see it just buy DLC 18+ it's will unlocked 18+ content!!!!. But still mosaic censorship but for me it's best for way not getting this game banned at steam :)

Very Neko, Very Nice 10/10
so fresh so clean
Horny
This game changed my life for the better.
I love this visual novel because of the lovely story it has. In my opinion its really wholesome and the art style really suits the characters. For me, the story draws out a lot of emotions and it has a really good music that enhances the story. 10/10 I would recommend this to anybody who is into anime.
The Nekopara series is truly motivating to any aspiring pastry chefs out there. Aside from that the artwork is phenomenal, paired with the intricate plot this is a master piece. The characters are very likable, Take vanilla for example she is just a kindhearted cat girl who truly loves Kashou but does not come out until later in volume 1. Chocola is another example of an amazing character, she is just like vanilla for she loves Kashou deeply, however she is just a little more likable because of her joyful and happy attitude. That said Vanilla still holds a deep place in my heart because of her Calm and quiet attitude and will always be my personal favorite in the Nekopara series. However the two paired together are Perfect, take the shower scene for example it was just exhilarating to see that kind of balance between the two cat girls. To wrap it all up Volume 1 of the Nekopara series was truly enjoyable and will continue to be my personal favorite visual novel series.
Okay, so right off the bat let me be clear, outside of the catgirls there are a lot of problems (and the catgirls are a problem unto themselves).  The novel, because there are no interactions/decisions and it therefore isn't a game, is boring and mediocre.  Characters are more two dimensional than the art, and there's nothing interesting or exciting to hold up the plot.    Now on to the big problem of the catgirls.  I love catgirls, I grew up watching tokyo mew mew, and one of my first crushes on a fictional character was Ichigo monomiya from that series, so I'm willing to overlook a lot if there's catgirls involved.  THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, and I imagine it's not what a lot of other people are going to be looking for either.  What I want is a girl with cat features and aspects, not a cat in a humanoid body.  I don't want to fuck a cat, but you do so in this game *repeatedly*.  And on top of that, they're literally less than a year old!  Even in cat years they'd be under age!  The main character even *EXPLICITLY* says that he sees them as children, and this is *AFTER* he bangs both cats.  I got this game a while back from humble bundle, and I can safely say this would not have been worth the money even at the current price of 4$, especially not since the 18+ dlc (that I do not own) is a separate purchase of equal price to the game!  TLDR: don't play this game unless you really want to put your dick in a cat
good buy
I haven't gotten past the main screen because I start convulsing when hovering over the start button.
Maybe the real treasure is cats you made out with along the way?
Nice
I smash catgirls 'cause they're cute. Now with +18 patch on steam
i like it
Kawaii!~ :)
Amazing, just one of the best novels ive ever seen.
The single best game i have ever played yet, going to be buying the next volumes soon, will be good  Also the chest bouncies slide bar in the options menu is much appreciated as a man of culture.
Ye
Cute VisNovel about a bakery chef opening his first pastry shoppe, and two adorable catgirl stowaways who followed him away from home! The art is very pretty and the music is charming, the story is easy to follow and the characters are likable. Download the 18+ DLC for extra content! ;)
catgirls
its like reading a light novel but more immersive
1. ITS FREAKING NEKOPARA 2. Has a nice story to it, so why not? 3. I am a Vanilla kinda girl between the those 2 sisters... BUT i gotta say Coconut all the way more 4. If you aren't sure try the demo, then come back and get all Nekopara games in a bundle if possible 5. Like i say you gotta find the right key and they just looovvveeeee jumping... if you catch my drift
I originally bought this game as a meme for me and my friend, I could never have guessed that it would change my life for the better. Since playing my ♥♥♥♥ grew 15 centimeters, my voice has grown deeper and I became half a meter taller. god bless
buy this for your kids lol
Very cute and innocent game to gift to your kids for Christmas!
I like the grass. Its nothing quite special but it still provides for my standards of grass.
pain.  edit: pain.
JUST  BUY THE DAMM GAME ALREADY IT's WORTH IT
The timeless classic, the game that started it's own the most acclaimed visual novel franchise, and complete masterpiece in terms of gaming experience - yes, I'm talking about Nekopara vol. 1 - the game that scored many rewards and conquered the hearts of thousands of players. It's hard to review trying to find any flaws in this piece of art, but I'll try to be as much subjective as possible.    Visual novel takes place in alternative timeline, where humanity finally achieved their long avaited dreams - genetically engineered catgirls. The world itself may sound like an utopia, but the truth it's more darker than anyone could imagine.    Catgirls aren't treated like humans, they don't have any basic rights, which mostly end up as them being used as slaves to do human labor for the price of some food. Some of them instead, are treated like a pets for human entertainment.     The story begins with introduction of the main character - Kashou - young adult, who runs away from his parents that don't accept him for his passion of baking. He has a dream of starting his own business and live a fulfilling live without pressure from his family. We're thrown into the scene where Kashou finds out his sister send him two catgirls to help him survive in his solitude.     The story focus on showing the basic laws of this cruel world - even the youngest catgirls are thrown into the never ending circle of labor - as well as showing us the growing relationship between main character and his catgirls. By retrospections we also learn about sad story of the sisters. Kashou decides to make the future brighter not only for himself, but tries his best to support girls and make them smile. He doesn't know that his sister will soon visit him again...    In the end, I give this game solid 9/10. Character designs, music, and captivating story - the only downside is the dlc that was ripped of the full game and sold separately for better profit. But tossing that aside, it's a true masterpiece.
what do you mean the two youngest catgirls are 14 human years old
yes
NekoPara will always be my favorite visual novel- besides the mixed 'puzzle' game- Corpse Party~!  　∧＿∧ （｡･ω･｡)つ━☆・*。 ⊂　　 ノ 　　　・゜+. 　しーＪ　　　°。+ *´¨) 　　　　　　　　　.· ´¸.·*´¨) ¸.·*¨) 　　　　　　　　　　(¸.·´ (¸.·’*
Overall  I guess it would recommend this.  Girls are cute, HSCENES are <3, and story is really cute. I had a fun time playing it. However I 100% the entire game in 3 hours, and the sound effects during the HSCENES are kind of cringe.  If you want something cute and have the money to burn then go for his.   Also don't sleep on Maple.
Lovely <3
It was a cold night, my girlfriend of two years had just broken up with me and i had finished all of the anime I had on my crunchy roll and funimation list. Twas nothing to do but sit and wait. Until one day later i log into steam to see a friendly message. Dear Kakashi I know times have been rough but it will get better. Please enjoy this game to its fullest.                             So I did. But the thing i didnt know was that I would soon be consumed for my love of catgirls and lolicons. Is it wrong? You may ask. It is wrong, it is very wrong. But if I'm going to be sent to hell for one sin why not make it a million.
With the patch, I ascended beyond the next level.
Its good
Thought it'd be cute and I could interact somehow.  Just got a pervy story I clicked through aimlessly. So get it if you like the second line I guess.
What the actual f*ck
it cool
only missing catboys
Nya~
CatGirls , thats all
ITS NEKO PARADISE GODDAMIT! WHAT MORE DO I NEED TO SAY!
Are ya winning son?
i am a disappointment to my parents
yes dad, i am winning.
10/10 would bang vanilla again
I am touch starved and this fill the void in my heart ;( pretty fucking great game
i have peered into the void, and now i cannot return.
h
Longer than I expected it would be, but that's a good thing. Worth the price and very cute! The art is amazing and lots of clear effort was made. Fully recommend to anyone who loves anime-style visual novels!
the game of our generation
I've crossed the event horizon playing this visual novel and there's nowhere to go but down from here
I don't think i have enough playtime to recommend this, but so far the first screen looks nice.
Very Good Game Sex Good Boing Boing Jiggle Good
Amazing visual novel!  This game made me really like catgirls.
Someone told me that I wasn't a true weeb until I've played this game so here I am.
nya
boobei
Putting aside all the obvious "My friends and colleagues shun me but I'll be damned if I'm playing this offline" jokes  Can we talk about how catgirls as a whole in this universe seem capable of reaching a formal operational level of cognitive development, as well as an ability to achieve verbal mastery of a language in six months? That means that, being conservative, catgirls are over 20x faster at cognitive development and 8x faster at language acquisition than your average human.
cat girls are best girls
Heh... I have depression after playing this game
fuck cat
This isn't a game, this is totally visual novel. But I enjoy a bit for being bestiality.
Gracias a este juego ya se que darle de comer a mis gatos (っ˘ڡ˘ς)

Really good story and excellent artwork. One of my favorite visual novels and anime series.
tiddies
"guys I swear I bought it as a joke I'm gonna clock four thousand hours it'll be funny"
This game is calm and relaxing, and all around fun. If you have issues with any form of sexuality in media then I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like AO content and like love and fluff with kawaii cat girls then this is for you.
Great game to play with friends and family, cured my depression.
HELL HE IS SMOOTH
yes
the big PP
it wasn't even fun ironically
This is TOO GUD for CAT LOVERS
Havn't bought the game yet but i saw cat girl and i thought it would be another boring tap and click story neko game but as soon as i was abt to look at a diffrent game my dick grabbed the mouse and forced me to watch it and before i knew it my dick was jacking its self off! now i bet your wondering how that happends... well i don't know either but appearently dicks know what they want and it wanted the nekos... Please help my dick is still beating it self and wont stop.
I bought this game without realizing these were actually the safe for work versions of adult games.. If you take it for what it is in this version and don't think too much about the fact that this is intended to be a porn game.. it is quite charming and has cute cat girls.

furry porn.... update im no longer have a hard on
Name a better game i wait
[spoiler] the catgirls were having their heat period [/spoiler] And that was a blissful time until i ended up in the local police department .  .  Anyway the game is pretty enjoyable and the ost hits differently Probably one of the best eroge so far idk
I'm glad this masterpiece exists also my "P" key broke
Yes
VN Game full of female cats in their mating season  Recomended for cat lovers
As a true gamer, I can wholeheartedly endorse Nekopara Vol. 1 The plot had me on the [b]edge[/b] for hours, the action had my [i]blood pumping[/i], and the whole experience left me hungry for more.  10/10, purr purr purr
There were more nuts in this game than a Snickers commercial.
It was a good investment...
cat girls... any more questions? shut up and take my money!
Watched this with the boys on discord and it really lifted our spirits.

I wanna fuck a Catgirl.
Listen i love hentai and eroge games just as the next guy and you can see that just by looking at my library, but damn i was expecting a masterpiece because of the reviews and i got a meme garbage, what a fucking misleading cliche game, Terrible, absolute trash not worth the price, well received only because it's a meme game and it has practically lolis in it, i can't believe steam hasn't banned this shit yet as child porn, like they already did on other titles, but yeah they get the pass because they are "not human", similar to the known excuse as the lil girl that have 7816.72 years old.  Terrible history and super cliche, it's obvious what is going to happen at the end and a obvious cliff anger so they can have more people buying the sequels, but not gonna buy em because it's obvious what is going to happen the MC is going to fuck everyone even his underage step-sister.  God fucking dammit.  Wish i couldn't played this for more than 3 hours so i could get my money back, absolute cringe game, and i know cringe since I'm a furry and ironic since people constantly tell me to kill myself for being one, yet the same people that told me that, play this garbage full of obvious underage girls just for the meme.  God dammit after playing this i practically now fell proud of being a furry instead of a weeb.  And no catgirls are not furry, shut the fuck up.

great game
catgirl funny, my friends hate me but it was worth the lewd cats
cat girls
Despite being one man, the developer of this game really knows what his fans want. On Friday, I had burned my hand with flaming oil and stayed eight straight hours in a neglectful "healthcare" facility that took eight hours to bandage my recently singed flesh. This left me with very limited use of my left hand, thus rendering me unable to play most games as they tend to require two hands. This hero of a developer kept his clientele in mind, and made it so this game could easily be played with one hand. I can tell just by that design choice that this is an upstanding Christian man who had developed a wholesome Christian game. Obviously this game was designed for people with limited mobility such as myself, as I cannot think of any other reason why this game should be played with one hand. These design choices lead me to believe that there is still hope left for humanity, 10/10.
Neko's will rule the world
Good luck at NNN
Oh dear lord i swear this was a gift, i didn't mean to play an hour of it, i thought it was a game about cats...
there are a few games quite like this one as you come for cat girl porn but then something starts to entice you and you start to feel yourself wanting more and more of these characters. You get drawn into the plot and become interested in how the story will progress. This leads to you realizing that you are enjoying it for the actual plot and the writing has you hooked and there is no going back. After this point you realize that speeding forty dollars on cat girl hentia is for the plot and anyone that says otherwise needs to play this game. You except yourself for what you are and enjoy nekopara like the chad you are. And one final note, if you play this game offline you are a little bitch and you know it.
yea its good
Forgive me god for I have sinned.
help
niceuuu
This is the best FPS game everyone should try. The cats are cute. GOTY
nice 10/10  i nut on my cat
Fun game.
Relaxing with a nice well developed story.
If you check out any Visual Novel I say give this one a look. It has cute catgirl, and if you into it you can see the goods but I really do not think that is really worth the extra 10 or doubling the cost. If you know where to look you can get the 18+ content without the extreme overpriced tax.  One of the few games I would say is worth the asking price. IMO most games are not but this one is well worth the cost.

You can feel your dead ancestors' shameful glare on you as you play the game. And yet you soldier on knowing they will never know the true joys of being a Catgirls owner.
bad. its not good.
rate this review if ur a pedophile
I play this game for the plot
And then a friend got me a catgirl VN...    Nekopara is a Visual Novel where you get laid with catgirls!  That's what this game is!  You play this in order to overwhelm yourself with naughty feelings, and they will likely involve ladies with cat ears and tails!  Anyway, beat it in 4 hours using a keyboard and mouse.  The game has no difficulty; it's a VN.  Very adult.    - There are 8 chapters total, each running roughly 30 minutes of listening to voices in Japanese with accompanied text (in English, Japanese, or Chinese.)   - The game is just reading text.  There's nothing ground-breaking here like multiple choices or choosing what you say.  You're in this for the read.  - The menu has pictures, videos, and music from the game to access at any time after you beat the game.  - The base game is censored and lacks the kinkier scenes.  To get the 'full' game you have to pay extra for the +18 patch.  Even so, sex is still heavily implied and cannot be ignored.  Though why you'd get this without wanting the 18+ junk is beyond me.    - There is no TissueBox DLC.  You will have to acquire that on your own accord outside the main game.  - P.  PP.  PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.      In summary, Nekopara is one of THOSE games.  If you're into lewd PssPssPss, you will very much like this game.  If you're into catgirls or furries, well, read the last sentence.  If you're a parent getting this for your kid, wtf?  Why would you do that?  What's wrong with you?
i have sinned
Just buy a bundle to get all of them. Its better than buying individually. Trust me

MAN COME ON FIX THE STEAM CLOUD BUG. ALL OF MY SAVE DATA WAS GONE  I LOST ALL THE PUSSIES
This game is a nice little story for anyone who just wants something sweet and simple with awesome characters! Most fans or buyers are those who want to experience the lewd parts of the series however if you're like me and want an opinion on the safe version of the game is just for a casual and comfy experience; you've come to the right review. I can understand that it feels like you would be missing out on the content as they hint at the lewd scenes but don't show them in the safe version, however if you have watched the anime before playing then you will be shown more scenes in the visual novels that were cut out of the anime which is nice. Overall if you wish to have a safe for work experience with the games then its pretty good, you get all the same plot points as those who play with nsfw content, the only thing they get is just imagery and 'fapping material' lmao. I love this series and I hope that this review helped you with the choice of getting into it! My favourite Nekos are Coco and Azu btw ^v^
The catgirls are cute, a classic. What else?
nya nya
Playing this game makes no-fap easier.
good game but my roommates now think i'm beyond saving
This made me realize my ethereal needs for catgirls.
tyujf
overall, a very good game.
PogU game

This game is really good and has a lot of gameplay I really recommend it for people that like novel games.
adowable and cwute UwU     NYAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO
One of the best games i`ve ever played
ah yes, the shane dawson game where you F*** your cats, 10/10 would play again. plus at the end, the MC run to find his cats while getting sick, good god, he's immortal.
Nice
Wonderful game. I wholeheartedly enjoyed every second of it. An amazing start to an amazing series.
of course, great game. highly recommend
super cute, really loved seeing chocola nyaa~ 💖🍫
Yes

If I die alone in my apartment I hope my cat girls eat my corpse
I do not wish to be horny anymore.  I just want to be happy, with my little naked cat girls.
hmmb... titty
10/10, Chocola and Vanilla are precious. Coconut has a pair of coconuts, shame I'm allergic </3  My goal in life, become a cat girl, find a master. ^.^ #Kawaii

Just beautiful. Nothing more to say. I need a catpanion.
What Vanilla says about you is 100% correct!
Love this game its very cute and nice to play :)
Finished a long time ago, just forgot to review because I couldn't stop playing and immediately finished the rest of the sequels, and yes this visual novel is a MASTERPIECE, not only does it have a great plot, it also has what a man could ever ask for. Buy the game and see for yourself <3    Update: Nominated for awards <3
yes
My cat caught me playing this game, i haven't been able to looked at him in the eyes since...
Hello everyone, I want to update this review since Nekopara Vol.4 is coming out in 24 hours. I have changed to it be more serious as that is how strong my feelings are about this series.  There are many things in life which I like and dislike. But there are only a few things in life of which I can say without hesitation that I love...  I love Nekopara  I don’t care if people call me names or call me a loser or think of me as a weirdo. I don’t care if people compare Nekopara to another game or think something else Is better. I don’t care about the future sacrifices I’ll have to make for my love. I just don’t care, because…  I love Nekopara and I will always love Nekopara.  Thank you everyone for being so supportive. I hope to play Volume 4 just as much, I know I will already love it, I hope you do to.

i fucking love catgirls
No comment.
It's super good
No one told me this was originally a H game so now my Steam history is tainted.
Shigure best imouto
I can see why people have thousands of hours, was pleasantly surprised. Now I am on a quest to play them all.
nice h3ntai i like it
not bad
its catgirls. cmon
Played it for the plot.  Cured my depression but gave me diabetes.  Totally worth it 11/10
You don't have to like cats or girls to like catgirls
catgirls.                         that is it. thats the entire review.
nice
Great game with amazing story. I really love the character progression and personalities of each character. Also cat girls anime titties 10/10. Also I really love the feature involving the p button.
all I gotta say is that it was interesting and it got even more interesting with the 18+ adult only content
pretty dang poggers ngl
It's ok.
yes
Vanilla > Chocola. Cat girls in maid outfits yes please
and here i thought this was a daily life with cats game but i was wrong
Yes BUY IT
for all of my friends on steam, I'm sorry
Incredible. Absolutely phenomenal. Utterly Extraordinary. Quite positively astonishing.
ok
Yes.
I used up all my energy to convince my parents to buy this for me.
You run pâtisserie. With catgirls. Sometimes you headpat the catgirls. Nothing weird here.
Same as the "prequel". Less interesting Story than 0 but the Animations are good. Still, you're better off not buying the steam version.   Also, badge crafting is hella expensive
this is one of the best hentai VN Games out there  i do recommed this game
My dad doesn't look me in the eye anymore but the catgirls are nice
Catgirl milkies~
real art
cummies
A wholesome game for the whole family to enjoy.
A good game that is pure, unfiltered, culture.
I was never here... and I do not own the 18+ dlc.
Nekopara is a eroge game which mean a lot of ecchi scenes you might don't want to play it with public. The game storyline quite good and got some in-depth character development between these two catgirls (Chocola and Vanilla). The walkthrough of the game is not long but average 5/6 hours by completion of reading the dialogs (Noted that I played less hours to I'm a offline player). If you just chasing for the ecchi scene, it's could be shorter but seriously don't since you don't enjoy the game that way. Language wise for English are simple and not that hard to read. And yes the game have normal Visual Novel Save and Load if you really wanted to know.  Tbh this was my first ecchi visual novel and worth to buy it. If you wanted to access more info about the ecchi scene, you could buy the DLC through the game. Or you could play it like normal and can find ways to access more clear ecchi scenes throught Community Guide.  10/10 Catgirls never made me so happy to keep them.
I nut to this game.
may the god forgive us
Good story but way to short for my liking
cute catgirls
catgirls.
I would recommend. Really does take your mind off the real world. (also cute af)
I bought this for my little sister.
My friend (who loves to play with slime) reccommended this game. Good TASTE!
ah its fun and little romantic  i really thought to refund when i bought it so i could go for Shooter or some other But when i played first chapter its funny slowly its turning into romantic and more funny.. u could play this and no need to wait for sale its worth it..cant wait to play other vols
This game changed my life you fuck the cat girls 10/10
No comment.
this game sucks ass my dick was NOT hard i even bought the DLC  oh BTW theyre 9 MONTHS OLD!! 1/5 stars  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME NOT WORTH IT
I was looking for a lewdish game with cute anime girls but not to a point where things get weird.(ie.Exploding anime girls ect..)  This game was what I was looking for it had it's lewd scenes but nothing that would get me sent to hell for looking at. I relly enjoyed this and totally reccomend it for people looking for a nice heartwarming anime catgirl party.
Idk cool boobies
Im Eric, Im 16. I love anime, and manga, watching, and playing basketball, drawing, video games (my favorite video game is NEKOPARA), food, and cuddles, and love! Im 5'10", 140lbs. Im also blonde, green eyes, and handsome, and my favorite colors are blue, and red, and my favorite food is pizza. 9/27/18 is the day I started watching anime (my first anime ever was Eromanga Sensei, I know it is an interesting choice xD), so please dont judge my list xD. I like all kinds of anime (action, slice of life, romance, comedy, drama, etc). Im a cool, sweet, mature, romantic, caring guy who loves hanging out with friends, and I try to make everyones day! My secret weapon is my charm, so please be my friend xD. Also follow my social medias, thank you! I try to watch anime weekly too, and Akeno Himejima from High School DxD is my favorite character in anime of all time. She was the first female character I liked when I first started watching anime, and the character who I looked up to the most. Shes a big reason why I watch anime. Shes really special to me, and I loved her for a long time. Shes my waifu, and I love her a lot. She will always be the most special character in anime to me, because she was the first female character I loved, and looked up to. She can't be replaced, because shes so special to me, and shes my waifu, and I love her. Shes the most special character in anime to me. Theres no one like her. I know that may sound weird, but all anime fans feel that way about a character :). RIP my 3 heros, XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD, and Kobe Bryant ;(. I also like hentai. I like yuri, and straight hentai. I like hentai mangas too! The ones that are on my manga list are ones I own, and the hentais that are on my anime list are ones I watched on different websites, so you could say I am a man of culture lol. Also I have a lot of animes I plan to watch, its just that the ones that are in my plan to watch are ones I really wanna watch. I also like to read hentai online too, and look at random hentai aswell.  Nonethelees this game made Vanilla my new waifu, I'd like to pat her head and her...
Very cute, recommend getting 18+ patch.
This is a visual novel about a wonderful world full of catgirl waifus, highly recommend.
NEKO NEKO NIIII
I've bought all the series and I've watched the anime which is really good
PET THE CAT GIRLS!!!!

This visual novel is a brilliant showcase of just how far humanity has gone off the rails.
This is my reason  for living.
I would no recommend as I am now a sex addict

A cat girl game made me cry. 10/10
If you like anime cat girls this is for you. I like the master servant bond between the protagonist and the girls. Some sexual interactions with the girls, it can get spicy.

Cats + Girls = This game
booba
The best of all
this is a very good game to play with your family
POSTED: JULY 22 This game saved my life.  I am 25.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you
fuccin cats n shid? hell yeah cat harem n shid? hell yeah
I love this fucking game. This is awesome!

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you
wow such cute and innocent cat girls i hope nothing NSFW happens to them
this is so people will get this game recommended to them on steam that are on my friends list
Press p for Jiggle physics <3
I do not regret this, but my family does regret me
Cute catgirls and nice CGs and music. Took about 2hrs to complete the novel from start to finish and get all of the achievements. Very easy to 100%.
This game made me cu-m in less than 5 minutes 10/10 would play again
BOOBS MUCH LIKE
10/10
cat girl tiddies
i watched the anime its close to the same and i really enjoy it
bought to see the 18+. replayed for the STORY, the amazing, incredible story! depth, humor, detailed and at times, emotional! i'm man enough to say some scenes made me teary-eyed due to being so attached to the characters.

Story - 0/5 Characters - 0/5 - too much sugar, no soul Atmosphere - 0/5  Nekopara is a light novel or visual novel, I don't really know what is this genre of vg called. Anyways... It may seem like a good purchase, because it seems cute and the characters move and make gestures when you are talking to them, but that is about everything you are going to get. The whole game consists of monotone clicking and reading what the flat and mostly annoying characters say (+ what you, the main guy, thinks). Game has no plot and you can prepare for the many anime harem cliches like a young boy living alone, being kind yet stupid to realize every single girl (including his own sis, maybe) is in love with him, hard and sad past of the girls, which is not that hard nor sad at all.   This game is telling you that you are going to get a lot of anime cuteness and a romantic story. But prepare to get none of those. Instead of that prepare for hours of boring reading what "you" think about your very little intligent girlfriends. (yap, polygamy with people with minds of a cat is actually legal in this game)  Some new harem animes thesedays at least try to focus on the true main characters (the girls) but this game does not do even that.  One plus to the voice actresses who actually represented the characters very good. (yet they were still very annoying)  I juts want to add, at the time of writing this I was a big anime fan... so this is not a hate on anime or japanese pop culture. This game is simply not good.
100% recommend you to play this game
God bless sayori and her work.
Hentai
It is an entertaining story, with lovely artwork and I appreciated the animated sprites for the characters during dialogue, but I didn't care for the censored romantic scenes between the characters. There was a rather comical amount of fluids and it looked like the girls had a toilet accident. Very much the opposite of attractive.
this game makes me horny af
It's pretty good, but where are all the cakes at?
i am so horny
Every weebs guilty pleasure.
Meow
Plain and simple. The best game to grace mankind.
I truly hope no one remembers this review.        Everyone's gone? Okay. Get the R18 patch and play it.
I love it
ive nutted over 25+ times today  no cap
Yes dad, I'm winning.

Just letting the world know I enjoyed this game
What am I doing with my life?

Cum alert
Nekopara is just one of those visual novels that every weeb needs to experience because it's so good! Quality waifus!
cat go meow
it consumes my life

yo epic game would cop just make sure your mom dosent walk in on you playing (got it for research purposes i swear).
good, cat
NEKOPARA, at first, I bought really just for the memes. Yeah, it's a visual novel that mainly has hentai in it, but if you really put that fact to the side, it's a really nice game to play with relatable characters. Overall, I don't hold any regrets aside from a few cringy lines that were said at lines.
dude
Poggers
This was the biggest load of shit i have ever played.  If you like you can hold CTRL and beat it in 3 minutes.  Bought all 4 in a steam sale pack and refunded after i played the first.  There is absolutely nothing here.   You have no decisions, choices, options to pick, any interaction, you cant even pick different phrases to say.  I just dont get the weeb shit where your so lonely that this fills some hole in your life.  Is it the story thats suppose to hold up this game?  Cause it doesnt.  Catgirls are FedExed to your chocolate shop, commence the banging of Catgirls.  That would be a great plot if you could actually interact with it.  But if im just buying some pictures I need great writing to go with it.  Dont understand overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The artwork is the only thing this game does right.  Just go watch it somewhere.
it is cool and good and im sorry mom
good
You think i didn't catch that Gurren Lagann reference game creators "her tail is stiff enough to pierce the Heavens" you get my up vote but just remember if you make another i will john wick your ass.
are y'all winning sons?
I came from the anime. I watched it dubbed from the Funimation website. I thought it was cute, so I decided to buy Nekopara Volume 1 because I was curious about the game that inspired the anime. The anime did not prepare me for what I saw in this game. Imagine my shock when I discovered that the game is a hentai. How could the anime be more family friendly while the game is so pornographic? Curiosity kills the cat, I suppose. Anyway, this was me when I was looking at the sex scenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZHufO9-Lp0
Beautiful graphic and the story known by everyone.
epic cat game
this is my second time buying this game  very good game the hole series
I dont know what I have to say, I see a neko game I play it.
funny cat girls make my weiner grow
what am i doing with my life
good game bro
:)
Mmm~   You know why i'm here~  〜(￣▽￣〜)
No. Cute girls, bad story.
Not a bad game, but I still want to die a bit

Workers at the bank probably get disappointed in me when they see $14:50 getting spent on steam.
nice nice this game will teach u how to puck you cat mmmmmmm  i dnt have cat
Oh this game looks pretty cool                                                                                                     Wait a second...
Nice.

super good

As for having only a small handful but very in-depth amount of gameplay hours, I can safely assure future buyers that this is indeed worth the price. I would also like to say that the DLC content for the game really gives it more flavor. The settings are great, multiple language and graphical options to choose from.   I would recommend this to everyone, as well as the DLC.
awesome
i lub anime tiddies!!!!
18+ patch used to be free on steam, sad pp times.
very cute and wholesome! though i got this weird glitch where the cat girls forcefully ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥♥ and shoved ♥♥♥♥ into my ♥♥♥♥♥♥. kinda awkward and hope this glitch gets patched, otherwise great game!
Horny.

yes very good actually
I love Hentai

The
funny cat game makes me go brrrrrrrrr

Solid
the cat girls are really cute and story is cute for base game without the R18 DLC make sure not to buy that dlc for your kids but the DLC is there for those who like the exstra scenes
During my time in Vietnam, this game provided me with nothing but pure horny. this game is in a word Luwud. My favorite aspect of this game is that it can be played with only 69 hands ;) I would highly recommend this game to anyone between the ages of 95-126 My favorite part is when (Sin)namon stumbles in her bidet  over all I would give this game a 420 out of 10 (one for every time I nutted while playing this game)
Hot cat girl go meow!!!
God might have abandoned me, but at least now i have cute 2D virtual cat girls
cat girls that 2 years old heheheheheehehehehehehehehehehehe ;) OH SHIZ THE POLICE NO GET OFF MENFEIFJPODksapkdaxz,

6/10
very good
haha funny cat girl go meow
Very cute cats, highly recommend
please make it stop 10/10
heehee neko go brrrr
playing with 1 hand btw
I have no regrets. As the final shred of dignity was shred, for I had spent 30$ for a collection of visual novels that would confirm my destiny as a person who would forever be alone. Not a woeful destiny however, as upon finishing the first novel I had realized that I had ascended beyond the mortal realm of comprehension. Everything became so clear, as I now was able to understand the world and all of its minute details to a level that I began to understand and not understand like a cat in a box. speaking of cats, the ones in this game are pretty cool i guess
you already know why everyone is here, cute catgirls that you can have relationship with virtually, the laughs and giggles and most importantly the [REDACTED] parts. All of them are 10/10
mmmmm he hee mmmm    kutuku the false god gave me this and i shall be smited by sunset
yeah this game series changed my life. this is some truly good stuff.
Plot - 7/10 Drawing - 9/10  Music - 8/10  Characters - 9/10  Hentai - 8/10
I enjoy, but i don't want to be horny, I want to be happy with a full uncensored.
cute cat girls? poggers!
I need serious help i have been playing this game for 4 days straight and my pp is hurting real bad. I think that i need to see a doctor pls send help. Update: i've seen a doctor, pp is fine thank god.

It's wacky, dumb, and *quite* sexy. It's a fun game if you're looking to forget about the structured nature of reality. Whether you're here for a nut or "the plot." You'll find yourself having a weird, innocent fun in this bizarre light-hearted experience. Warning though, shit gets wild, and very sexual. So if a bunch of weird catgirl maids doesn't sound like a good time, then be on your way. It's certainly not for everyone. But I had some of the most fun, yet strangest moments... and some nostalgia, of a much simpler time.
A whole new world.
If I wasn't on an FBI watchlist before, I definitely am now.  9.5/10
This game made me do the cummies hehe.
ITS NOT LIKE THE ANIME AVERT YOU EYES OH GOD ITS TO LATE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So nice the music was that it cured my depression
Loli Nekos
Plot: Just a simple sweet story, no revelations here. Art: Exquisite. All, starting with the character design, level of details up to the coloration is of a superb quality. Animation: It is one of a kind VN with such extensive animation and it is very well done. P.S. I wonder, if there will ever be made a visual novel with such fine visual design but with intereting and strong plot? Ah, fantasies...
Cat
Great story and content. It was fun to see the original work along with the anime
go buy the adult only content or you wont get the full experience
このゲームは本当にいいです！ それはいいので： -ねこぱら1巻には素晴らしい陰謀があります。 -Nekopara Volume 1にはR18コンテンツがあります。 -Nekopara Vol 1は（私のコンピューターのように）十分に速くないコンピューターで実行できます。 -ねこぱら1巻の声優（声優・女優）はすごい！彼らは素晴らしいです！ 買うべきですか？ あなたは本当にそれを買うべきです！後悔することはありません。このゲームについて聞いたとき、私は躊躇しませんでした。ネコパラ第0巻からネコパラ第3巻を購入するためにお金を節約しました。  This game is really nice! Why is it nice?  It is nice because: - Nekopara Vol 1 has great plot. - Nekopara Vol 1 has R18 Content. - Nekopara Vol 1 can be run on a computer that isn't fast enough (like my computer) - Nekopara Vol 1's seiyuus (voice actor/actress) are very great! They're fantastic!  Should you buy it or should you not? A: You really should buy it! You won't regret it. I did not hesitate when I heard about this game. I saved money to buy Nekopara Vol 0 to Nekopara Vol 3.
h
11/10 will nut again in front of my pet cats.
Cute catgirls, cute art, cute story, cute comedy and cute music, everything about this game is cute :3 Excited about seeing Cinnamon and the other catgirls getting more screentime, but Chocola, Vanilla and Shigure were lovely too.   2D for LyfE
unga bunga
its just fantastic
I like the art style very cool     i like the sex too  cats are cool
It's cute catgirls doing cute catgirl things. What's not to like?
Absolutely fantastic picture book. My 8 year old couldn't be more happy with it.
*clap clap clap* *cat noises* "now we make cakes"
my pee, it is glue
Nekopara vol 1 is very heartwarming and actually has some logical explanations for a few things in the story. I would recommend the hentai dlc to get the full experience of the story. i am now in love with cat girls 0_0 after finishing this.
I feel the need to be honest with this review.  This is an outstanding visual novel. The artwork is great, the story writing is near perfect, even the emotions that you are the reader develop for the characters is well planned. I really have nothing bad to say about this.   The adult DLC patch while yes adds the "kink" to the game however, with that in mind it really adds the love of the characters to one another. You understand their love for the main character as well as each other. The thought process, the development of feelings. While yes it is a adult visual novel this patch really adds to the story and one I thing should be bought along with the game.   It is truly a work of art and one that I think is understated and to be completely honest it is really missed in the Anime version. Enjoy the read, enjoy the characters, love the story. I am truly glad I gave this a chance.
Nya~
whats this white stuff everywhere on my pants
ass game, got boring after 3 hours
The best thing I play in my life XD
good
Absolutely no one's going to believe me when I say I played this for actual research purposes.  So, I'll say this instead: I played this for 'research' purposes. Didn't nut. Am a very big sad now.
If you love catgirls and want to support NekoWorks get this game, its a fun story great cast of catgirls.
Great plot
VERY VERY VERY NOICE
Absolute guilty pleasure. It's ridiculous how enjoyable this game is. It will make you genuinely smile.
I like to play this game whenever im drowning in sadness
I lost
A brilliant FPS game.

Catgirls
Look up 9 months in Cat Years
Okm
in this game...this place....this cursed land brought by this title.  there are no gods to save you from this place, no demons to take your life and relieve the pain of all this.  it's only you and these...young "girls" who like to mimic cats brought to you in these low quality boxes offered by the human trafficking service hired to bring them here.  but, why? why would someone "buy" these beings? looking at you with these...gigantic balls which don't resemble an eye at all, they look more like a demonic orb draining your soul every time you make contact with it.  and there are their voices.....so...high pitched in such a sharp tone it makes my ears almost bleed. what experience was it supposed to be? this game would fit perfectly as psychological terror.  it's been a week, i've played 6 minutes and i'm afraid to play it again because i still cannot surpass the trauma it gave me in such a small amount of time....i feel like i am dragged into the psychiatric hospital of outlast every time i open the game.  this thing is the perfect human psychological terror, no other game or terror experience can be as traumatic as this one, it goes deep into your mind disguised as friendly looking japanese cartoon characters but all they do is stare at you with these bottomless crystalline circles that were supposed to be eyes and take your humanity bit by bit.  it frightens me. how they look. the way they speak. what they do.  i do not want to play this anymore. but something in my subconscious tells me to come back.  maybe it's already too late for me. do not make the same mistake.
Worst game ev
10/10 Having this game in my library has brought shame to my family.
Pretty good. Pretty good
This game saved my life.  I am 27.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my "labor". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you.
poooooooooooog
nice game
Just overall great character design, a good few funny moments, and a few hard hitting emotional and heart  warming moments to top it all off.
this game is a blessing and  a curse.
Pretty good game recommended to me by Zach T. Cook and Ryan Kuri
Me like the cat lady with the jiggles and the such.
Haha cats go nyan nyan !!
Scariest psychological horror I have played. The sounds of nya have never left my head.
10/10 IGN
This is the epitome of culture
Vanilla has my heart
<: this game is good
I am a 48 years old middle aged man, I work in a small typical business company and I can say that I your average salary man. I am a virgin who once had a fiance (which was also planned by my family). But after seeing how much of a loser I was, she left me and whole family planning.     I never once hold a girl's han- No, even that would be considered high for me. I have never even made an eye contact with a girl. For me, women are complete aliens . I have a face that even a mother would feel pity about it. I used to get bullied everyday,every night because of the short height even dwarfs would mock, I have a pp that is even shorter than the nose of pinocio who never lied. I did make a tinder account to gain some confidence for talking with girls ,but it was latter banned by tinder themselves due to my hideous looks.            I thought my life was over. But then I stumbled upon this game, it look like some garbage only virgin would played, that's why it was perfect for me. So i thought to give it go. Little did i know. This game changed me. Now, I have become the pinnacle of success and alphaness ,a complete chad.         I am now 7 feet tall built like a complete tank. My pp? oh its size is same as my previous height. My confidence and ego has sky rocketed exceeding its limit. I make every female's panties drop the moment I make eye contact now. Because of my attractiveness I have become ceo of different companies and I am wealthy af. I did thought lets make another tinder account, but that was banned again because tinder thought it was bug of having many right swipes. I would like to end my story here now, and make sure, to keep your mother away from tiktok, orelse you will be meeting me as the new dad.
Best game on steam. You need to buy the 18+ DLCs in order to get the full experience if you know what I mean ;) 10/10
Vanilla best nekogirl
i regret playing this
Pretty short, pretty good, make sure to get the nsfw DLC for the optimal experience
Its a pretty nice visual novel . The character design is amazing and the story is enjoyable . A really nice game to introduce you to the genre .
Just a humble man owning a bakery with cat-girl waitresses. 10/10 would recommend!
Its a visual novel made with love
Best game ever IGN should rate it 10/10
Vanilla is immune to the p button!
Solidify your virginity and disappoint your parents harder with this purchase!
Dang, I've heard of owners being in love with their pets but this game takes that to an extreme I think the RSPCA would frown upon. That aside, adorable game with adorable cat girls. If you can get passed them being your... ehm, lovers, then you're guaranteed a cute, fluffy time! <3
kawaii overload.. 4-5h of reading so a real short VN but that is ok for the price.
Loved them H scenes boiiiiii..
There's not much to say a perfect game for weebs and degenerates alike, I am both so you can probably understand why I liked the game as much as I did.
best game I have ever played in a million years
I am starting to love Nekopara after playing through Volume 1 and really love the story. So far Vanilla is my favorite catgirl and following her is Chocola. Hopes to another great story in Volume 2!
Got gifted this game, stayed for the jiggle physics.
Nice Cat!!
I reject my dignity, JoJo!!
Nice game
One word: "Nya."
Great now I have a even more concerning fetish with cat girls  Whelp off to buy volume 2  speedrun %eny% 56:23:23
Nice stuff
"Ah, no! They carry p-pollen...! It's pollen, okay? Haaah... ♪"
Perfect
very good. not disapointed. sucks you have to buy the r18 dlc
the story line was hard to follow at first then got use to subtitles would recomend
Nekopara is really well made game and i enjoy playing ( or reading it ) I would recommend anyone who adores anime and catgirls *then this is definielty perfect game choice for you* + Chocola is so adorable
best game ever
who needs real girls amiright?
i got this game and its DLC as a joke, but i dont think its a joke anymore
The boys like vanilla they said and I agree.
are you lost babygirl????????
I like the cat facts, very informational
Chocola Khan is the greatest character to ever roam Outworld. She has conquered many cafe's and baths in her time as ruler. Although Vanilla is her sister, she has a big issue with chain smoking. That hole in her throat really doesn't help for much.
This game helps me find my FBI agent irl  10/10 must have
cat girl go nya. i just like women, man.
I would die for Chocola and Vanilla
I mean, its literally cats acting like cats except you´re the guy who should be in prison for a good chunk of years. Nonetheless, art is good but the game can be short but i mean...its a visual novel thats mostly about "fun" so it doesn´t need to be long.
holy  . ...  shit ...                           cat girl boobies ....
i wanna fuck vanilla fr doe
bad game
ive heard its and amazing game, and was enjoying it alot, but  then realized didnt have the 18+ patch, so ima save up for that first  before i play through all the games, really gave me the feels.     Also, Neko's
The best shooter game. 10/10
Lowkey didn't think this series was gonna be fun I'm kinda loving the storyline lol. I was tryna do it for the achievements and I'm loving the cat girls! chocola is best neko!  and remember! anime thighs save lives!
Childe's life is so perfect, you can do what you want, without worrying about time, not to mention money, there are always many beautiful girls around you.
yee
Sequel of Nekopara0, the story around Kashou and the 2 Catgirls evolve and there bonds deeepens even more. Meanwhile Main character Kashou cant imagine the backery without his 2 beloved catgirls. nce again heartwarming,adorable story. cute scenes, fully voiced and  enjoyable. Only to recommend!
Crab waifu when Also +18 patch more expensive than the game lol
when real catgirls will be a thing
great game, even without the extra 18+ content. (Though that is good too).
ew s*x
This game was recommended to me by a few friends so I decided to buy it and take a look, and honestly I'm glad I did. The story is interesting, the characters aren't bland with plenty of variety in personalities. And I found myself many times loving how adorable some of the characters got, yes this game does have it's lewd parts filling the fan service roll very well be if you brought the 18+ dlc or not. But the story is still nice as well, and honestly I haven't played many visual novels. But this is the first one I played where your character and his name are preset, and you don't really pick any dialogue choices at all you simply go along with the story. It's nice honestly though the option would have been nice to, however I didn't mind. Especially because the best part is the characters will constantly move when they speak or do something showing so much personality, it was refreshing to see so they were not just still images with a text box but actually looked like they had more life to them. I highly recommend this to anyone interested.  Side note for those who want to play it, here is a helpful tip: 3 achievements are set to the 3 types of languages that you set your text box language to, but they are accidentally not set to the right languages. You don't need to replay though the game to get these other language achievements simply set it to the language you want and start game, once you see the first text appear you will get the achievement then go to the main screen and change the language and repeat. English - gives you the "Play in Japanese" achievement Japanese - gives you the "Play in Chinese" achievement Chinese - gives you the "Play in English" achievement
I sinned but it was worth it.
very very gud
Its a good game.
yes because catgirls
I didn't get to see any anime tiddies.
I haven't played this game long enough to give it a proper review but so far it has been enjoyable.
Vanilla
One of the best horror games i've ever played! i was scared out of my mind while playing. i reccomend to people who want a good fright
`buy the dlc... its good
I understand the appeal of this game. 100%. I adore cat girls. I do have to admit I am disappointed that there is no actual interaction, it was literally just watching a visual novel. Most visual novels at least offer some dialogue choices, but not Nekopara; not that that's going to keep me from purchasing anymore games >//<
very good for many reasons
A gaming masterpiece. Would recommend for anyone.
The first half is fun and charming, that is until the sexual content begin. I would not recommend this game due to themes of incest.   [spoiler]I was not prepared for incestous content. The protagonist's sister being interested in the protagonist, the cats Chocolate and Vanilla being referred to both as daughters and lovers. There are more things I'd object to in this game, which is a damn shame because it starts out as a cutesy visual novel.[/spoiler]
Since this game absolutely refused to get off of the list of games Steam was recommending to me, I decided to check it out to see if it actually lived up to all the hype. I mean, a game cant get this popular and ubiquitous without having some merit besides cheesecake, right? I quite enjoyed Senran Kagura, after all.  The story starts in the absolute worst possible place, acting like it's at the end of some other VN's common route with all the emotional payoff for scenes and relationships that have not happened. Starting the game a little earlier in the timeline would've given us some time to get to grips with the characters before trying to guilt trip us for no reason, and starting the game a little bit later would've been much more beneficial to the lighthearted fluffy tone the game obviously wants us to have. Instead, we start right in the middle where not only are character relationships not established, but we have to cram in all of the worldbuilding that explains what catgirls are doing here into two paragraphs that honestly generates more plotholes than answers. And most of the dialogue since then is just seeing one-note characters continuing to be one-note repeatedly.  If you want something cute and funny to enjoy yourself with, go pick up a Yuzusoft game or something. Yeah, the sprites may not have fancy mouth and breathing animations like Nekopara, but a yuzusoft game will give you a much better UI that doesn't lag on every animation, more solid character personalities to identify with, a story that doesn't try to guilt trip the player 5 minutes in, and the achievements aren't so broken that none of the game language settings give you the right achievement (seriously, Starting the game in chinese gives you the achievement for starting in English. Nekopara is a 6 years old VN. how is that glitch not fixed?)  Also, Chocola barely refers to herself in the third person in the voice lines, but the subtitles absolutely insist on shoehorning her name into as many of her lines as possible regardless...which makes it even more noticeable when they randomly let first person pronouns slip through. It's bad enough when translators force every sentence to follow that speech quirk in every line that it happens regardless of how awkward it is in English. It's ten times worse when they decide to do it MORE than the Japanese lines to.
Its changed my life for the better. Would be called Onii-chan again
Super wholesome with a good story. Noice scenes, and is very revolutionary with the chest bouncyness.
✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* best game ever *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧
Houston... We have nooo problems.
This is story about man's cat. He helps his cats when they have problems. He teaches us how to take care cats as a pet. However, the game is so immersive that I need to rest after some checkpoints.
I have brought shame to my ancestors
You should buy the other DLC, its so good

yes
Very good
I need to be cleansed but still 10/10 game.
Best in the series. The Shrek of video games. #TeamChocola
Wholesome & Pure! 10/10 Made me want to become a catgirl =^-^=
It would be better if I didn't finish before the game
Very nice
Slightly different from the anime but great nevertheless
Small neko titties
I had to mute this game cause Chocola was annoying me so much :// Anyways chocola still annoying and Vanilla still boring af. good story not my typeofneko.
just fucking kill me please
cats girls go BRR BRRR BRRRRRR HISSSS    9.99-10
Alright, I mean come on. Its Catgirls. What more could you ask for?
This is the best game I have ever played. The story and deep-lore is sublime, the art is wonderful, and the character arcs are incredibly well written. I don't often give out the title of essential, but the quality of this piece is beyond comprehension. You're doing yourself a disservice if you choose to skip on this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
there is no hope, i already gave up      ...but my catgirls will always comfort me
kittys with tittys
all Catgirls best Catgirl
Seeing Chocola Come out of the box brought me joy and just made me smile for some reason.
Hardcore fps game with cat
CHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLA CHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLA CHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLACHOCOLAVANILLA
The drawing and animation is insanely good, (probably the best I have seen in a game), as is the voice acting.   However I do have 2 big gripes with it. I don't like reading subtitles when the game really is all about the visuals...It is a shame taking your eyes off of all the very well done body language just to read text. If I spoke fluent japanese, this would not be a con. The other con is that, I expected there to be some  (ANY AT ALL!) level of choice in this 'game'. You just click the text box, and it opens the next text box. If there are no choices in a 'game' like this, what exactly is the difference between this and a softcore hentai movie? I take issue with anything sold on steam where you have zero input on what happens. Classifying it as an indie game is bad.
clicking through this visual novel was like climbing a giant garbage heap on a large, seemingly never-ending landfill, just to find more garbage. 3 hours of unengaging pedo stuff. if that sounds good to you, play it.
Moe ;3
yes
"No officer, she's legal. I didn't hit her. I did not."  The game in a nutshell.
Bruh
damn might i say this game was some experience those cheeky cat girls gave me the run around ill tell you that but i made sure to keep them in check the dialogue was superb when i held enter i felt the power of the story and not even mentioning the sex scenes where i saw the cats tits gosh i felt the fire inside me when the same sound effect played on repeat for 20 minutes great job this game had me smiling the entire time good job
No words needed
yes.
im currently being held hostage in south sudan. pls help, this is not a joke!!!
easy badges and achivments !
jiggly boobies goes brrrr
If you know you know
The characters are cute, but kinda gross with the incest and the one guy with 'brotherly/owner love'
played this game all the way back in 2014 on a pirated copy because I didn't have enough money at the time.  this game was the reason why i  got into anime, so it makes me feel nostalgic. the characters are adorable and the H-scenes are among the best in the Eroge scene I've seen until now in terms of quality and animations. I now own the entire Nekopara series + DLC.   thank you, NekoWorks, for getting me into anime the correct way.  [spoiler]plus: Vanilla best girl.[/spoiler]
I will recommend this game for an anime boiz-crew, actually, I am one of them :) This game is so great and cool. There are cute animation and relaxing sounds. I want to play in it more and more xdd
Meow
Hey kid listen, I don't have much time.. This game was funded by Elon Mu-
cat girls go nya alot
anime tiddies
As the introductory story of the Nekopara Series, this was one of the most adorable and wholesome Visual novels so far that I've come across.   You follow the story of the MC whom has left his home, starting his own patisserie when he suddenly receives a delivery. Two cute cat girls in boxes whom have followed him from his home!  It's a simple yet adorable and enchanting story that fills you with happiness with the MC living his life with his two cat girls and taking care of his patisserie store. In addition to that, the characters are 2D Animated which adds even if the slightest to some a different kind of depth that makes the characters feel alive on top of their voiced characters.

hrgnh cat girl go meow
nice
good game
recommeded for neko lovers
HELP
Hot damn, that's the best way to describe this masterpiece. Buy the x-rated dlc or else you won't really be playing the game, just living a lie. A hollow shell of what could be. Even without H-scenes I'm sure the game is still enjoyable and adorable. Come and weeb out with the most kawaii of catgirls.
It's cat girl hentai I mean how can you go wrong
bouncing cat tiddy
im fucked
Yes.
uh based
ok
Kitten addiction
I really enjoy the romance and the small story between the owner and his cat girls. Yes it has its +18 scenes but that is not the only reason why this visual novel is so good. The voice acting and settings all mix in together very well and I will be playing rest of the novels for that.  Really a 10/10
i like how you can play the game with one hand
I buy NEKOPARA Vol.0,1,2,3
the jiggle function and bath scenes made it worth the money
play it and you'll understand, fucking degen<3
My parents kicked me out of the house for having sex with the cat
epicest game, best with dlc
once you download the 18+ content, the replayability increases 10-fold
5 hours of plot and 12 hours of more "plot"
If one of my folks ever sees me playing this game at this age, I'd be rightfully disowned. Worth the risk though.
pretty fun but if you want to access the hentai scenes you'll need to download some files or shit off the internet. It's pretty simple if you search up a youtube video, I'm just terrible with computers.
After playing this, I really want to be isekai'd full of nekomimi!!! Chocola-chan and Vanilla-chan so cute ❤❤❤
best cat simulator of all time totally worth it
Forgive me Lord I've sinned
mmmm yes, catgirl.... mmmnnmmmm yummy.
haha pp go brr
dude, catgirls
just, yes
lord forgive me for what I have done
In a world where Hitler and the axis powers won WWII, and the Nazis began research on a human-cat hybrid to replace the enslaved jewish workforce, a man recruits the work of 6 young genetically bred catgirls from the slums to serve his personal needs; ranging from menial labor in his shop to child prostitution. It is in his house where the catgirls are conditioned from birth to provide sexual pleasure to their master. Littered throughout the story are historical allusions to the Nazis and their final solution, especially the star of david required to be worn by all Jews, which is alluded to via the bell worn around the necks of all catgirls, which allows them to walk the streets freely and to work jobs. Similarly, the catgirls are treated only as property, no different from the Africans of the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th and 19th centuries. They are given practically no education, and mature quicker than normal humans, meaning that although they appear to be 14 to 18 years of age, they are in reality only around 1 to 2 years old. The only joy of which they are able to have is given through either being fed a strict ration of fish or providing sexual pleasure to themselves or others, playing out their depraved sexual fantasies. Overall, the story is both interesting and deeply depressing, and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys reading about these kinds of Orwellian alternate realities.
haveyouacceptedjesusasyourpersonalsavoir?
its nice
Should you buy this? YES. Why? It's got Catgirls.
haha catgirls go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
You'll know if someone is single if they have this game in their Steam profile
lewd
i bought this for the backgrounds i swear plz dont hurt me
I enjoyed it. Thought it was quite adorable and I let out a laugh here and there. There's a lot of joke reviews on here on the... lets just call it 'culture', but ignoring all that it's a pretty wholesome visual novel. If you're worried about the culture side of things there is a separate adult patch for that if you're uninterested in that kind of stuff or don't like it. There are some sexual lines however so be wary of that.
I BELIEVE IN CHOCOLA SUPREMACY
very good game. must buy with dlc. very nice. yes. nice. good. delicious.
pack 18+ phải mua riêng >:(
I didn't know i would enjoy fking the shit outta my pet cats so much 10/10 only true degenerates can understand this art form
The story is pretty good, also those bouncy bobs (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
pee pee big
owo
I watched the anime Nekopara and its OVA this year and liked them both.  I never really considered buying the VNs on steam but after seeing the Summer Sale prices, I changed my mind. I am really glad that I made this decision.  Nekopara happens to be the second Visual Novel that I have played (The first VN I played was DDLC) and I have had a really decent experience.  The OVA is based on the Vol.1 however since it's only 55 minutes long, it doesn't cover up everything like this VN did.  The characters are all really amazing in such a way that they would keep you engaged with the VN.  The music is fun to listen to and the art style is soothing as well.  I never thought that I would ever give Visual Novels a go but after playing this, I have realised how amazing they are and I am definitely looking forward to play more.  I completed the first Volume and now I'll get started with the next one.  If you are a fan of Visual Novels, then I'd definitely recommend you this.
Finish what I started it almost killed me
Local baker fuck his cats  yeah it's cool
yes
10/10
very nice, very riviting gaming experience
Good nekos would recommend
I bought this game as a joke but it turns out its good and cute
forgive me lord, for i have sinned.
Cat girl go Nyah Nyah  Weeb go on FBI watchlist
It's cute and has some nakedness (assuming you purchase the uncensoring DLC sigh).  The H scene are just a couple of pictures and very basic animations, only a couple of them toward the end, so don't expect a fullon sex show.  The only negative thing, are the noises in the game, like slurping and during sex. I'm not sure why Japanese have such a fascination with slurping noises during sex, it's overly exaggerated, and gross, and in this game, it's in a loop for a vast majority of the scene, so get ready to cut the sound off, because it's just horrible during the scenes, you've been warned :)
cat
Nah
who the fuck needs real women
i kid you not i did Nekopara for a book review assessment once to weed out the weebs in my class. i got a A- for the assessment
catgirls > real girls
bruh

My most expensive nut so far
Guy just wanted to live alone and run his own bakery :(  PS. Chocola <3
I even learned a bit of japanese words with this. TOTALLY A MUST HAVE Nekos for life
Woah what an amazing game! 10/10
it has a little something for everyone
I'm not always a cat person but when I am. I choose the one that makes my hips shiver. 10 out 10. Hips would shiver again.
I dunno what went through my brain when I bought this lulw. Top kek
really makes you feel like batman

This is so awesome, so many much tits and ass, bug cat girl and small one too, please buy it was so much good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've lost my sanity to this... And my friends too
Nekopara is a masterpiece in the way that it uses conventional story telling strategies to convey an amazingly crafted story. I've invested vast amounts of time into the game, in order to 100% complete it. Now it is my goal as a pillar in the nekopara community to 100% complete the quadrilogy in efforts to appease the forces of the heavens. All I can hope for is that my future consists of only anime women with cat ears.
Better than spending time with real people
nice game
A game of True Culture

Thanks to the homies for these cutie anime cat grills
Nice FPS game
weebs
Are Ya Winning, Son?
With the sale going on, there's no time like the present to enter the world of slice-of-life catgirls, or something a bit more interesting if you swear that you're the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction. The 18+ patch is on sale, too! Or whatever, who cares, do what you want, it's all good!
Firstly, let me say this game is a masterpiece, its a truly beautiful visual novel with characters you'll love, the story is SO, SO great, the graphics are PHENOMENAL and my god, the... the story... its about catgirls and you do things with catgirls, and... my i absolutely loved the story... anyways, i recommend taking breaks every once in a while since the game tends to fatigue the right arm whenever played, i greatly recommend getting hand soap and tissues, partially to clean yourself of the degeneracy filth and partially to enjoy the game to its fullest experience.  A few last things to point out if my review hasnt yet gotten you to buy this masterpiece,  1.) Badonkadonk bounciness slider 2.) CUTE CATGIRLS 3.) AMAZING 3D CONSOLE GRAPHICS  Really, get it today, amazing game...
10/10
Its fine, dont approve of the fact that they're lolis but sure. traps rule.
I came
Gf left me 10/10 1-handed Speedrun Accessible 10/10 Need to get rest of the games to feel fully immersed Needs VR support then no-handed mode achieved
It has cats, and they are girls. What is there not to like?
I'm addicted to Catgirl Coochie.
Love it!
If you don't buy the 18+ dlc you're missing out
i really need to see a real woman
Best played while listening to Dethklok
Visuals are pretty good and the characters are interesting enough.  Mostly just an eroge so know what to expect when you buy it.
I played this for the badges, I swear.
no nudity, big sad. chocola best girl tho
its lowkey kinda epic
fun "game". though i kinda wish there were actual  moments you can make decisions
this game was very nice. I like the cats
A fun straight laced Visual Novel with no choices and no multiple endings, which is fine with this VN. Graphics are clean and the music suits this Visual Novel well. The characters are all well crafted and their varying traits and characteristics create a sense of unique's to each of the characters. I enjoy a good straight up VN from time to time and this one was no exception. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys VN's or even someone that is new to the niche of Visual Novels.
Great game, should add anti aliasing as an option as well as resolution
VERY
God I love cats
Just finished the game.. Honestly, this game is amazing,even without the adult scene the story was excellent as well. The ending was very heartwarming and solid. I never expect this much from a visual novel game. Definitely worth the buy
sex
yeh this is good
yep

nice
its catgirls. you know why your here
Really  REALLY liked this game
I am a frequent (((ab)))user of this game.
truly a masterpiece
All in all, great game, nearly completed it and it has such wholesome scenes, in addition to all the lewd stuff. My only issue is that I can't unlock the play it in english achievement, despite playing the entire game in english, and it burns my soul not being able to 100%. If some dev could respond, however unlikely it is, with a solution, I'd much appreciate it.

epic
I came for the catgirl sex.  I stayed for the story.  10/10 would adopt a pair of catgirls againyan.
My parents refuse to talk with me. 10/10
I kept hearing about this game from degenerates and weebs. After I bought the base version, the R18 patch, and a bucket of lube, I knew that I was ready.  The game is interesting. The characters are cute and the H-scenes were nutable(repetitive and a little bland), but I'm not sure about how I feel about cat girls and their status in the game. Sapient being that are capable of displaying intelligence and emotions similar to human being kept in a state of constant servitude is a little disturbing. Being able to buy and sell them is pretty dark. The fact that there seems to be an cat girl abandonment/ abuse problem that is casually glossed over makes me think that the cutesy stuff that we see may not represent the experience of most cat girls. Our MC looks like he comes from a fairly privileged background and that his cat girls benefit from that. The novel doesn't really go into how their society accepted this or justified it.   The MC and the cat girls will often say that cat girls do 'x'(submissive, wanting the attention of humans, pleasing their owners, needing guys to hit them with that meat stick, and etc.) because it's in their nature, but that doesn't appear to be true. There seems to be a cat girl homelessness and crime problem that's happening. The police prowl the streets looking for cat girls who haven't had their wills and sense of pride broken.   We could very well be jerking it to a dystopian story where cat girls are brainwashed and put into slavery, while the ones that haven't are being severely oppressed by the humans.
The premise made me cringe, but the story is cute and very much enjoyable. Artworks have high quality, while being slightly repetitive. Overall a very enjoyable experience. Given, some of the h-scenes are somewhat objectionable...
Nekopara in a nutshell: grown man bakes and chills with technically one-yearish-old cat girls who he considers daughters but totally definitely won't bang. Probably. Maybe.  [i]*looks at dlc*[/i] ...dammit  (also there is much nyaaaa~~ to be had)
This is hte ebest i gam  i want 5hounrderd Houres
Nut Vol. 1
You know it's weird my family refuses to talk to me after finding out I play this but hey jokes on them now I can play this game out loud on speakers.
Shit is bad, japanese woman screaming from the start to finish, if this is your kink, you'll love it. Also, this is the "censored" version, even for this low price, i don't recommend.
haha cat tiddy go brrrrrrr
Game is fun, cat women seem OK, i play for a while went to play again and the game didnt save cannot recommend due to lack of autosave.
yes fun
I can't read.
RERO RERO RERO RERO RERO RERO RERO RERO LOLOLLOLOLOLLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLO IMPOSSIBLE NO ONE CAN JUST DEFLECT THE EMERALD SPLASH
I am just in love with the affection i get from these girls. I dont care if they are real because the love i have for them is. asides the point here's my review:  Kashou Minaduki is a young man with a dream. Throughout his life he’s loved baking but had to do so in private, away from the disapproving eyes of his family. One day this becomes too much to bear and Kashou suddenly moves out to finally run a brand new bakery, La Soleil. Much to his surprise, however, the nearly empty bakery has two huge shipping boxes inside – and out pop two catgirls! NEKOPARA Vol. 1 begins with an incredibly goofy anime-style bang and continues in that humorous way. You might be surprised to find, however, that there’s more to this visual novel than simple goofball antics.  What’s the deal with these catgirls? In the world of NEKOPARA there’s absolutely nothing strange about it. Apparently, catgirls live among humans normally and are often taken up as pets, workers, or romantic partners. Whatever relationships humans have with their catgirls are plainly accepted, although the protagonist seems to have a problem accepting this all as commonplace. Although they look so much like humans they still have many cat traits such as pawing madly at cat toys or drooling over fish and catnip. It’s an incredibly odd thing to consider from the get go but it almost becomes “normal” by the end of Vol. 1.  The misadventures between Kashou and his two sudden catgirl staff members, Chocola and Vanilla, start off as pretty average. Here is a guy who was fully prepared to strike out on his own when suddenly two of the family pets show up! As readers see them all interact it’s hard to not see how positive and enjoyable their presence is. In any case, the story progresses and issues grow more complicated about halfway through. Even though this is the first of a possible series of visual novels, it also ends on a high note. This is much better than the cliffhangers other titles are apt to use.  Visual novels may not require stunning graphics to be enjoyable, but all the same this one has some seriously engaging art. Of course there’s the flashy anime artwork for each character but there’s even more at play. What can’t be conveyed via screenshots A so called “E-mote” system animates each character in a lively fashion. In fact, it looks about as close as you can get to actually watching an anime series in a visual novel without going full out with animated sequences. Sometimes this does look weird though because this huge focus on E-mote means the girls are wiggling about as if they have to pee. Perhaps that’s all supposed to be cute but it comes off as distracting.
i give this 8 out of 10 faps
Honestly the whole series is amazing, with the edition of the R18+ as well..its currently No.1 on my list. its my favorite kinda wholesome...degenerate wholesome (-insert smug megu here-)
it nice
I honestly loved this game and plan on getting the other volumes for the game and watching the anime I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes anime 10/10
I am sooooo going to hell
yeet
Epic game got all my needs out of this 10/10 would purchase again
This game is super pay to win.
vanilla is the best girl
Why are there only catgirls? Where are the catboys? Catgirls can't reproduce with humans so where are they all coming from? Are they still being genetically engineered? Is this otherworldly society forcing feline genetic material into human women to create these monsters?  9/10 The writing is fantastic and Vanilla is best girl.
I heard that everybody who played that game became a CHAD
well spent hours of my life (can't say my family would say the same)
Cute cats
This game is beautiful but don't expect any decision making, it's just a visual novel
Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals
Nekopara volume 1, the next one to review in the saga.. I absolutely loved this game, now this might be a bit of bias and all, but i'm a Chocola kind of guy so seeing her do "lewd" things was pretty damn good. Minus the hentai, it was a really fun story, Chocola and Vanilla come in a box and Kashou-sama doesn't accept them. Most of the story is them trying to gain his trust by doing work for him, coming clean with their feelings, doing "funny" things in bed, and of course lots of purring and nyaing in between. Overall this game had a hugely fleshed out story, no offense to volume 0 or Extra or anything, but they didn't have chapters. This game took me 2 hours to absorb the sheer amount of story and cuteness. Buy it if you're into females creatures with feline features!
Do it for Chocola! (or Vanilla if you prefer her) And for Live2D. It's pretty solid wholsome-erotic adventure, so you can't go wrong with it if you're into visual novels!
Why this isn't a GOTY?
Deep lore to rival the Souls series, thrilling plotlines to rival the Last of Us, gameplay to rival DOOM Eternal, graphics to rival what we've seen of Cyberpunk 2077. An absolute MASTERCLASS in videogame making and history.
Not enough anime big tittie bitches
Nice
This Novel is most likely one of the best ones i have ever experienced. I wish i could forget i played it to experience it again. It is truly a masterpiece and deserves a 10/10. I hope for a sequel to this amazing VN.  Pros: -Character personality -Voice acting -Animations when talking/acting/etc -Story line/Plot -Length - E-mote system - R-18 Scenes (lol)  Cons -Devoid of any choices whatsoever (I'll think of more when i get to it)  Overall -Great and amazing VN for it's current price, and if you like Virtual Novels, Then i highly recommend you buy Nekopara.  10/10
nut blast fbi
very good game
bruh
Vol 1 is dedicated to Kashou, Chocola and Vanilla. Free 18+ patch is not hard to find.  - If you haven't tried Vol 0, try it first as it's cheaper and will get you used to the characters. - If you played Vol 0 already and considering buying Vol 1, you are a cheeky stingy twat because you hesitate. - If you already settled on buying Vol 1, get ready to disappoint your parents not once, but [b]twice[/b] again because you will go for Vol 2 and then 3 as well.  10/10. All aboard the nekogirl train ladies and degenerates.
good game, loved it
i love this game

Catgirls! Need I say more?
Yes.
This is a great and wonderful game. It is fun and simple, if you like anime and cute neko girls then this is the perfect game. It is a fun story that is great when you just want something to relax to. I bought this game on a whim and I am surprised just how much I enjoyed it. It also had quite the funny moments in it that got me to laugh pretty hard. This is a well made game that is worth the price and I am excited to play all the other Neko Para games.
YEP COCK
MY MUMMY SAW AN BAN ME FRUM COMPUPER!!!!!!!!
pooped
Good, but not haram bro.
finally I can fuck my nekos
yo. yo YOOOO!!!!
Very interesting game. 4/5
bought this for my kid ,he rly liked it
One of my favorite franchise  If you like catgirls  IE: (Neko)  This is a Game  series you will enjoy.
Finally a reason not to eat my cat!
This is not a game. It is a animated story with voice acting. The only difference between this and anime is the fact that you have to click to progress the story.
basically cat girl land and it has a long story line. worth the 7 pounds for us degens
definitely worth it if your a fan of cat girls.
Better watch anime or buy when it's discounted.
I play so much fun !!!
A wonderful wholesome time hanging out with cute catgirls. dlc recomended.

Hey, hey master. What's men-stroo-al pain? OwO
Only people with very high IQ play this game.
Best Game to escape the reality where I am too lazy to get a girlfriend in my high-school life.
This game have "Chest Bounciness" slider, what makes me happy <3 Game is amazing, can anyone make catgirls real? I need Vanilla or Azuki in my life.
ganga gang gfang
My penis - Thanks m8
Mutant Cat and Woman mixed. Pretty good game.
This game doesn't even give you the option to choose anything for at least 3 hours! Some dating sim this is where you can't pursue different routes! Plus they censored all the inappropriate parts, which I think detracts from the game's value. Cute girls give this a 3 out of 10.
It is not shameful to enjoy watching cute cat girls, even in these types of scenes...I say as my mom walks in, unplugs computer, and then chucks out the window. 10/10 would buy another computer and play again.
Great game, I came 3 times in the span of 3 minutes <3
ของโคตรดีย์( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
v furry
oh lord forgive me for i have sinned these were not just cute neko maids
My first VN and I think I choose one of the best games to start. would recommend, would support, would protc, but won't lewd sorry.
This CANNOT be legal
first, let me express my love for this game. The b00bies, the artstyle, the catgirls, the ears, the maid outfits are all masterfully made by Nekoworks, and I'm surprised they haven't recieved trillions in funding yet. There were times were i was suicidal and depressed, standing at the edge of my building when a hand reached out to me. That hand was of Vanilla, the best catgirl in the series. Her fluffy white ears and tail was what stopped me from commitng suicide. This series has brought so much joy and spark to my life i cannot describe. The moment i saw the franchise on steam for sale for 70% off, i cried tears of joy. When my eyes met with the beautiful "400 hkd" price tag, i nearly creamed my panties. There were literal times where i had a blade to my wrist, when the familliar sound "nyaa~" brought me back to my senses. The comprehensive storytelling and love between the catgirls and MC is simply amazing. If there was a way to reset my memories, I would have done so a million times.         next, lets focus less on my personal issues and talk more about the game itself. Nekopara is a series of adult visual novels developed by Neko Works and published by Sekai Project. The first game in the series, Nekopara Vol. 1, was released on December 30, 2014. The series is set in a world where humans live alongside catgirls, known as "Nekos" It is a mastepiece. Catgirls, also known as Nekos (ネコ, cat in Japanese), are an intelligent species of cat-human hybrids that live alongside humans in the Nekopara universe. Catgirls physically resemble humans with feline ears the same color as their hair , slitted pupils, a tail, and a cat-like mouth. Catgirls were once left homeless and living in the streets, but now they are domesticated by humans and aren't allowed to go anywhere by themselves without their masters unless they have a bell. All main catgirls are here as follows.      Chocola - The youngest (together with Vanilla) of the nekos and is Vanilla's biological twin. She has developed a close attachment to Kashou and couldn't bear to be separated from him. Her cat breed is unknown.      Vanilla - Chocola's biological twin and has a very close relationship with her. Vanilla rarely expresses her true emotions and has a kūdere-type and stoic personality. Her cat breed is unknown.      Azuki - Eldest and shortest of the Minazuki's nekos. She has a mischievous and energetic personality and oftenly picks fights with the others. She is a Munchkin Cat.      Maple - The second eldest of the nekos. She is well-informed about technology and enjoys visiting various shops and restaurants to try different foods and drinks. She is an American Curl.      Cinnamon - The third youngest of the nekos. She often interprets and expresses everything in a sexual manner, resulting her to be aroused. She has a very perverted personality. She is a Scottish Fold.      Coconut - The second youngest of the nekos. She possesses a very womanly body though she isn't confident about this and instead, yearns to be called cute. She has a cool personality according to the others. She also appears to have very low self-esteem, and tends to think about things such as suicide when she fails to do something or doesn't meet the standards of others. She is a Maine Coon.      Milk (also known as Food Stand Cat) - A catgirl who manages a takoyaki food stand situated in the park where Kashou, Chocola and Vanilla often visit at during their break hours. She has a similar personality with Chocola, being cheerful and friendly even to new acquaintances. Her cat breed is unknown.   The game series are here as follows: (for fans of the franchise)  Nekopara vol. 0  Nekopara vol. 1  Nekopara vol. 2  Nekopalive (VR supported)  Nekopara vol. 3  Nekopara OVA  Nekopara OVA extra  Nekopara EXTRA  Nekoworks is able to create a coheasive and heartwarming plot and storyline to warm our hearts with these adorable catgirls. Every single thing they do in this game gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling. Everything in this game is perfect, from the catgirls going in heat to the bath scene is all beautifully coreagraphed, with love from Nekoworks. Recently the anime has been released (its nekopara Vol.1) and is a braeutiful, heartwarming callback to my original playthrough of this game. When i finished playing, the only thing that was left was a mixture of my tears and semen. I originally got this game to enjoy myself, stroke the pencil, let the one eyed snake loose, jacking off, masturbating, fapping, bash the bishop, beat it, choke the chicken, punish percy, polish the family jewels, slap the salami, wank it, wax the carrot, wax the dolphin, punch the clown, self abuse, cook up a batch, crack one off, frig, pet (one's) kitty, play with (ones self), drop the kids off at the pool, beat the meat, yank it, fuck your hand or pudwhack. However, halfway through the playthough with my hand on my p3nis, i started crying. The story was simply so moving and emotional that i had to wipe both my tears and ejaculate at the same time. The only issue i had with this game was no traps.  In conclusion; get the game if you want an amazing storyline and beautiful visuals. Or if you want to masturbate. Just get it.

hehee big bungos and h,,,honkers. 10/1
i love this game :D
yes
made me nut in the first 10 minutes, highly recommend  edit: apparently this vn is supposed to be 6 hours long or so i have 20 hours
A very heartwarming and adorable story. The game runs about 4 hours if you have the 18+ DLC. It was a very nice read and I look forward to coming back to it sometime soon in the future. I highly recommend it to others and it's a family friendly game if you don't have the DLC, save for a bit of fanservice.
yes very good anime  girl
Makes pp hard and pee white.
I'm disappointed  in myself... ;-;
its okay i guess
It has cat, it has tummies. It panders to the weebs fandom. They know their market well. 10/10, would shake the screen again
It's obvious. Get the game. Who doesn't like catgirls?
I love neko lolis
good
What can I say but wow. There is a small story as to why this game ended up on my account. You see, I would tend to help friends in various games to help them level, earn rewards, etc. They naturally asked if I wanted any compensation for my efforts. And I would always jokingly respond that the best form of payment is in Nekopara. This “joke” turned into what is now my complete devotion to the characters, world and 18+ patch when one of my friends actually went ahead and got one of the games for me. Now it is easy to explain why I love this series, and yes, a Lenny face is very fitting. This Visual Novel, which make no mistake, is all it is. Puts you in the shoes of a pastry, sweet and cake maker, etc. Who has recently moved out of home to set up a café business. However, upon unpacking his possession finds that two of the boxes contain two of his cat girls, who managed to stow themselves away so they could stay with him. What follows is a cute story of him coming to terms with them wanting to stick with him and the cat girls development as employees of the business…… and other “developments” if you catch my drift. Yes, these cats are not left untouched for very long, and it very quickly sheds it’s somewhat innocent image in exchange for what is the purest, sweetest vanilla fun times that you could ask to come across. Sure, the story has zero interaction, sure the animations aren’t crazy, sure some scenes stagnate when you are reading miles of text. But it just doesn’t matter. Because this is Nekopara. This is the epitome of cat girls. I will come back for the story once and for the real “plot” a hundred times more. I wear my Nekopara badges, wallpapers and achievements with pride. This review will forever be left here, as a sign of pride. Godspeed Neko Works, Godspeed. 10/10
Cute cat girls with a good deal of fan service. Recommended.
Epic! While story is nothing spectacular, character presentation, H-scene and petting system are UNIQUE. I wonder why there is no spin-off just dedicating on petting and interaction...
big cat girl boobs go bounce hahaha hehehe  This masterpiece is the Mona Lisa of the gaming/light novel industry and is an absolutely vital necessity in anyones gaming career. The gameplay is extremely gripping and rivals that of Last of Us and The walking dead. RTX is a must with this game as it entirely changes the intense and heartbreaking gameplay and makes it look even more like the gem it is.  20/10, will be buying the next volume straight after i finish wanking.
please make it a reality Elon-chan
god i wish they were real
you will never look at your cat the same way ever again
I have no clue what happens during this game, I just clicked through until I got to the part where I fuck the cat girls
God Bless you
Really cute and a great 18+ version ;)
nekopara is just perfict i cant say any thing, it took me  9 hours to finish the  game for its price i will say its worth it one bad thing is for r-18 you need to install a r-18 patch it does not take much time to get it all set but still i did not know about it and had to play the game again.
Very epic. Elon Musk should use this as reference for his catgirl research.
God gave his powers to a man for one day, and this man created a masterpeace that is this game. 11/10 - No regrets on buying this and the extras ;)
the artist for this game needs to get paid more
It's a cute little visual novel about catgirls. What more could you ask for? It's also a good way to pass the time in my opinion.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbyea
cute girls
I am a lonely man.. and this game makes me feel a little better.
Fuck, overshot by 1 hour.
i got this new anime game. basically there's this catgirl except she's got huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big ol' tonhongerekoogers. what happens next?! her twin catgirl sister shows up with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. humongous hungolomghononoloughongous.
I think I reached nirvana with this game.  -cuteness ✔ -neko ears and tails ✔ -funny and heartwarming story ✔ -BOUNCE ✔✔✔✔✔✔✔
epic.
quality
fucking cat girls
yes
Love this game. Catgirls n cute voice uwu
High quality production, a good start for anyone new with VN, though the story is nothing fancy and impressive in the world of VN.
10/10 Tiddy bounce slider
It was a cute experience. The lewd scenes were actually good. However the second one stays the best for me. Since the last one... it was damn long 0.o Anyway! Voice acting, writing and the art were all amazing! I really liked it ^w^
I cried a lot
After playing this game for an accumulative minute. I died.  Because I now realize.  I have a [b]Massive Catgirl Fetish.[/b]
NEKOPARA Vol.1 is a very cute and but long game compaired to NEKOPARA Vol.0, the story is pretty interresting if you take your time to read it.  This game includes both cute achievements and characters. Each character has a very adorable voice to speak to you as they move about in a 3D motion. It's also nice to be able to pat them on the head and show affeciton to them.  The game helps people kinda feel a connection to the characters with a smart move of adding the 3D effects, interation options and also having their cheery voices talk to you all the time!  I recommend this game to people who are ok with not having to choose options of how the story goes and can just watch it as a visual novel. Please keep in note that the game can become NSFW in some parts!
BUT CATGIRLS REM, CAAAAATGIRLSSSSSSSS
there is cat
Honest review? Nice visuals, good +18 DLC, terrible story. I couldn't get in into it, felt boring, not even a single choice. If I have to rate it, 5/10.  Review honesta? Linda visual, buen DLC +18, una historia terrible. No pude meterme en la trama, se sintió aburrida, no tiene ni una sola elección. Si tengo que darle rating, 5/10.
fapped
You know what you're getting in to and it delivers
Great game, this is the starting plot for the Nekopara OVA, better with the 18+ dlc, pretty expansive, otherwise worth it
So much fun and so cute.
Yes.
Cat girls ✓ Chibi cat girls ✓ Bounciness slider ✓ Graphic sex scenes ✓ 11/10
remove it from steam
nya~
Too much clicking, not enough dicking...    Story had me on the edge of my seat though, 10/10
good
This is a good game. I think this masterpiece design is 100 hours (and counts), so I can guarantee it and will probably be nominated for Game Master. The jiggle mechanism is balanced and enhances gameplay. Mechanics enable cooperative gameplay. The frustration of the game is that you have to pay for sexy scenes. I want to show my cat daughter's breast without paying insurance premiums. I have one question. Does Cat Girl creator Elon Mask make cameos in the game? He is truly revolutionary in the cat and girl industry and has improved many people's lives with his research. 10/10 recommend a good time;)  Sorry in my bad english, it is not my first language :/
Nekopara is good and I'm tired of pretending it's not
good
God can you forgive my sin that I witness something ecchi
Very good game!  Best settings for 300fps gameplay: 1) Fullscreen (Not windowed) 2) 1980x1080 (16:9) 3) Chest Bounciness Maxed Out  4) Left-Handed gameplay
This is some good shit. Best game ever nekos ok  couple hundred hours later. ive finally mastered the art of pastry.
(◕ᴗ◕✿) nya
this game is super cute if you like neko, catgirls.
5/5 nya!~
epic
Great Story :D
catgirls nyaaaaa!  All of my pride is gone oof
10/10  I have lost all my pride
10/10 let me touch again
Catzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Would buy Nekopara again 10/10.
haha funny catgirl chest go bounce
As a person who genuinely loves visual novels, for me Nekopara was just really insanely boring. I assume most its fans haven't played many other visual novels if they consider this one to actually be a "good" visual novel.
The perfect game for a lonely weeb like me,the adult patch makes it even better.
Many cat girls, high implications of incest. All around good time. It's the censored version btw, so it's mostly a cute story with some ecchi.
Everyone has some fun playing around with cat's it's a great time.
N U T
Is it bad I played this for the plot?
uwu
Call me a degenerate idc but these girls hella cute
It gets spicy from chapter 5.
bye game
memes
i really liked this game 12/10 would buy again
Download the demo first and if u love it you will love the game and please get the full pack i got them seperately and i feel like i wasted money  great story  i love these cute little romance neko stuff way more than the horror stuff
definitely worthwhile if your dad went off to buy milk
its a good game
hey hey people seth here
great game for playing with one hand
UwU Senpai
Wholesome content to stream on discord to the ye O' ebois.
cats
this game will make u happy :)
An excellent VN with excellent characters.
nekos are life yo
absolute art
It Is the best game of the World!!!!!!! COCONUT IS THE BEST GIRL!
This game changed my life. Before, I was just a lonely little hermit sitting alone in my house all the time, and this game completely turned it around. Now, I'm getting all the catgirls at my door and I'm not lonely anymore. Thank you, Nekopara.
big kitty tids v hot <3 playable w/ one hand, can confirm
This game is absolutely god damn adorable. With a good bonus if you get the full experience.
yes
Catgirls are life. That is all there is to it. If the real world had catgirls we would be in a better place.
Even though it would be morally kinda wrong to genetically engineer catgirls, I still wouldn't mind inviting some to be a family...
This game made my friend a furry weeb. But pretty good graphics I guess. btw don't buy the h patch download it for free online. anyways good game get it when it in the bundle of all other games
cum
me like it
I came here for cat-girls, found only cats with cute clothes.  Meow?
this game has lot of sex but remove every scene with shigure,game make wewe veri har
porno
The story is cute but nothing to write home about. Art, animation, and voice acting all get high marks. However, if you want maximum enjoyment from this game, you're gonna need the 18+ DLC. The H-scenes in this game are nothing short of erotic bliss.
The only issue is that the characters are 9 months old which makes me question my morals
the music was good.
This made me really uncomfortable. I bought this as a joke and now my friend thinks I'm a paedophile. Wack as hell
very fun
yes
Good game for cat lovers! Fantastic background knowledge about cats is given, and the game is really cute =)
Elon Musk would be proud.
Cat Paradise :D
yes
I might be the loser in real life, but in the Nekopara world, you're the loser
It's so good! It's also a much bigger game than I thought!
This game, what to say, honestly, it's a life changing experience. The ups, the downs, it has emotionally touched my heart and I feel compelled to share with others how much of a great game this is. There is so much depth to its lore. Absolutely astounding, 10/10 would most DEFINATELY buy again
Best FPS game in the world
be wary of mating season
I LOVED IT, IT'S JUST ART, DEFINITLY ART
I just followed the herd. The novel is boring.
Make grandma proud.

This game is very fuckin recommended to make your boner more hard
Love meself some chocola creme pie ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
hmm this game make me go what if cat hav t1ts and pusy
really good game
Nyan Nyan
It takes about 2 hours before you can bang your cats. 3 hours total to complete this. No choices at all for different CGs. Vanilla > Chocola IMO. You'll have to idle for cards.   If you haven't try NEKO-NIN exHeart. Not nearly as popular but I enjoyed that more. But this is a good start to the series.  If you are trying to copy/paste the 18+ version of the game you are probably going to come up with errors for some reason. Just find the patch on F95 and save yourself a headache.
Humanity has peaked.
cute
heh heh yea boi
yes
WHERE IS MY PET BUTTON REEEEEEEEE
Love it
yuuuuuuuup
it good
Great game
After returning to have some chuckles to the game after 5 years pasted. This is total bullshit, now I regret buying it because the developer ruined the game. In steam version of this game, there are no R18 scenes, but I was aware of that and hadn't really think about that, cause back in 2015 - You didn't have to search the internet for patch and just download it from the developer website. And now (idk since when) they're charging us with 10 bucks to buy a DLC to look at anime c-u nt, are you fucking kidding me right now? If you have any self-respect left in you, don't buy this and any other games from this greedy developer.
i cummed playing this
alright, i really dont understand people who prefer chocola over vanilla. like yeah sure, girls with brown hair are cute, but vanillas personality is so superior to chocolas. who doesnt want a like 1 week old catgirl to look at you all smug and call you a pervert? anyone who likes chocola more is a weird normie because she really isnt any better than vanilla.  anyways buy the game
Thanks Mom, Thanks Dad
tiddies
It's a story about a little sister that loves you romantically, but since you're unwilling to engage in a relationship that taboo, she sends two of her catgirls to be your girlfriends instead (which is apparently just the right level of taboo for your character). It's super weird, but if you don't take it too seriously it's actually a fun little visual novel.   Pros: -Great Art -Adorable characters. Yes, I have a weakness for anime catgirls.   -It sticks to the genre without being overly long. This technically isn't a game, but it's also not trying to be. It's a short visual novel without any extra expectations or baggage.  -Pretty much anime crack (or catnip, if you prefer)  Cons: -The story is nonsense. As mentioned above, it's anime crack. If you're looking for something deeper, this ain't it. At least the game knows what it is though. I hate visual novels and anime that act like they're so deep and meaningful but are just bloated, edgy teen fodder *coughattackontitancoughcodegeasscough*.  -Music is just OK, and gets repetitive fast.   Neutral: -There is 18+ DLC for anyone into that. Whether that's a pro or con is up to you.
A pretty typical SoL with catgirls. Didn't personally get much out of it due to both love interests being too childlike for me, but future volumes will hopefully improve on that. Art and voice acting is 10/10 tho.  Also dear lord this game reminded me of why I hate hentai protagonists.
Hentai is love and life
Very educational!
Yes Please YimYum
.
Buy it. You want it, I know. You need it, I know.
I REJECT MY HUMANITY, JOJO!
its too good till my NUT button's numb :D
This is what I need
Pizza Hut Stuffed Crust Hot 'Za ©      No One Can Out Pizza The Hut.

Great game for all ages
Hell yeah, boobies
is gud

cute like angel
e
uWU ~nyya
Cute cat girls, need I say more?
good game for those who don't have girl friend:D
A cute, 2 to 4 hour kinetic novel with catgirls. There's a lot of NSFW elements, and some other things that might turn people off: for example, there's overt, one-sided incest. On the other hand, the catgirls are bisexual and poly.   For a simple and cute KN, I was happy with what I got.
Absolutely amazing story. Full of love and laughter. Nekopara is one of my absolute faves!!
its a prety wholesome game but i dunno y my pp become hard  10/10 would recommend if u like wholesum 9/10 if u dont want pp hard for no reason
OOOOOOOOOHHH GOD IM COOOMING
Good Game, Would play again
yatta
this makes my pp big.
cat is fine too
Nice
This VN is one of the best regarded VN's on steam an overwhelming positive score and with good reason. It is the first chapter in one of the greats of VN's.  https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31309147-South-Coast-NSW/
This game attracts me a lot (even when the 18+ DLC is disable to use) . A GOOD GAME !  :)
I LOVE IT
girls are pretty cute the MC is not very cute music is pretty cute DLC content is pretty cute game is pretty cute
Absolutely adorable. Would buy again. and again.and again.and again.and again.and again.
I hate myself
I hate catgirls ty
this is the third game in the massive franchise portal 1 (which is in the same franchise as left 4 dead 2) great game but i think i needs work in the half life head crabs but nonetheless very good game and is worth the money especially if playing with family and friendS!
NEKO'S
good for the whole family
The short. It is an interesting game, you should get it and get your friends it. the DLC is worth it.  The long.  [spoiler]You thought Nekopara was a cute family friendly game about catgirls? NO! Steam has pushed its agenda again. They recently forced the devs to add explicit sexual content to this one family friendly game. Which got me to look deeper into what Nekopara actually is. Upon playing the game with that disgusting extra content added I started to realize something. These "cat girls" are like low functioning autistic children. and you groom them into becoming your sex slaves. Now, after the first game, it didn't seem like it was going that far. it seriously just seemed like they were trying to force explicit sexual content onto the children, which is disgusting as is. but once you play the other games  you start to see. First he grooms the first two cat girls (autistic children) into becoming his sex slaves. The next two games he does exactly the same thing to the rest of them. two new girls each game.[/spoiler]
No no no, what the hell did I just play. A kinetic novel about 2 catgirls that look like 15, but have the brain of 8 year olds, having sex with a dude in his 20's and oh yeah they open a cake shop in between. Not ok. I've played other games that during one of the storylines in the game feature these Lolly kind of relationships, and I've played and even enjoyed some of these storylines. But they had a story between the lewd stuff, and after fast forwarding any lewd scene there was something left. With this game you don't get a choice, the lolly story is all there is. and there isn't really any story there to begin with.   So a beautifully animated game that takes about 4/5 hours, with almost no story that features a lolly relation with 2 catgirls that look 15 but act like they are 8 that's all this is and that's something I just cannot recommend.
ye
It's better than Call of Duty: Ghosts.
my cat  has passed on because of this game
Amazing, I already came within the first hour
Why is the FBI here?
One Word, Catgirls
I have had to play for 4 hours to reach my first DLC scene, worth ever second and every penny
squelch
WHY MY PP H A R D?
every weeb must have it.
Music of a fictional generation that was once lost, but now is found https://youtu.be/-DcWzPyoRMs
Nyaa¬
yES
yes
My parents stopped talking to me, all my friends abandoned me, and the FBI is constantly knocking at my door. But it was all worth it because now I am surrounded by cat girls. Truly the greatest game of all time. 11/10
I have played this whole game and 100%ed its achievements. Please spare me God...
it good, give it a try
The only reason I recommend this game is because if your looking at this game your most likely doing one or more of 3 things: 1. Your a coomer, 2. Your a weeb who loves boring slice of life, 3. Your buying for a friend as a joke. And if those are your reasons for buying the game then you'll be happy with your purchase and you dont need to read the rest of this review. Now if your like me and and have certain views when it comes to games like this then buckle up because i'm about to rant.   I'm gonna start by saying that I like TNA as much as the next guy but the way this game works it in is kinda weird. The catgirls have some sort of mating thing where they are just horny which is super weird to me at least because the game portrays the catgirls as your children/pets. So imagine fucking your kid that's kinda fucked up to and that's exactly how it felt every time. In fact there's literally a scene after a sex scene where the dude says the cat girls are like his kids and lovers which as a sentence is fucked dude.   Now when it comes to the plot it could not get more boring (thats my own opinion not saying it's a fact) it's a classic slice of life with a shit ton of anime tropes that I personally do not enjoy. In a nutshell your watching cat girls be cute for 8 hours. This is classic example of the slice of life anime joke: Hey dude what happened in the new chapter? Bro nothing. Like I literally almost fell asleep at one point. But again this is my own opinion and if you like happy funny cute wholesome chungus reddit 100 moments then you'll have a field day with this game.  That's pretty much every aspect of the game and if you like sex and cute anime girls then boom you got yourself the perfect game. In my opinion though there's better things to spend $25 on. If you disagree with anything I said then cool thats your own opinion feel free to yell at me in comments.
this game stole my soul
Make me nosebleeding.
Only one story path with only one ending. There is a story but only in the most liberal definition of one. Getting through said story is a bit of a slog and that's saying something because it's not very long. The plot goes no where and honestly the central conflict in the story is resolved in the first hour the next three is just pointless nonsense and retreading similar ground as the first hour. Really not worth the money.   The graphics are above average for a visual novel mostly in the fact that it is animated and i guess the music suits the fluff atmosphere but nothing particularly groundbreaking here. When i say animated i'm not talking School Days animated, more Tokyo School Life Animated. I can't speak much on the voice acting because i don't speak a word of Japanese. If a word or sentence was delivered awkwardly i would not know the difference.  Its only has value for the sexiness but even that's lacking unless you buy a DLC which costs as much as the game itself effectively doubling the price.   Unless you are really into fetishistic cat girls (and honestly you likely are if you are even viewing this game) or really into moe fluff where every character can be best described as ether a potato or a marshmallow or rather a combination of those, there is no way I can recommend this title. But if you are into those things then in all likelihood you have already purchased this game and as such my opinion of your moe cat porn novel is irrelevant to you.  Side note: These cat girls behave more like dogs. Real cats are jerks so I would figure a cat girl wouldn't be any different. There needs to be a dog girl game, then at least the overly inyourfaceness of the girls and the only calling you Master would make some semblance of sense. There is also the social implications of this society of cat girls but lets not get into that. (that could have made for an interesting story actually)
Cute visual novel with fun and loveable characters
I'm sorry mom. 7/10
Cat gamer moment
its hot
When life was hard, when no girls were around me, catgirls were always by my side. Thank you Nekopara for saving my ass from serious depression. UwU
no
Love it. wish I didn't get a heart attack while  playing it though.
This game is such a masterpiece. I was 100% here for the story related content and definitely not the nekoporn aspect of the game.
10/10 would fap again
In conclusion, my dick hard
trash :/ played for like an hr and didnt even get to fuck them :/
I played through all the Nekopara visual novels if an JRPG of Nekopara came out I mean I would get into it of playing it. They're all cute with funny scenes. If you love catgirls then I recommend getting the Nekopara visual novel series.
seCs
its honestly so fun to sit and read/watch through this VN, its 100% with the 18+ dlc but its enjoyable either way :)
Delicious
Very Nice
it was hard for me because i can't read not bad
Anime was a mistake
i like this game because for once I'm liked
no
Well...here it is...my review of NEKOPARA Vol. 1. Honestly I don't where to start this game and franchise has become the most addictive thing imaginable to me. However, I'll try to get through this anyway so here goes.  NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a visual novel game with the option of purchasable 18+ content, soundtracks, an artbook and the NEKOPARA OVA Set. The game is set in Japan in a fantasy world where creatures called "catgirls" exist. Catgirls are the combination of a human female and a feline, specifically their body is that of a human with the only exception being that they have cat ears, tails and their ears/tails are the same colour as their hair/fur. The main "protagonist" is a young guy called Kashou Minaduki. He has a younger sister named Shigure and they both own six catgirls. Those catgirls from eldest to youngest go: Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon and Coconut with the youngest of the catgirls being a pair of twin sisters named Chocola and Vanilla and during the time this game is set they are 9 months old in human years. The story in this volume starts off with Kashou moving from the Minaduki household to his own bakery to start his own business "La Soleil" as a patisserie. Chocola and Vanilla hear about the news and set out to get their master to let them stay with him. I won't spoil the rest of the game otherwise some people will complain and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who is thinking of buying it.   Now that the story has been dealt with, what do I think of the game? Well, if you couldn't already tell from my steam profile and steam inventory, I LOVE IT! The characters are animated using a software called E-mote, an advanced software that allows NEKOWORKs to animate the character's bodies. The story is wonderful and was good enough to make me buy volumes 2 and 3 to see the rest of the story and even buy NEKOPARA Extra and volume 0 to see the events before volume 1. If you're here for the 18+ content, you won't be disappointed I would say it's definitely worth it's price and I thoroughly enjoyed the game. The soundtracks to NEKOPARA Vol. 1 are incredible but to be honest the soundtracks are incredible throughout the NEKOPARA franchise. The Vol. 1 artbook is nice and comes in a PDF format in the game's files in the Steam directory. The NEKOPARA OVA Set, in my opinion, is worth the money as it provides you with the 210 page NEKOPARA Chronicles artbook (definitely worth the money just on it's own) and the soundtracks of the NEKOPARA OVA which are as stated earlier incredible (although I prefer the in-game music more than the OVA music I cannot complain).  Do you want catgirls? Do you want a good, gripping story that spans across five games (with Vol. 4 in production and Vol. 5 planned that would make it 7 games)? Do you want 18+ content that you can watch again if you want to at anytime? Do you want some nice theme songs and music to listen to? If you want all of these NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is worth it for you. Before you pay for the full game I recommend downloading the demo and playing that as it goes through the game to the intro video and stops there. Obviously it's up to you if you'd like to purchase specific DLC and leave out others but I'd definitely recommend all the DLC and especially that if you get the game, you get the 18+ content for it too.  If you would've told me one year ago I'd be not only playing this franchise but addicted to it to the point of purchasing figurines, snapback caps, soundtracks, artbooks, all the games, the OVA and OVA Extra, and a huge collection of steam items including the badges, the foil and non-foil trading cards, the backgrounds and the emoticons, then I'd say you're delusional. That was one year ago, here I am now making this review and not regretting getting into this franchise as much as I've done. It's brought so much happiness to me and I've even talked about it with my parents and they have accepted the fact that I play it even with 18+ content. If you want further information on the franchise it won't be difficult to find. This game will always be remembered as the start of an addiction that I love and I'm happy I started.  NEKOPARA isn't for everyone but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying it. If you're not too rushed about purchasing it then I'd wait till a Steam Sale and purchase it then, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks NEKOWORKs, Sayori, Sekai Project and anyone who has worked on the NEKOPARA franchise as a whole, I look forward to the Nekoparaiten mobile game, the rest of the TV anime series and NEKOPARA Vol. 4 and Vol. 5.  That's it for this review, sorry for making it so long but I kind of had to. It's the one thing that has made me happier ever since.
wholesome game play and rich storytelling very captivating experience only problem is friends wont stop asking me about it and calling me gay so overall 9/10 would do again
Worth it but wish there would be deals more often, still amazing regardless.
Sayori does good work on the art and animation as always and who doesnt love a cute story about literal cat girls and a bakery.
very nice
More catgirls.
2D > 3D
First the Kiss, Then the ___.
Has a boob slider, 'nough said.
Very wholesome game. Can never go wrong with cat girls so this is an easy choice here.
These cat girls are 9 months old.  FBI OPEN THE DOOR!
The best part is the reviews.
I'm so confused playing this .........game?
Dad left me because of this game. Would play again 11/10
This is Good Civilization.
Wholesome neko fun unless you get the R-18 patch ;)
good game x2
Truly a very immersive narrative horror game that my foreskin crawl.
[b]Vanilla[/b] is a clever and quiet catgirl who loves Chocola. She is Chocola’s twin sister and the youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. [b]Vanilla[/b] is prone to be misunderstood because she rarely expresses her emotions. In fact, she is quite smart and often makes some remarkable insights. Her sharp wit and I’ll-do-things-my-way attitude make her Chocola’s complete opposite. However, she remains both kind-hearted and, well, catlike.  In contrast to her twin Chocola, [b]Vanilla[/b]'s ears, tail and hair are primarily white with a subtle pink undertone. She has blue eyes which are often slightly squinted, and her hair is tied up and styled as twin tails supported by a blue ribbon strand.  Her usual attire consists of a light blue and navy blue lolita-style dress with white shin-length socks with garter trims and blue Mary Jane shoes. She wears two large blue ribbons; one on the top of her head and one on her collar. Her left hand is lightly wrapped around with a blue string and she wears a small garter near the tip of her tail.  [b]Vanilla[/b] is quiet, calm and very stoic. She rarely expresses her emotions, making her a somewhat of a kūdere character, as opposed to her sister's energetic, playful personality. She loves her twin sister Chocola and will accompany her always due to her sis-con-like relationship towards her.  [b]Race:[/b] Catgirl [b]Breed:[/b] Mixed Breed [b]Gender:[/b] Female [b]Age:[/b] 9 months old [i](11 years old in human age)[/i]
A really good Light Novel
I played the version with "Adult only Content."  This is a great game if you like cat girls and adult content (including sex). -> You might want to skip vol 0 though.  * It took me a bit less than 14 hours to get through it the first time. * The genitals are censored, however, the rest is Uncensored. It would be nice if they made a fully uncensored version.
One of the best visual novels out there. It truly can't get any better than this. You got cats, unfinished soda, fat steak, and people.  10/10
"They were like daughters but also lovers."
hold space. get all achievements. uninstall.
made me suck my own dick quality game reccomend you buy
yessur
Awesome game!!  This game is very enjoyable and brings happiness to my frozen hikki heart
i played with nekos
It's a visual novel about fucking cakes and fucking cats. One of those is an expletive, and the other is a verb. I'll let you figure out which is which on your own.
While NEKOPARA is not like other visual novels where the player can make many choices that impact the final outcome, it has by far one of the best visuals and linear stories I have seen in both visual novels and shows.
This game has had a positive impact on my life.
catgorls nice mmnyes 100 out of 10
May God have mercy on my soul!
very good game i like cat
yeah its nice
nya
Nice!

cute cat grils and nya nya nya =^.^= gud vn 10/10
Would you recommend this game to other players? game of the decade
uwu
i like
I have reached new levels of catlightenment on the intricacies of catgirls and catpanions. I have rightfully earned my bell and love my catgirls. Game needs more Coconut, but still good.
Many good
Neko Girls, do you need another reason?
Best christmas gift ive ever recieved honostly best game ever love it would give 10/10
אני מעלים מס מאז 2007
yes
Helllllll yeah.
Definitely a must for any neko lover. The characters are great, the visuals are wonderful and I love the story. I haven't played the other 2 volumes as of this review but I know that they'll be as great as this one.
This game is surprisingly heart-warming. I didn't expect to like this game, but after playing it it was really surprising how amazing it was! Highly recommended if you like games like this. 5/5
I love it <3 <3 <3
MEOW~MEOW!
This is the best game I have in steam library; highly recommended, everyone should try it
Yes, the storyline is fantastic get it and play it.   Any dislikes is fine but it just shows how much you people hate anime. ;)
Best VN there is.
oh yes the nyan nyan ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
easy to learn, hard to master
Oh yes
i am no longer eligible for financial compensation  also boobies
It’s good, I always liked dogs.
god damn it
Yes.
Even without paying the horny tax, the story and characters were engaging. Couldn't help feeling moved in certain points. There is a feature to this visual novel that I wish was a standard and that is the auto-play feature. For some reason, and this is going to sound lethargic and pathetic, but hitting spacebar to continue in visual novels is a big reason why I shelve them despite recommendation.   Pretty great VN, sad there is a horny tax but even without paying the tax its an entertaining experience.
I can recommend this Game.
fuck cats literally and figuratively
i can explain,
I got my money's worth
Loli catgirls heck yeah
Very best catgirls, highly good gameplay, im hooked
This game is very good and has an outstanding story line that I never played. I love the wacky, fun characters that make me touch my pp. I really think this game is a unique FPS that makes me want to see elon musk make cat girls in real life. The only complaint I have is the rating of the game as I cant show my son the large breasts that some of these characters have to slowly teach him the woman private parts. Sexual education is no joke and I feel this game has the potential to teach kids about it. Great all around game developers
yes... vanilla and chocolate
amazing Story
chocola > any real life girl  100% true
Censored Version
The story is amazing and fun. I had to keep going to see how it ended. The animation was smooth, seamless and absolutely adorable. The audio was crisp and clear, with so much emotion from the VA's, that the tear jerking moments had me at the edge of my seat.  And although the 18+ DLC patch isn't required to enjoy the story, it adds an element to the character depth that I would not recommend skipping.  This game is so well worth the money, that I'd buy it again. 100%
A "by the books" anime porn game that has had It's main selling point stripped before being uploaded onto Steam which REALLY makes you question why It's here. Time for a proper ADULT section, Valve.
really quite an epic game
This game would be better if they made up their minds about cat girls having human rights or not. At some points they're treated like normal girls and the next like minorities in the 50s.
Never did I think I would sob during a game full of catgrils until I realized thats how it be.
Yeet i have a problem.
Very Gud
I'like this game
ฅ/ᐠ｡ᆽ｡ᐟ \
I'm Sorry
Ohhhh, c'mon, why would you even start reading the reviews? There are CATGIRLS!!! Who doesn't love catgirls? Oh yeah the only problem is that 18+ patch costs almost as much as the actual game, but, believe me, it's worth it!
IF you are cat lover this is your game
The Perfect [spoiler]Hentai Lewd Nekos[/spoiler] Game, The OST (Exp,Abiyou) Is Very Nice. The Content/Story Of The Game Is Damn Good [spoiler]Although Hentai Is Removed I Guess And U Need To Spend To Buy Hentai DLC[/spoiler] The Nekogirls(Espercially Vanilla)Are Kawail [spoiler]And Lewd [/spoiler]  Overall,The Game Is 9/10 For Me [spoiler]If They Added The Hentai DLC[/spoiler]  Duh.Best FPS game,BTW.
heh
Who would have thought that the weirdest thing in a game about catgirls is actually your little sister, who is 100% human? Me neither, but it happened.  In all fairness, the dialogue was at times truly hilarious - I found myself laughing at my pc a couple of times whereas this game is clearly not (primarily) meant for that, but it really got me at times with Vanilla's witty remarks. There's also quite a bit of cheesy talk near the end which I was a bit less of a fan of, but nothing that really broke the experience for me.   Truth be told, I did look up the uncensor patch, but it would seem that it did not work after I installed it - I actually feel like that was not such a bad thing in the end. Most of the experience for me now was just a light-hearted, genuinly funny visual novel with clear attention to detail, from their facial expressions (which only very rarely ventured into the uncanny valley) to their motions (yes, there is a 'chest bounciness' slider in the menu which I kept at about half, which seemed fine), to the voice acting, which was pretty well done in my opinion (despite every other sentence ending with a meow, but you get desensitised pretty quickly).   Now, to address the elephant in the room, is it worth the full price? I would have to say 'no' unfortunately, for the gameplay is literally non-existent to the point that if you would check 'auto' and leave, your computer would play the whole game for you to the end in about 6 hours. I got it in a -50% sale and I think that then it is about worth it, if you can appreciate these kind of things, that is.  Long story short, I would actually recommend to 'play' this game exactly how it is on steam, for it offers a nice feel-good story with cute characters that makes you forget about the world around you, but just not enough to prevent you from looking over you shoulder periodically, because... you know, just in case. Even though it is all pretty harmless in the end. If you are looking for a very deep story, this is not the place to look, but you already knew that from the start. If you are looking for something very erotic, I would just recommend opening an incognito tab in google and go have fun that way. If you just want to enjoy a couple of relaxing evenings, consider giving it a go. Who knows, maybe you'll like it.  One concluding remark: I don't think playing this game or any related stuff is something to be ashamed of. You were probably expecting me to say something like 'this game was gifted to me ;_;' or 'I was forced to play this lol', but you know what? I bought this game for myself because it seemed fun. There. I said it. And in the end, it was indeed fun, I laughed and the girls were cute - I have no regrets. No regrets at all.  So, that was all I had to say, sitting behind my pc at 3 AM (yes, I know I'm not living up to my statements in previous paragraph, but at least I didn't set my status to offline, which I know you will). And after all this only one question remains: why did I go through the effort of seriously reviewing this game in the first place? Perhaps some questions are better left unanswered.
Pretty damn nice ya'll
猫耳美少女谁不爱呢？
cute, anime lover good
Nice
Cute
Yes.
this game does NOT give you the option to have the cute anime loli's talk to you, I don't care if there's a story. I as a professional weeaboo must have this kind of interaction. even just imagining the cute anime loli's to go "DAISUKI NICK-KUN" would make my heart flutter and make me giddy like a drunken man. but honestly, this game is my only 100%'d game on steam, and that makes me kind of nervous, so instead i'm going to embrace this and hopefully allow myself to overcome my insecurities.  #NEKOPARA4MULTIPLAYER
UwU ❤❤ Licki some dicki 😰
Pat the cat make me so happy and open minded
These Neko heal my soul
amazing
Elon-chan we need Neko Girls
my degeneracy won in the end  take my wallet  10/10
これまでのところ、私はこの物語を非常に楽しんでいる、それは非常にかわいい物語です。猫の女の子はとてもかわいいです! So far I am enjoying this story immensely, it is a very cute story. The catgirls are so cute!
Wholesome, heart warming romance 10/10
the girl are cute , story is heartwarming and funny . One of the best visual novel game out there ,great choice for who want to start play visual novel type game.
Personal Rating \\ 10/10   This game is a masterfully crafted first-person shooter with the charm of Titanfall 2 and the fast-paced, shoot to kill feel of Call of Duty. I couldn't recommend this game more to my friends. I've spent dozens of hours playing this game and its many, many modes.  Search and Destroy has to be my favorite, especially since the characters, such as Coconut and Vanilla, don't impact gameplay as much as they do in the TDM mode. Each character has their quirks and bugs but in all honesty, none of them are gamebreaking. I do believe however that the developers made a good decision in allowing a photography mode into the singleplayer campaign.  On the note of campaign. Every second of it is an artistic masterpiece and the player is (or should be) always engaged in the character design and how the characters constantly stay interesting throughout the complete story. The plot never feels too confusing or stereotypical. Controls are extremely fluid and have a massive amount of customizability. You never feel too weak or too strong, and you never feel like there's no way to make an impact, even from moment one. There are plenty of available weapons and even more you can unlock. Many of them are cosmetic, but others are unique weapons with many easter eggs. No spoilers :)  Honestly, if I had to play only one game for the rest of my life, it'd have to be Nekopara, any of them in the series.  PS: Vanilla still best girl
Wholesome family story ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
VERY VERY high quality.
Nekopara spoke to me on an emotional level i wasn't expecting. Playing this game made me run through tissues it was so beautiful.
Pretty good game  I will always nominate this game every year for being the best game of the Year
These nekos have changed my life. My one true life goal now is to open a neko meido themed bakery/café. I want it to have an upstairs loft which I can live in with my many cats. I've been practicing baking just for this special endeavor, and I think I'm on my way to becoming a master pasty puffer! When people taste my baked goods, I want them to think as though they're flying amongst beautiful puff pastry clouds overlooking rivers flowing with white sugar, pink frosted donuts, and kawaii macarons. This is currently the most important thing in the world to me right now and I hope I’m successful.  Also, Vanilla best cat!!  11/10
Cute!
I nominate Vanilla for best hair.
want lactose )))
Vanilla is the best Catgirl (๑ơ ₃ ơ)♥
cute characters, fun dialouge
我TM社保！！ 很好玩的FPS游戏，为了R18  DLCC特意转到了香港区。
This game is pretty neat i ain't gonna lie.  10/10               Might have fapped to it. ;)
only reason im alive
i failed no nut
This is the best game I have ever played
I have to say, the ranked matchmaking and competitive side of the game is very fun.
Proper fit birds
Good VN for those who love nekos and cute girls in general. If you've seen the OVA, this is mostly the same, just with a few extra scenes, as well as H-scenes.
I think i bought the wrong chocolate
Totally worth it, 10/10
Not too long. Part 1 and 2 are like 5 hours. And part 3 is like 7 hours. But the whole series is very cute and fun. Superb voice acting. Gorgeous animated CGs with idle breathing animations, moving mouths, emoting and other things like that. So really high production value. Virtually no bugs. I had 2 or 3 occasions, where the text would not fit the voice, but nothing serious. Every character has a little arc to it, which makes it a joy to read. And there are also some emotional moments for each character and a satisfying "end" for every one. This alone would make it a really good VN. But then there's all the lewd scenes, if you decided to buy the 18+ DLCs. Those ramp up the quality to 11. They are animated in something that looks like 2.5D, relatively long and good finishes. You get a couple of thoose per character. So that's basically the cherry on the pie.  You can totally ebjoy the all-ages version. But I think, the 18+ stuff is also worth it's money.  So overall, a really great, really cute, really fun VN series.
Yeet
This game is awesome. Amazing graphics, story plot and jiggle physics for plot XP.
haha they do the fuck l0l
NEKOS IS MY RELIGION
shigure lit cats need not apply
im spent
good game
Pressing the P Button is the most satisfying thing in the world *wink wink ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*
Catgirls paradise what else do i have to say
cute catgirl harem, jiggle physics and a sweet story. literally what else does one need in a game?
how 2 hide from friendos
Guys, this is exactly what you want :)
Ewan McGregor really helped sell the emotion of the movie, acting phenomenally considering that a majority of his co-stars were CGI stuffed animals. As the movie progresses, his character becomes less and less serious and more playful, and McGregor pulls this transition off phenomenally, being both funny and believable. Many actors, specifically comedy actors, would have overdone this transition, making their funny moments over the top just to get a laugh. McGregor still managed to get a laugh, humorously yet believably becoming more like Pooh as the movie progressed in a natural, yet still entertaining manner.  While the return of all of the animal characters was fantastic, Pooh truly stood out as the star of the show. Eeyore's self loathing, Piglet's anxiety, and Tigger's pride with his uniqueness certainly added their own factors to the mix, but Pooh still stood out. This movie reminded audiences of why Winnie the Pooh was such a great character to begin with: he represents everything good in this world. He teaches us to appreciate the little things and to take the time to appreciate what you have.   The genius part of Christopher Robin is that, when the movie actually started, Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh were polar opposites. This was an incredibly clever way to start the story, as in all of the previous Winnie the Pooh stories, Christopher Robin and Pooh were almost always on the same page. This change to Christopher Robin's character added a new twist to the movie that would certainly be relatable for any adults who watched Winnie the Pooh as a kid. This entire piece of character development was a clever writing twist that certainly helped to keep the movie incredibly interesting.  Another factor that kept the movie interesting and visually entertaining was the color scheme. While the trailers showed that it would have a desaturated look, the finished product itself had a gorgeous red tint to it. It made the sunset scenes in Hundred Acre Wood absolutely beautiful, turning the classic scenes from the cartoons and books into an even more gorgeous piece of imagery.  All things considered, the latest live-action movie from Walt Disney Pictures is a truly heartwarming experience that any Disney fan is sure to enjoy. The return of the classic characters, and the in-depth development from Christopher Robin, portrayed by Ewan McGregor, made the movie enjoyable and touching. Though it may not bring in the big bucks like Beauty and the Beast did, Christopher Robin is still a great success from Disney and stands out from the rest of their live-action movies.
Good
Coconut Cwannnnn~~ <3
I don't regret buying the r18 DLC one bit
beat my 12 y/o shmeat
Fun drinking game: Take a shot every time Chocola says "goshujin-sama"
Gotta be real with you. Visual novels are not games. Cute cats though.
Vanilla has wrapped me around her soft pinky finger and dragged me into Nekopara Hell. I'm in love with this franchise and the games they've produced. I started off with Nekopara Vol 0 and was instantly in love with the game and the story. My Hell currently sees me surrounded by adorable Nekopara girls and I couldn't be happier.  For real though, I'd high recommend this game. The graphics are amazing, I love the story line and it's a VN I can easily put a bunch of hours into, especially since I have Vols 0, 1, 2 and 3 and wanting to get the others. It's not a short VN by any means, which is something I always tend to hate with others. You jump on expecting a full length novel and you finish the game within 30 minutes. At the time of this review, I've sunk in 4 hours and I'm barely at the middle! I can't wait to finish this
chief, this is it!
It's a pleasurable family experience, just without the family
Why is my keyboard covered in mayonnaise? / 10
my parents don't know how to put me up for adoption so i'm safe for now
As a VeryProEngie. I approve.
I am GOD
Only play when you're horny. Boring as hell otherwise. Same for the other volumes
good
it's hentai
I play this for the plot.  10/10.
The arts good, HD Kat tits, shame the pee pees and vaginas are uncensored. 9/10 would recommend
Oh, this- This is beautiful.  18/18 would play again.
This cured my cancer, thank you NEKO WORKs, very cool!
What's wrong with the game? It's just cats, right? RIGHT!?
This dont really need reccomendation, but I just wanted to admit that I am a disgusting degenerate pervv that loves this series, and if you are too, then it is a must have, with all +18 content. 10/10
I've enjoyed the game so far, close to beating it. Still getting a grip on the mechanics, its a little complex, but that's what I came here for. Not sure what this 18+ plus mod is, but once I finish the main game, I'll be sure to check it out
*Coughs* Yes
This is practically my life. Thank you to the creator of this game!!!!!
Yes
Does this make me a furry?
[quote] Please follow our curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see more reviews like this one!	[/quote]  [h1]Introduction[/h1]  Nekopara is a popular visual novel. It is mainly known for its stunning art, and for its mature content, which are unlocked through a paid DLC. This VN is fully voiced, and the sprites are all fully animated too. While the story is mediocre at best, it definitely makes up for it with the stunning art and the wonderful soundtracks!  In Nekopara, you play as Kashou Minaduki, a young adult male who is about to open his own patisserie in order to pursue his dreams. He’s all set, ready to open up the next day, when he suddenly notices two of the family’s catgirls have managed to sneak in! Unable to send them back due to their love for him, Kashou has to try and manage a business and look after the catgirls too!  [h1]Pros[/h1]  - Stunning art. Seriously. The sprites are all animated smoothly, and the cg’s are absolutely beautiful too. - Fully voiced. With the exception of the protagonist, all the characters are fully voiced. While there isn’t an English dub, the Japanese voice actors still did really well. - The NSFW scenes are really well written and honestly, some of the best I’ve seen. Which makes sense since Nekopara is promoted as a game well-known for its mature content.  [h1]Cons[/h1]  - The story is pretty bland, but most slice of life stories can be lacking in story. - Unable to play as a female protagonist. - You have to pay extra for the NSFW DLC. For a game that’s been promoted as a NSFW game, it’s a little strange they decided to lock all the mature content behind a DLC.  [h1]Love Interests[/h1]  Nekopara Vol. 1 has two main love interests.  Chocola - Chocola is Vanilla’s twin sister. She’s the more energetic and cheerful out of all the Minaduki catgirls. She can act quite childish, and hardly ever ends up being upset.   Vanilla - Vanilla is Chocola’s twin sister. In contrast to Chocola, she’s more stoic and calm. She’s happy to do whatever Chocola wants, as she loves her twin sister a lot.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  Most people do tend to buy VN’s for the story, but I believe an exception can be made for Nekopara’s distinct and stunning art style. Even though you do have to pay extra for the NSFW DLC, I would still suggest in buying it in order to enrich your experience! For reference, it took me about 8 hours to complete the game, but I did leave it on auto and waiting for every line to finish before moving on to the next line.

Cat
You don't find cat girls. Cat girls find you.                                        Come on, visual novel devs. The H-scenes are already semi-animated, so up your game already.
A very nice cute vn with moments of heart warming and laughter portrayed with awesome art.
A man has been in a coma for the past few weeks and is now dreaming of talking cats that he has sex with and his sister who loves him. This is one of the best games ever.
Ahhh yessss  Goshujin-sama!!!! o((>ω< ))o
Vanilla and chocola pron arch. All the nekopara games have a pretty generic story formula of sad thing being presented and then just immediately dispelled. There's no real conflict in these stories that last more than like 2 seconds.
The story was plain.I wanted more.It would have been better if there wasn't any incest for no reason.It takes about 2 and half hours to complete it.Since all u need to do is click away,it starts getting boring after some time.Overall its a good game for the price tag.I would rate it a 7/10.
God i love nekos I need to finish the rest volumes so that i can watch the anime thats hopefully will come at the end of this year.  When its airing, it will hype up the fans for sure. cant wait
.
i mean, i dont know why i played this but 10/10
10/10 catgirls good   thank u for making a good catgirl visual novel............
Really wish they didn't make your little sister also crave you sexually, the incestious dialogue is very creepy and unsettling. Other than that, great game. Cute, funny and charming. Art is great and animations are smooth.
very nice. who woulda thunk catgirls could be so cute
Nekopara Vol. 1. Number of hersey: 28 "take responsibility": 2 Art(out of 10): 7 Music: 6 Voice acting: 8 "story":2( circular conversions, contradicting itself, and repeating shit over and over again. As in Bob's car is blue. He's car is blue. The day was nice. Bob drove up in his blue car.)
So Nekopara... a game about cat girls that are underaged and work a shop that its name isn't even well spelt, in the game it is called boulangerie la solei when the correct french wording should be boulangerie le solei. Anyways back on track you have the dude who runs the store (protagonist) that owns these cat girls (thanks Elon look what you have done) at one point he whips out his meat stick and goes at it with a fucking cat girl. Not only that but the tits in this game are very lacking. i found myself narrating the game with friends to make it go by faster. it fucking fun to make memes out of this game. Also before i forget the S*x scenes in this game are very generic. 2/10 bad anime tits
Buy the 18+ DLC too, then you will be immersed in this S-Class Eroge
i see catgirls working in a bakkery i click.  13/10 would eat cake again
bruh
Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots and cats and Boots
10/10 No regrets!
My friend wanted that i buy rocket league.  Bought nekopara vol.1 and 18+ dlc no regretts
An adorable game. Played it through twice for the pg version the first time around and enjoyed the story and how cute the characters were. Cant wait to start the second.      Yes I did get the dlc when it went on sale but that will be a review for another time.
I enjoy it, I won't force myself to hate it because damn. Catgirls are hot
Why do people call this thing a game when all you get to do is reading and reading without any choices or whatsoever
What do I need to say?
Ever wanted to frick a cat?
"Rero rero rero rero rero rero rero rero~" ~ Chocola, Vanilla Coconut
Cute and funny story, nice music, and lovable catgirls. If you love catgirls, then look no further!
Shane Dawson was clearly ahead of his time
NEKOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 10/10 - IGN Very fun game, love it. I love the transitions, you can tell that you will be brought into the next chapter. This game doesn't have much choices like routes in eroge games so mostly you would reading than picking a girl you want to go after, just the story.
very cute, very sensual  10/10   this game cured my depression xx
This game is great. The steam version is not, there are scenes simply cut from the game, of course in the name of 'censorship'. Not that steam isn't full of games with blood, gore, murder, violence, bad language... etc. But sex is a no no, time to CUT scenes of a game, just because of sexual content, and even though the user has stated they are over 18. I'd describe the steam version as a jam doughnut, without the jam, disappointing though still good, could be so much better with the added 'Jam'. /rantover  Edit: Jam added as a DLC :)
Excellent visual novel, far exceeded my expectations. I hope the others are just as good.
Now I see why Elon Musk wants to make cat girls into a real thing GOD BLESS THAT MAN
Playing this game, it felt like I was in paradise... neko paradise.
i have fucked the catwomen, and im scared of the consequences. 10\10 this game is awful
Contains minimal negativity. Chocola & Vanilla's volume.
:JoyOpenEyes:
Don't even ask just play the game you'll enjoy it.
Catgirls=10/10
Great game for the whole family.
My friend gifted me Nekopara Vol. 2 for my birthday when I became 18 years old... Idk why he didnt get me the first volume instead. Well now I'm stuck loving nekopara and I can't get out of it... Need to thank my friend for gifting me this game.
This is so cruel... Eh, if the developers really gave the player the opportunity to make at least some choice. But no, no. No freedom. No different endings. No choice.
One of the cutest and beautiful stories ever made, combines beautiful graphics, animated characters, cute voices and a nice plot, definitely a piece of art.  PD: fully recommend to buy the +18 dlc
4/5 Best in the series... so far
This is not my style of game so i can't really recommended it. I only can say that the sound design is good but that the characters are just really really stupid. If it's not your style of game or you are not interested by easy achievements, pass your way.
First visual novel I've ever played. I love it   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LZjIlc1MHM
y my pp hard
sex
lol
I think this is a good game
good
What the hell. it was a couple bucks.  Why are they so cute.  Wait what, WHY AM I FUCKING THEM.  WAIT WHY DID I PAY FOR THE DLC THAT SHOWS ME FUCKING THEM.  There's obviously no plot or gameplay of value. It's just pretty adorable, and the voice acting and animation quality is absolutely stellar.  Not worth it at all for $10, but pick it up on sale.
I am dissapointed at myself, for even buying the whole collectection. I am ashamed, but I just need my dose of catgirls. One day we will have real cat girls one day.
My friends forced to me to buy this... I gotta say I'm not a huge anime fan but this shit right here is the reason I may end up watching Jojo. I've got the 18+ DLC but I got so invested in the story I can't get hard (or maybe it's just my dissapointment of myself). This is good gaem buy this on summer sale or some shit you won't regret it. All the characters except for the protagnist have japanese voicelines and the catgirls and your sister are fully animated.       Elon-chan hurry up
my cat like this game so much
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Honestly, yeah
The art style is very beautiful, however, the sexualization of characters that looks like children makes it very unnerving to play. The storyline is quite boring.
ty for the boner
I feel like I'm being constantly watched by everyone on my friends list when I play this game. The sheer amount of pressure and anxiety I get is enough to drive a man insane.   Otherwise, pretty good game. 10/10  Vanilla is the goodest catgirl though.
Hehe
Nice ;'))))
epic game for epic gamers
after showing off to friend and people around this game, some shows concerning about how i spending time only one guy who encouraged me to buy this game vanilla chan is love ,vanilla chan is life i would adopt nekos as my daughters in future ~nya~
Nyaaa~~
art is great, scenario is ordinary it gets hard at certain points
Do you want to be in online and know what any weeb plays (visual novel) first?      Nekopara  Yep  Nekopara  What... what you want me to say
It's ok
I luv my neko lolis
Distilled catgirl cuteness!  PROS: This is a rather basic kinetic visual novel, but it plays to it's strength.  The story is coherent and straightforward, and though no end goal is given through the novel, it's the kind of story that doesn't need one.  It's fluff, cutesy and adorable with some emotional substance provided for the characters.  The art is fairly standard, as is the soundtrack, but I did enjoy the main theme, 'Taiyou Paradise.'  CONS: It is a rather basic kinetic visual novel, so the lack of choices may turn a few people off.  Having to pay extra for any sort of H-material seems to be grasping for a bit of extra cash, and feels a little odd.  A key bother, though, is the moving characters during the novel.  The way they dart about has an uncanny valley effect, and just comes off a bit stiff and unnatural at times.  The addition of a 'bounce' feature feels equally confusing.  ACHIEVEMENTS: Another visual novel that really only requires story progression.  Thanks to the style, most will be unlocked with one pass, though a quick start with the languages to round it off.  FINAL: This was a rather adorable experience that one can find enjoyment in, H-scenes or SFW.  It does feel like just adorable fluff in VN form, but it's the type of quick break that was enjoyed over the period of time played, and does leave a positive feeling for the later games to hopefully continue the story in the same charming, adorable light.
Long ago on a chilly winter night, I saw a peculiar sight, a game with catgirls whose pussies seemed tight. I payed and I played all winter day, until I realised may game seemed astray ,for the shower scene ended without the intended, plowing of the cat rear end...ed? I searched and I found a solution so profound, that it shook they very precipice where I can be found. With the patch installed which was free for all I set out to see myself empty my balls into the kitties inner hall. As I gave them the glaze ,to the Ero gods I prayed for granting me such a wonderful daze of euphoria and joy.  (can't think of anything else)  Good game, have the whole series(Didn't get the second one on steam but I do own it) as should you aswell. I really can't think of a better title to get you pumped for the inevitable real life catgirls to grace our us degenerates. We must give thanks to the Ero gods for providing us with such wonderful fruits of degeneracy.   Coconut/10 would pet again.
They captured the various personalities that cats have perfectly in these girls. If you own a cat, you will understand!
had a lot of fun with this visual novel definitely recommended played with the 18+ scenes made it a better experience personally
Great game but titties shouldn't be paid DLC I do not support this business practice so steam Nekopara gets an 8/10
I didn't fuck my cat. I didn't cum on my cat. I didn't put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself I wasn't going to make apology videos after last years thing so I'm just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible.
decent gameplay and physics but not too much to do
BEST  ANIME  EVER !!!!!!!!
.
bruh
A truly worthy title of one of the best triple C games out in the market.  Cat Cam* Cancer  "I see you both as my little sisters or like my daughters.." That escalated well, Masterpiece, 10/10, parents can't know, if you're reading this review, just know that you're a shame for your family just as me, have a nice one.
Dad is a little bit disappointed in me
Is it too late for a refund?
lmao yes
Uh, Yes.
The best game ever
9/10: Could use more flavors with my chocolate and vanilla snack but over all tasty
This fucking game just cheated me out of my money. You don't get everything inside and they basically removed the reason why we downloaded this game
Nekopara.....  It is a Visual Novel It has nice music It has cute Neko's It has Jiggle physics You can pet the Neko's  .....and you can do the sexy.......  But in all seriousness, Nekopara is a great visual novel series which tell the lighthearted tale of a group of Neko friends who take a liking towards the main character. The stories are fun and comedic and their is deep meaning to some of them. The arts style is beautiful with bright vibrant colours and expertly drawn and animated characters and backgrounds.  The MC owns and runs a bakery and is helped by the Neko's. It is a slice of life V.N which tells the story of each character and their connection with the MC and each other, alongside them working alongside the MC helping him run the bakery. It is a nice story to sit down for an evening and read/watch and spend a couple of hours on each episode (Nekopaara Episode 0-4).  Now for the <cough> ADLUT MATURE ULTRA SEXY BIT. Yes this game is typically rated 18 as there is an option to purchase an Adult 18+ DLC which removes certain censors in scenes to show full nude of the characters and in their acts. It also includes additional scenes of the MC ...."lewding" up the nekos if you know what I mean hehehe. But yeah there's that for you ULTRA NEKO LOVERS.  Overall, its a fun game with a nice funny story and lewdness......I approve >_<
i cant look at my cat anymore

Censorship is bad.
You don't get to fuck the protag's little sister  6/10, I guess I'll settle with these cat bitches
You know, at first I thought it was kinda sad for me to play this after my wife left me but after playing I'm happy she did.
Wrote this review for the grand prix. Fun game though.

Holy shizzz, this is Neko Kawaii Madness! Cuteness overload! This game will change your life for the better :P
Ever since my beloved girlfriend left me for big dick f@6607 i have been in a depressed slump for 9 whole years, cruising steam to fill the empty void that is my heart. Steam graciously recommended this GODLY game to me, to my unbeknownst uncultured eyes, i opened this game out of curiosity and stayed for the 5 year old catgirls. Never before have i jerked my dick so vigoriously that i came blood. I want to mix Vanilla and Chocola with my pretty pink ass to make a neapolitan hot steamy mess with fluids leaking everywhere, i will use my horsecock that i bought from baddragon ,com to make their assholes go into shock, after all there is no cock like horsecock. 11/10 best underaged catgirls, i really like the boob jiggle function. That is all thank you
how to hide my recently played???
Great game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This is the ultimate catgirl V/N on steam.  Just buy it already.
After a year and a half and at least four readings, I think it's finally time I reviewed NEKOPARA. While the thousands of meme reviews are indeed quite funny, I figured it would be best for me to put in some serious effort. So then, let me share with you why this series, particularly this first volume, resonates so well with me.  Where do I start? Well, if you've taken a peek at some screenshots, you'll likely come to some easy conclusions. You may think the CGs are plentiful and varied, the backgrounds are high quality, and the sprites are incredibly detailed. Indeed, you'd be right, except for the last bit. You see, NEKOPARA isn't content with mere sprites that you'd see with most other visual novels. Instead, you'll notice that characters are in fact rendered in 3D, but still look very anime-esque. At least, that's the best way for me to describe them. Characters are in constant animation, often moving around in the screen space, with fluid facial expressions provided by the "e-mote" system. If you believe that VNs are too formulaic-looking, NEKOPARA will be a pleasant surprise.  In addition to glorious visual prowess, NEKOPARA also features complimentary sounds. There's a healthy amount of music, and each track does a good job of setting the tone of each moment. The opening theme never fails to get me dancing! Sound effects are numerous as well, and coupled with the visual movements, I find that they do a good job of eliminating the need of many awkward and drawn out descriptions that other VNs might require (though some of them are...well, you'll know when you hear them). As for the voice acting, I don't have any complaints really. I love how even though it's all in Japanese, you'll often hear English words and phrases thrown in nonchalantly. It's charming, really. Everything works together to be a joy for the senses.  As for the story, I'm not exactly sure what I expected. You've likely seen the memes already, and they're undoubtedly part of the drive behind the series' success. That said, NEKOPARA offers more than one might expect at first. At its core, the story is a slice of life with catgirls, which leads to some interesting moments, to say the least. It's about Kashou Minaduki, an aspiring baker who leaves his home and family business to open his own store. He's accompanied by two of his family's (more specifically, his sister Shigure's) catgirls, the carefree and oblivious Chocola, and the cheeky and intelligent Vanilla. These three learn to become an eccentric family-like unit together, all while learning to manage the new store. Overall, there are plenty of humorous and lighthearted moments. Even after several readings, they still manage to get some hefty laughs out of me. Chocola and Vanilla each have their quirks as catgirls, and I think the best moments are when they interact as a duo and show them off. Kashou himself his a bit dense, but I do like him in general. Occasionally though, things can get serious, and a couple times I managed to let a few tears loose. It's silly to think that such a story could pull that off, but maybe it's that very surprise that got to me the most. I won't spoil the ending chapter, but man, that did a number on me! Overall, I found the writing to be very solid, and no doubt much of this is thanks to a great localization. I won't try and proclaim that this volume is literary high art, but it understands exactly what it wants to do and does it very effectively.  Alright, I've managed to avoid it thus far, but it's about time we talk about the naughty bits. Yeah, the very basis of most of the memes. My first reading without the lewd patch was about five hours long. Later on when I finally did install it, I think it was roughly one hour of additional content. There's three scenes in all, and wow do they get intense. This is when the animations go into overdrive, and you may find out that your PC isn't quite up to snuff for them. In fact, if you notice the opening cinematic getting out of sync with the theme, I would recommend turning off those animations. Also, my goodness, those sounds effects are strange. As to the question of if you need the patch, well, it's your call. If you really don't want to participate in that stuff, don't feel pressured to, because it's not necessary to enjoy everything else. But if you're a connoisseur of such content, expect quality. There's a reason everyone talks about it...  I've praised this volume quite a bit already, but I guess I should address some nitpicks. Even though she has some good moments, I don't care much for Shigure. She's just crazy at times. Also, the scene in which all six Minaduki catgirls are present feels a bit crowded, and you don't get to much of a sense of the others until later on. Finally, while I was alright with it, I can imagine some readers may be put off by the intense voice acting, so I could understand if you feel the need to hush or completely mute it. Ultimately though, these are minor complaints, and this is all I could really think of to mention.  Now that I've said all I need to, I can fully recommend NEKOPARA vol. 1 to anyone who might be interested. If you're a veteran of visual novels, it's practically required reading. This was actually one of my first VN experiences, and it absolutely got me interested in the genre as a whole. Fair warning though, it may not be fair to expect other VNs to measure up to this series, because it's just that unique and great. While many of the reviews are humorous and not particularly informative, the overwhelmingly positive status they give does not lie. Unless you're highly averse to these offerings for whatever reason, I can't recommend NEKOPARA enough!
im sorry mom.
me and my cat  approve this game
Great animation and artwork, adorable cat-girls, and a storyline that actually is much better than you might think.  Honestly I have been enjoying it much more than I even thought I would and if you are in the mood for more than just the story grab the +18 DLC and you get a slightly more adult experience along with the interesting story.
Cute story, good OST and very nicely animated characters. A technical bonus, it runs well using Proton too.
Bought only for big anime boobs
Neko girls what more do i have to say?!
(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Solid Read, likable characters, touching dialogue, fantasy themes.  Basically a Japanese Harry Potter.
Those catgirls are too good. Why they not real tho... ;w;"  Edit: Still great.
Good game but theres really too much of fu*king catgirls when you have adult patch
im proud to have this in my library
I really enjoy wasting my life
Absolutely in love with those visual novels 10/10 would recommend every nekopara game tho
very Nice could lower price of dlc but would recommend
10/10 Would trade my dignity for it
Its art that I appreciate
Vanilla or Chocola?  Thats the question.
I can't believe we've done this. Epic Gamer Moment, Major Bruh Moment.   secret message to all tru gamerz [spoiler]Make the hurting stop, I get beat daily for playing this. My family has disowned me I have nowhere left to go. My only posession is a laptop with this game on it. send help.[/spoiler]
I can't believe we've done this.  [spoiler]Probably the most epic gamer moment in history.[/spoiler]
Head patting and more petting.
I can't stand up now
Can't have enough cats
It is in anime visual novel with cute Nekomimi's what more could you ask for?
things goes better when patched the R-18 DLC

Best game recommend more neko maids
the tiddies are a paid DLC but it doesn't matter cuz the story is good salu2
Today on "How I became a degenerate"     I got this game
Good Storyline with some nice anime titties even without the 18+ Dlc it's Great. And with the Dlc i shall give the game a best fap/10. Coconut=GodTier
nice game
a touching story of a man who wants go out on his own, follow his dream, and make cakes  except his cats also want to follow him and his dream  mostly him  more importantly though this has [b]nO HEADPAT BUTTON[/b]  on the plus side you get to take your cat-friends to the amusement park on the downside it leaves the eternal weeb stain on your library  even further is the rules for this world are unclear and vague and the cats are nine months old and i don't know if the harkness test really applies or not but what is important is cashew man is apparently the only fucking guy in existence i guess
Myaah! Master, you pervert!! Just where do you think you're grabbing?!
Catgirs are nice you know?
Bro, somebody hacked my account and used my steam wallet to buy this game. I swear bro, I don't even like this anime stuff that stuff is lame.   Update: They hacked me again and bought the 18+ DLC bro i swear!!
Cute 'Games' like this are good for your heart and soul! ^_^ 10/10 would recommend if you enjoy visual novels. It's well worth it.
Amazing
This has a far better and more in-depth story when compared to vol. 0, although you really should read vol. 0 before starting vol. 1 so that the story makes more sense. The character development is very good and it really makes you care about all of the characters and the activities they get up to. The grammar (in English) is almost flawless and the animations and soundtrack work really well with the vibe, art-style and story that the developers were going for.
It good.
Meet the adorable cat girls "Chocola" and "Vanilla"
What can I truly say about a masterpiece like Nekopara that hasn't been said already? Nothing really.  Best purchase of my life, highly recommend
best 10.3 hours of my life
i had a lot of fun with the fast paced fps aspect of this game. in the sense that you can actually feel what the other player is doing at any given moment. it really gives you a feeling that you're literally connected to everyone but at the same time competing for the most strength and getting the most powerful weapons.  i'd say the tutorial needs a bit of a rework, because when you spawn in for the first time it's always incredibly overwhelming. that happens mostly because anyone can feel anyone's strength at any given moment. in fact this game does have a chat feature but it's not even necessary. you can mostly tell the message of anyone by just looking in their eyes. you can feel what every other player does, has, needs and feels at any given moment. you can react to feeling someone's something any way you want, but one thing is for sure, everyone else will know what you felt in response to that other person's feeling. and it just leads to an endless mindfuck domino of intimate subconscious messages that could not be expressed in a linguistic language   the voice chat experience is absolutely out of this fucking world. you have to hold both ctrl and a to enable speech, thank fuck i changed that in the controls menu. but eitherway that's besides the point. what i'm trying to say is that because this game feels so intimate, talking to other players is an almost sexual experience.  all npc's in this game play more of a guiding role in this game. for example  chocola shows you how to greedily feel everything to the brim vanilla shows you a place to rest when you feel you've felt enough coconut does something related to your kpu settings idfk something like that  i swear to god one time the chocola npc was unavailable, so, with nowhere to access her "shops", some dude asked me for 3 sticks and 1 iron bar and the moment i said "yes" i felt his fucking heart skip a beat, then mine skipped two, and we were eventually in sync. that very moment i swear i turned gay. i turned gay. this fucking game turned me gay.  the most interesting part is that all emotions seem to balance out because of the way all emotions seem to connect and blend into a warm liquid in which everyone can experience everything at the same time.  it doesn't matter what race, height, weight, nationality ... or hell even what gender you are. this game teaches you how to feel love. it connects us as human beings, it throws the harsh laws of evolution out the window. sex doesn't even feel intimate anymore. competition never induces jealousy or feelings of lonliness, it only teases you into oblivion.  the interesting part is that if you start to love a player in this game you can't hide it for a microsecond, because they would immediately feel you, and they would immediately respond back with something (again, subconsciously) and you will respond back with something else and something else and someone else and if they don't reject you then welcome to unicorn world but else you will just get over it and just go look for someone else and immediately fall in love again ^ all of this happens in aprox 0.028 seconds  you can't really feel much pain from the rejection because everything happens way too quickly for your brain to be able to comprehend the negative emotions. that is because negative emotions take thought, but positive ones don't have to  this is what god wanted from us, this is what god was trying to teach us all along by putting us on this world. teaching us that in fact nothing matters, teaching us that suffering (even in the slightest) is not something you just "deal" with, it's something tied to evolution and survival, and when that dies out thanks to technology slowly we still feel it but slowly we instead start to indulge ourselves in it to the point where we are not even anything alive anymore and we just exist as something beyond comprehension  con: a bug i found with using nvidia 3040 gpu sometimes your vision turns black when in a watery place
Yeah, it's an ok visual novel. I'd recommend
10/10 shane dawson approved
I was gay, now I'm not gay
Before you buy this game, have in mind this is a CENSORED version and all the "good" scenes are completely cut out. Apparently there is an 18+ Patch you can buy, but I couldn't be bothered with that so I can't tell you how it works. If you want to play this game for the story (although we know that's not why you're here) or for Japanese practice or something... buy it. Otherwise, be prepared to buy the patch!
nyan~
can be played one handed
every dollar spent on "war on drugs" is a dollar less for genetically engineered cat girls  Just a Reminder
I'll never be the same but it was worth it.
Vanilla > Chocola (Debatable)
Life is finite, but Catgirls are eternal.
cat girl anime tiddies must I say more?
Uhhhh this game's alright. Let me be very clear though, I definitely didn't buy it for the catgirls.
I love catgirls(2).
Fun fact: There's a thing called "R-18 patch". I'm just saying.
I got this after hearing about it online. First, yes, it's ultimately *that* kind of game, so expect that kind of thing in here.  But what makes this worth the price to me - when I could easily find free stuff online - are the sheer depth of the characters. Chocola and Vanilla are absolutely *charming* in their portrayal, emphasized by the skill their respective actresses bring, and they both work wonderfully as natural compliments to each other, each of them making up for the other.  The story is also very charming in itself. Though it is a typical "harem"-style story with an inevitable conclusion, the writing helps bring it to life; Chocola confessing her sadness early on actually tore at me, and Vanilla's mischievous streak had me cackling at times. In this case, it is the journey itself that counts more then the destination, and the journey was enjoyable all the way through!  The supporting cast are also quite good, though a bit lacking in depth currently. Still, I know there's more volumes out there, so I'm sure they'll all get their own screen time.  My one complaint: the graphics are a bit...stiff. It sucks that only one character can seem to move at a time, which makes for some initially confusing moments. Fortunately, the writing is good enough that the confusion goes away quickly after moving to the next couple of sections, but it did detract a bit at times. There also seem to be a few glitches with the speech where you sometimes have to click twice to make the full text appear (a problem if you're not a natural Japanese speaker, as VO is only in Japanese).  Still, none of this was nearly enough to detract from my enjoyment, and I'm looking forward to trying the other volumes in Neokpara soon!  ...Oh, and for those who are new to Graphic Novels: this isn't really a "game", as there's no interactivity beyond what you might get out of an actual book (click to move on to the next sequence, bookmark your spot for later, etc). No mini-games or puzzles or other stuff like that. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING as it allows you to focus more on the store; just be prepared when you come in.
I like this game because their are cat girls in it and cat girls are wicked cute. Like LEGIT. Best organism to walk the Earth (Realizes cat girls aren't real)
god I'm a degenerate.
[h1]How I Feel When Playing This Game[/h1] Chapter 1 (demo) |  (gasp) never seen a catgirl before (º 0 º) Chapter 2-4     |  seems legit... Chapter 5-6     |  NANI ?!?!?! Chapter 7-9     |  Oh~ You Touched My Tralala~~~ Chapter 10      |  me: waiting for Steam sale  [h1]Actual Review[/h1] First time playing a Visual Novel, it has simple operation (just keep pressing M1), great art (no I'm not talking about 18+ stuff here...), joyful storyline with funny but thoughtful jokes, makes me think thrice before keeping pets...  [h1]Rating[/h1] 9.7/10
I wish catgirls were real.
World would be a better place if cat girls were real.
Difficulty level : Hard.
it's got a nice artstyle, voice acting, pleasing ui and great writing, adult content is kinda weird but ok   8.34/10
It's a cute slice of life VN with catgirls and great artwork. The dialogue isn't too cheesy and the music is really great for a visual novel.  Pros: - Cute catgirls - Artwork & music - Yes, this game allows you to pet the cat  Cons: - 18+ mode has to be bought separately
i came for the eroge and stayed for the history. This is the perfect example of a game well done. If you are hesitating, dont. You wont regret it.
we all know what your doing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I thought this was a game about grooming cats
noice
yes
Acceptable price for the story it provides, and character animation is decent.
Sexual Cat Game
Uh oh!
I can practice my shooting skills with this game
If you are into catgirls, you must play it. If you are into slice of life genre, you must play it. Nekopara has set new standard for catgirl visual novels alike!
Elon Musk, make it happen.
good
played it for a bit good game
A creation of the illuminati to lower the birth rates around the world.     Recommended, depended on what you looking for lol
This. This is ultimate happiness. Catgirl jiggle physics is most important. Please do yourself a favour and get the 18+ DLC. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
WITH THIS , JOJO! ,  I REJECT MY SOCIAL LIFE.  10/10 Game.   Fingers are sticky and i don't regret FUCKING my cats.
Ahhh visual novel games.. well.. this one is less a game then basically a full and strictly story Visual Novel. not a bad one though. my only real complaint is the same I have with most. the main char is a moron who cant see the obvious. always clueless, slow on the uptake, and is usually the least interesting thing about the game. rarely is this ever not the case and it shows in varying degrees how much. but that is really my only gripe. as for everything and everyone else. they are supremely entertaining. this guy's little sister is a bloody mastermind. She's gonna be frightening when she is older I'm sure. she might just be my favorite so far. but! definitely recommended whether the lewds brought you here, the story, or both.
nya
You must as well reconsider when was it a good idea to buy this.   So I am.
Why I hate myself Volume 1 - off to a promising start!
pros: one handed gameplay jiggle physics  cons: none
Awesome.
Good Game
LOL. Gotta love some harem.
The game gives you 80 save slots...game of the year.
uwu
Playing NEKOPARA without adult content is like going to a cake shop and not being able to eat a cake. I think It's just pointless and wrong on so many levels, so be sure to get "Adult Only Content" before playing this visual novel game.  If you are into catgirls, you must play it. If you are into slice of life genre, you must play it. If you like your adult scenes animated, you probably know the answer. NEKOPARA is one of most interesting Visual Novels available on Steam - maybe not in the terms on story, but pretty much everything else is done really well. You can't go wrong with this game if you feel like starting your adventure with this genre. The girls are cute, and the visuals are great. Do you need anything else for a game filled with adult user-defined tags? Yeah, I think so too.
I'm a simple man, I see catgirls, I buy. 10/10, buy the dlc if you really wanna "experience" the game.
Thank you for this blessing the lord has given us. 1000/10
You sold me at Catgirls.  All Jokes aside it's a good read.
I thought this was a game about grooming cats
Highly recommend this game. Just be sure to be prepared because this game is dangerous. It'll drain every last drop of your juices till you get infertile
It has a JoJo reference 10/10 absolute masterpiece.
https://youtu.be/q4vPEpFyF5k  The 'owning' of sentient cat girls as pets & companions are not fully explored in this kinetic novel based around pastry shop ownership.  Slow pacing and dry characters also weaken the narrative.
100/10
This game SLAPS
10/10, Is a great allegory for the treatment of African Americans and the American slave trade.No I am not kidding go into the game and try to make connections between the treatment of Catgirls and African Americans it is insanely similar and they didn't do it on purpose.
[h1]Don't waste your money![/h1]  [b]Yep, guys, I bougth this game a long time ago, the game has a lot of fan service and sh!t, but the original version of this game is a HENTAI game, yup, a lot of us love hentai games, but...  Why the game publisher sell us a censored version of this game?, the uncensored version is aviable on Denpasoft website, here too but it's a [f]ucking DLC!  This negative review, why? well, if you buy the R18 DLC you'll find some censored hentai, yup, pixels on the sensitive parts from the sex escenes, hey dev, give us a raw hentai game without censorship! Steam have a lot of games with R18 content with no pixels!, so if you want the R18 game is better go to Denpasoft website.  Of course, the devs pixelated some hentai scenes, but a lot of consumers of this game aren't livin' in Japan! Well, you censor some anime [v]aginas, but it's very natural to an proudly owner of some catgirls [f]ucking them! hahaha, please retire the pixels from the game in the countries where is not prohibited saw some anime [v]aginas!  Of course Denpasoft version has pixels too, but you only pay once to see some hentai not twice like this version.   There's only Japanese, Chinese English, Russian and another ones translations, maybe another translations like Spanish would increase the sales of this game (I speak spanish). [b]
MY FRIEND BOUGHT ME THE GAME OK I DID NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME
Just here to say if they turn you on, that makes you a pedophile. Almost all the catgirls are 1 year old or younger, this has been a PSA from your local Gopnik
>Get R18 dlc >Play with one hand ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  10/10
Nutted in my heart and in my hand!
Shane Dawson's wet dream
wat
thats not milk
very useful tool for studying
if you like this game we can't be friends.
[b]Nekos :3[/b]
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
UPDATE: This game scarred me and I honestly regret playing it, let alone buying it. There needs to be an "INCEST" tag. Can't recommend the game anymore as I found that psychologically horrifying.  Massively disappointed that it's not a kinetic novel nor a dating sim - which may have been my own fault, maybe I misread the tags - but I can't complain about the quality of the game. Adorable art, cute voice acting. I just wish it hadn't gone on sale literally the day after I bought it for full price lol. Not being interactive, I think this game is worth it on sale, but not at full price.
cat
very guud i enjoyed the titters
This game is so cute, even my heart had an erection
nya
beauty at its finest
CHOCOLA VS. THE OTHER CAT IN A PUSAY FIGHT
A game made for Shane Dawson.  Anyways, I am out of socks and lotion.

My discord server bullies me now
you get to fuck the cats
9/10  Really enjoyed it. the animation for incredible for a visual novel. However the 1 issue I had with this game series I have played the rest is that there is only I play through. No branching choices and multiple endings. Found that the only annoyance. Other  would have be 10/10.
Make sure to buy the DLC  Best part is when you fuck them.
Yeah this series is great, I can play with one hand too which helps a busy college student like me do things like write papers, finish equations, eat hot pockets, and pet my cat! <3
ANIME ITS MY LIFE!
Kudos to developer Neko Works for creating such a fantastic visual novel. I was hesitant before I bought the game Nekopara vol. 1. Now I am so happy I did.   1. Very well written story.  2. Very cute and funny characters 3. Game mechanics was very well done and easy to work with. 4. Art work and dialogue went well together. (The curators seem to know much about cats) I have 3 well cared for cats of my own. 5. To mix human and cats emotions well done and very humorous.
yeah its pretty well done
Great set of Visual Novels. Really enjoyed the story on all of these.
Tags: Adventure - VN - Visual Novel Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library  TLDR: Kinetic novel. No choices. Story drags on way too long with wish fullfillment and establishing bonds between characters. Not much fan service without the patch. A lot of catgirl lore.
where can i get the patches for the game?
Actually my second review on Nekopara, had already done one on Neko Vol. 0. Well, what can I say? Once you enter the Neko world you never go back. Thanks to Nekopara now, talking to Neko cats are one of my hobbies, just hopping that my friends won't find out about this.
I got this back before the 18+ content was allowed on steam. I liked it pretty well, it was a fun little story with cute (if troped) characters. Then the 18+ content came out. I decided to give it a go.  Big mistake. Everything was normal for awhile, then "Oh, hey, nipples! Not bad, not bad." Then the first actual sex scene happened. My thought process was something akin to , "Wait...what is that noise? They actually think -that- dialogue is sexy?! The hell is that noise now?! WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT IS BUBBLING?!" It was just gross and moderately uncomfortable to continue. I did go all the way through it in the end, but I won't be doing it again with the mature content installed.   TL;DR - Get the main part. Skip the mature content.

Very cool
qt catgirls UwU
FBI OPEN UP
im never playing this game 1 hour in parents walked on me with one of the girls in a questionable position
very cute game, better than most  story, novels or games, im amused.
my depression is cured
The most erotic treatise on the ethics and legal ramifications of genetic engineering released to date: a mixture of Deus Sex and Nurse Love Addiction, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 will make you think as often as it will make you cum.  10/10 would dishonour my ancestors again.
My mom came into my room and we decided we would play the game from start to finish together, the visual novel had a lot of good plot and we both enjoyed it  10/10, very good
Like :  The story,the characters,the backgrounds.  Ok.So now it's allowed to play the full-H-version through Steam.[The Hentai-Scenes are still censored by mosaic,though]  Dislike : No interaction.It's not really a game,but merely a graphic novel.  Good : in previous versions the game crashed when trying to load from a savegame.This problem has luckily  been resolved.
This is the best visual novel i've ever played. I'm glad i bought this game!!
I sure do enjoy dissapointing my parents
Why did I play this? Why was I so curious? Why am I considering the other games? 10/10
Did Yoou buy the NSFW content? Yes Were you ashamed by the NSFW content? No Would you recommend the NSFW content on top of the base game? Yes Is the base game complete without the NSFW content? It really isn't Are you a degenerate? Ayup  10/10 would fap to catgirls again  nvm theres a sequel so im definitely fapping to catgirls again.
No words can describe the beauty of this game. I have never had a single woman in my life. Now I am drowning in p*ssy. Chocola and Vanilla taste the best. Cinnamon was too spicy, while Coconut was too mild. (Forgive me Coconut, you are still my favorite.) Maple was too sticky, like syrup. Overall, they each have their own unique flavor and scent.  In terms of caring for your catgirl, I highly recommend this website: [url=catgirlcare.org]Catgirl Care Guide[/url]  Pros: [list] [*]Flat is justice. [*]White hair is adorable. [*]R18 patch for your enjoyment. [*]Faceless self-insert protagonist to project your worthless life onto. [*]Will fill you with pleasure. [*]Adorable waiter uniforms. [*]Bisexual polygamous catgirls. [*]The main character is named Cashew. [*]Got an anime OVA. [*]There is a chest bounciness slider. [*]Press P for power. [/list]  Cons: [list] [*]Have to get volume 3 to do the Cinnamon challenge. [*]Will disappoint your friends and family. [*]They will never be real. [*]You will probably lose all non-weaboo friends. [*]You will get into stupid arguments over who is the best waifu with your weeaboo friends. [*]You will begin to have suicidal thoughts as you develop an obsession for this work of art. [*]It is not clear whether this is a game, a work of art, an eroge, or a visual novel. [*]You actually took the time to read this review about catgirls. You knew what you were getting into when you saw the first image, and entered your birthday to view the page. This game is utterly flawless, and will provide you with the satisfaction that only fake 2D girls can provide. Buy the game. [/list]
I hate cats but not these ones ;).
I finally get to have my very own family of Catgirls!  Sweet!  Hope my parents don't find out or i am damned! Also the 18+ is so worth it!  It adds in a final boss that tests your mental strength!  But still, if you did watch the whole thing without skipping even one piece of text, you really need some mental help!  But i did it, i ***ed them 5 times in a row! But now, it's not enough!  I need to screw more catgirls!  Wait, i also did a loli....            I'M GOING TO JAIL!!!
cat
10/10 would disappoint my parent.
l-lewd!
I always play this game when i'm alone in the house, any other visual novel besides eroge is Ok. But nekopara is the exception.
Okay, so there is a lot to unpack here. First of all, if you are looking at this expecting actual game play like if you were playing Monster Girl Quest, welp, I sadly have some bad news for you: *There is literally no gameplay element in this video game*  This software is literally an ecchi anime (or a hentai if you have the 18+ DLC I guess). Whether or not this is a good thing is up to you, but I did not know this when I started this game since, well, I have over 40 different games in my library that I literally don't know what they are, when I got them nor why. This was one of them.   Now don't get me wrong, I purely and simply love hentai and porn in general, but when I buy a game I expect to have at least the simplest of game play elements, even if they are trash, and it is not the case here.  Is the logic behind the intelligence of catgirls and their interactions with humans absolutely fucked in this universe? Yes. Does that mean it's a bad anime? No.  I would recommend this game to a person that is mentally degenerate and is ready to accept the fact that they are masturbating to porn of Catgirls. If you are not ready to accept that, don't get this game.
easiest way to disappoint friends and family
Many Koreans want to try this work, but they are having a hard time because of lack of translation. Hangulization will help both developers and gamers.
I'm having issues with stray cats in our place thanks to this

dissapointment: the original
It was pretty good.
Siopao
Good game, love the soundtrack, can't say anything bad about it... except 1 thing. Why is the adult content DLC not either free or at a big discount for those that already own the game? That content is its original intended form upon being released to the public, glad it finally made it to steam, but because that was how it was originally intended it should be free or at a reduced price for people that own the edited "safe" version.
I liked the bouncy anime tiddies
If you enjoy nekos and the ability to adjust the bounciness of the characters chests, then.... you're in the right spot. If you stumbled upon this by accident.... google it first.... Coconut is ultimate waifu <3
don't getme started on this master piece of a videsual novel.
It turned out to be a good buy,  Although the plot may seem simple, It has its emotional and fun moments.  In the end it will generate a good feeling :)
Cute neko girls with adorable personalities, what more do you need? :) 10/10! Already a big fan of this series and will be getting volumes 2 and 3!
AUUUUUGH AUUUGH -meow- AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH YEESSSS  I CAME 35 TIMES WITHIN PLAYING THE FIRST 2 MINUTES OF THIS GAME. HELP, MY TABLE IS A CANVAS FULL OF WHITE MARINARA AND ME MUM IS COMING HOME IN LIKE 5 MINUTES. THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE LIKE BEAR SODOMY.   Also, Happy Valentine's Day.
I play it for the plot 10/10
Mom, dad. I am sorry. Your son is a disappointment, but atleast he is a happy one.  Cured my depression, but the Catgirls are so sweet that I now have diabetes.
THE ONLY PU55Y I'D EVER NEED ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) SEASON 1      or more like i'd ever get :'))
Bought thinking this thinking that that it would be wholesome anime but got bobs and vegeen instead, I regret having this on my library now knowing what this is. 10/10.
world cold, cat girl hot
As a visual novel, nekopara is pretty solid and looks great, nice and cute character design, enjoyable soundtrack and a easy to follow story.   For anyone who doesn't know, this "game" it's not exactly that, you don't have any kind of power over the characters you are watching, since visual novels only focuses on showing you a story, kinda like a book or a novel, but they give you soundtrack, scenarios, character design and voice acting, so you won't have a lot of fun unless you really like the story behinf it.  Talking about the story, it's a pretty simple but cute one, that's why I would recomend anyone who likes slice of life anime and that kinf of stuff to buy this game, so you can sit down with a nice cup of coffe and watch those cute catgirls going around and doing cute things.  Finally, in case you haven't noticed yet, this game contains 18+ material (now though, there was a steam actualization that contained all the 18+ content for this game, when it was originally released those scenes were censored and did not appear in the game, now it's in there so... enjoy them), this scenes were not really important for the story but you can see another side of the catgirls you like, o the ones you dislike, in case you do, and I think anyone playing this game should see them.   To sum it up, this is not a game, it's more like reading a novel with cute anime catgirls and voice acting, with some lewds scenes and a happy feeling sorrounding every scene, if you feel lonely I recomend you to buy it so you can feel that warm feeling that you can't get in real life.
no tiddies ›:(
I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Chocola. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Chocola pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Sayori create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
Pretty good story but I would only pick it up when it's on sale since it's not that long.
Literally the greatest game I have ever played in my life, made me tear up so many times and even cry when it was over. When the credits rolled, I actually stood up and applauded. My life has been complete.  (THIS IS A JOKE THIS GAME IS GOD AWFUL)
There is no number to rate this masterpiece.
While playing this game, my roommate worried for my life, as the agonizing noises coming out of my room were plentiful. The whole time playing this, I just felt like a bad human being, but YouTube beckoned that I finish it.  This game fulfills four kinks: 1) Bestiality 2) Incest 3) Hebephilia 4) Slavery It gets away with it by slyly claiming it's none of the above through technicalities, but seriously, you have sex with you CATgirl DAUGHTERS as they are going through PUBERTY, and they can't leave the house without you or really work legally because catgirls don't have basic civil rights, despite being sentient and capable of intelligent thought.   Had to hang a cross above my computer to still get into Heaven. Also, you don't make any choices or impact the game, meaning it's a Powerpoint, not a game.  1/10
One hand support
Honestly I don't know what to say except for... CATGIRLS BOIIIIII. If that's not enough to convince you than I don't even know anymore
my god did i lose my one chance in life
I think I have a problem
10/10 would nut again
Good FPS game
tbh, the way the "cat girls" are handled seems inhumane, but thats not what were here for. Lock you door.
M-Mr Officer. Wait a second. I s-swear I didn't know. Mr Officer you've got to believe me. I didn't see the Mature tag. Wait. NO. MR OFFICEERRRR.
what a great time to be alive
i enjoy playing the game :) i want more nekopara games :D or the anime to come out :)
don't confuse this game with a visual novel: there are no roots, you can't choose anything. it just goes as it is, without any interraction, and the story is just meh, and all the hentai stuff is censored. not sure why it has so much good reviews, but to each their own I guess. most achievements you can get just by enabling the auto mode.  the language ones are misplaced: you pick one language and get an achievement for the other one.
Boring
Cool game, lots of Neko! It is important to me :D.  jerk off so good. Vanilla and Chokhal top of course. Horny testmodel 10 out of 10
I've disappointed my family by getting this game. It's worth
Drawings: 10/10 Story: 9.5/10 Voice: 8/10 18+ content: 9/10 no flame
vanilla and chocola melting in my mouth if you know what i mean :D
Bought the series to tease friends on discord. Left the game on in the background and I couln't refund it before... Fuck
Easy and fast achievements.
this is why I can't look my father in the eye  11/10 not the favorite chikd anymore
Cute neko girls...Thats all you need to know  (buy the 18+ update it makes it like 100x better)

Damn good! Especially Chocola

A gripping story about the horrors faced by the Chinese in Japanese occupied Nanjing in the weeks folowing it's capture.
How to sex a cat in the form of a visual novel. You can also practice reading Japanese since it has a dual language option.

You have to pay to get some of that catgirl puss puss action  0/10
Yep, they're catgirls alright
This is the best game of all damn time, I loved the characters and the story is just amazing, I personally think the best character was the food stand CatGirl that was an MLG gamer and had slain 3 freeloaders and blew the hobo on the side of the street. This makes Final Fantasy 15 look like Cat shit with its top of the line 4k graphics or should i say furr-k. I personally believe that you all should play this with your children in your room and your wives because you have to be a Chad to know what is up enough to buy this game. My Aigis Toaster left me and took the kids. This is nothing but worth your time as a alpha creature of society. My friends that I have think im really cool for owning this game series. Undertales story has nothing on this. There should be more catfights though, so in the end I give this socially accepted masterpiece a 9/10, not enough catfights. also RoboFortune didnt make a cameo so there were no robot catgirls, they missed out on a golden oppertunity, the nude patch while I do not own is highly suggested, because you get to see your favourite characters in their full glory. The music for the game is a masterpiece of orchestral art, I came into this right after playing persona 3 and I did not hear the word baby once in song lyrics which is very good. My dick is raw and looks like a dogs, my balls are blue and its all thanks to you. i wonder if chocola would love a jew, prolly not tho, theyre really ew. vanilla is the best character ive ever seen the character development on her was mwa, si magnifique. Chocola was good but not good enough to match with Vanilla. i own 6 body pillows of all the catgirls.
wholesome enjoyable game for the whole family.
Stress Reliever, 10/10 MUST BUY DLC
A great story to learn about Neko's/Cat girls :3
Nutted.
bruh
u know i was pissed when i first played this game since it had no sex and i was led to believe there would be sex but after illegally pirating the version with sex it was great 10/6.7.
Vol.1 was great, the story with Chocola and Vanilla has great intense but funny moments in the story. Chocola is so far my favourite character in the story of NekoPara and I look forward to the other characters. This game had humour and emotional backstory moments which I personally liked. Can't wait to try out Vol.2
I thought I wasn't going to like Nekopara but it really is a cute and heartwarming story. I still feel pretty weird for playing it though but that's because the catgirls are basically the main character's sisters or even daughters. Even so, I truly recommend nekopara for anyone interested.
10/10 would nut again
Expectation: Typical eroge with dumb plot I wouldn't give a crap about. Reality: I cried like a b*tch during the Chocola park bench scene.
this game is a shuttle bus straight to hell and i am merely a passenger
Cat Girls
Just buy it
Cat Girls <3
Who dosent like catgirls?
10/10 would get arrested by FBI again.
This game has a really good PLOT.
Pros:  -Horny Cute Cat Girls -Very Well Drawn -Relaxing Music  Cons:  -If You Like Guys, This Game Isn't For You Until Further Mods Are Developed. -Story Is Mediocre And Falls Apart Within Mere Minutes -Forces One Handed Gameplay -You're Entire Family Must Never Know You Own This Game
This game is an masterpiece. The true and only God made this. Its a treasure for humanity and should be kept safe at all cost.
its a cat
F*CK IT!!! 18+ DLC!!! ANOTHER EA MEME???
A story to rival the whole Metal Gear series, complete with elaborate twists and turns such as when [spoiler] Vanilla fuses Chocolate's severed arm to replace the arm she lost battling Cashou for the empty shampoo bottle, becoming Punished Vanilate Desu Senpai [/spoiler].   If you play games for their plot, you can't miss this thrilling suspense VN.
Okay, I think it's time for some real talk: It was mentioned in the story that Chocola and Vanilla are only 9 months old, and they are about 12~ years old in human age. Knowing this, we can safely assume that a 1 year old catgirl is around the human age of 16, and you know what 16 year olds do? That's right! They get drafted into the army.  These catgirls' military value is astonishing. They turn from an infant into a well developed human being who is completely capable of speech in mere 12 months. Not only that, but judging from this quick growth I can guess that even their reproduction rate is similar to felines, so before getting sent to the frontlines they can even produce a couple of offsprings, who can get trained and sent out the following year aswell, only growing in numbers.  Besides that, even on the field they have their advantages, being more agile than normal humans, and the potential to exploit their looks, because no man in their right mind would ever shoot an adorable cat girl.  Wake up mankind, these creatures aren't our salvation, but supersoldiers, who bring our undoing, AND NO ONE REALISES TH- ...oh right ...the review  It's about cute cat girls saying "Nya~" and such, so go for it I guess, it's pretty wholesome.
yeah well there was no porn and that made me pretty sad like seriously why would i play the game without the porn for the amazing story? alright sheesh give me a refund finished the game in 33 minutes or something so i follow the guidelines
Nekopara is set in a world where Elon musk-sama put all his money towards cat girl research  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
As the great Master of Hentai I herby declare that this game, Nekopara Vol. 1, is a must play for all men of culture. -HentaiMaster237  Pros: Cute Catgirls Beautiful Graphics Great Soundtrack Decent Story Easy to Play With One Hand  Cons: 18+ Content for $9.99 Being Put on a FBI Watchlist Dishonoring my Family  Rating: 8/10
Vol 1 follows chocola and vanilla's story and how they started working for the cafe. It was a very heartwarming VN that I thoroughly enjoyed. There are 18+ scenes that can be bought, but I believe the game can be enjoyed without them.
Amazing game for christmas ! One hand review
Saw Nekopara on sale for 5 bucks. Figured 'what the hell, I have low standards and 50 dollars from christmas'. Figured at worst it would be stupid but cutsy catgirls with probably no failing routes.  It's not a game. There is no gameplay. None. No choices. No routes. There's a breast physics slider but not an interesting character in sight.  I have purchased games my computer physically cannot play, and THIS is the only thing I've ever had refunded. Don't even buy this as a joke it will just encourage more products like this to be made.
A very adorable VN that I highly recommend. You're a simple guy who wants to run a bakery, and before you know it, you got a bunch of catgirls around you (and a little sister who may or may not have an unhealthy obsession with you). Voice acting is amazing, soundtrack is great, and as the description of the game says, it's quite the cat paradise.
This game ruined my life but i love it
NYANYANYA!!!!!!
cat girls.
Imo it is best game VN you can get and well-made. The story involves around Choco and Vanilla, The achievement is not that hard. All you have to do is read and absorb into the game(keep reading and find out what happen).
pure art.  hehehe :)
First of all, I have to come out and say that Metal Gear Solid was the previous titleholder for the Solid Snake crown. With the creative boss battles and innovative style it was well worth replaying over and over despite the naysayers who complain about its length. After all, the same thing can be said for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty with its incessant Codec conversations and movies. Strip away MGS2's story and there's a pretty short game there as well. As for its story itself there's little of interest unless you really want to spend a couple of late, smoky nights going over the details and putting all the pieces together, and they do fit together. While that's kind of interesting if you want a pleasant mind rutting, it was far from fun to watch a game eat itself.  Still, the one thing that MGS2 did right, fantastically right, was take the gold standard of stealth espionage action from MGS and update it beautifully for the current generation. The graphics were amazing to look at and with the new sets of moves and details to dig into, gamers kept going back again and again for more to try out a situation in a different way or collect all of the dog tags they could get. It was so slick and pulled off so well that it even helped the Metal Gear RAY battle go down nicely, or at least be stomached.
This game cured my depression
It's about now that I realise I have to really stop buying Humble Bundles.
no
This game is awesome. I love the story and the cute cat girls.
Cute Nekos.... Jiggle Physics.... Can be played with one Hand.... What else to say.... <Smirk>
i really enjoyed watching how my lover fucked my little sisters thank you
Without the Adult DLC, there is death by moe aplenty. It made it all the more difficult to resist cute here. So anyone who is more sensitive to cuteness are better be ready. The later volumes include the e-mote petting system; simple, but may recommend the whole bundle for the story. May or may not be good to just sit, relax, and watch/read, depending on where you are.  Adult DLC is if you want dessert on the side. Just remember that the series has the minimum requried censorship standards. Either way, whatever floats your root beer float. Could use a DLC bundle or a full collection bundle to give the offer some accentuating spice to this recipe.
buy when on sale it's ok too.
this game blows.
Questions are for the Faithless
Sorry mom.
um... cats cats cats....?
Great compatibility for one handed play.  10/10 would nyah again.

Best RPG I've ever played. 10/10 I could already feel my hp being healed.
NEKOPARA Vol. 1  + Good Story + Good Artstyle (love u Sayori) + About 10 hours + Chocolat & Vanilla + 4 +18 Scenes (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) + Cute Nekos + (Smash that P Button)  (btw the OVA is really not worth)
*Visible Confusion*
Boring, no choices, and very uncomfrotable. Also censored.
I give this 10 out of 10 nyas
I fucking hate catgirls, I hate anime, but i had fun playing this with my boy Kevin, absolute unit, loved catgirls, too bad he died in Nam...
cute, great cats and has the best 2 in it
Highly recommend the r18+ patch. Nothing else then that! Game is purrr-fect.
Cat girls. YES
Adorable very loving cat girls, a great story, lots of heavy petting, cute meows, and another reason you need headphones in your life.
Pretty good. Get's kinda boring after a while.
I SWEAR I ONLY PLAYED THIS FOR THE STORY!
To enter the dark realm and never return

Mediocre cat porn 3/10
Gay game but good
Great ride :D  Nekos :3
I hate this
I came, I saw, I came.
Strictly for seasoned veterans of Grand Strategy games, this game is BRUTALLY difficult. I would recommend watching about 5 or so hours of tutorial videos before starting. You play as Cashew, the worlds most oblivious man who has been sprayed with some kind of ultra pheromone that attracts genetic cat-human hybrids. You must resist these freaks as they advance on you as much as possible, failure to do so will result in the bad ending where our hero Cashew ends up mesmerized by the evil Chocola and Vanilla, who have their way with him. If you think you have the skills to get to the good ending, and appreciate a game where almost every choice results in faliure, then by all means give it a go. However in my 20 hours of playing I have still yet to ward off those mutants, no matter what I do it always seems to result in the bad ending. Good luck!
I don't normally play third-person shooters but this is by far the best one that I've played.  EDIT: free badge
C A T
Worth it for the artwork alone. A decent slice of life story with some tear-jerking moments, and lots of anime-style comedy.
Wholesome fun for the family.
I like nekos
It's Nekopara... what else do you need to know? Just buy and play it already! It marks the beginning of catgirl overload \(-ㅂ-)/ ♥ ♥ ♥
NEKO PANTSU! NEKO PANTSU! Nyan~!♥
Came for advice on how to run a business, ended up having sex with my dogs and sister. Great game!
boobs are always a plus :D
every dollar is spent on war but not on genetically engineered catgirls! xd
Chocola is love. Chocola is life. I don't care about what what you think &  I don't care about your feelings. Chocola is Best.  I spent 128 hours of my life on this.... what am I doing with my life ...
I shouldn't have enjoyed any of this and i'm ashamed of myself that I did.
Nice cats many wowz
Has a breast jiggle option  10/10           But seriously now, this a very lovely VN. Highly recommended.
VERY NOICE
NEKO-NEKO Install patch and enjoy
I love neko girl
Please stop calling me a lesbian. It doesn't count if the girls aren't real.

It's not as good as my dad told me it was, but it's pretty decent.  ...Just sucks that now I know why my dad took our cat with him when he ran away.
catgirls
This is flat out bad.  - If you want a game with adult content, there's nothing besides the characters' boobs wiggling when they move and one censored image. - If you want a cute, funny story, you'll only get themes of incest and pedophilia wrapped up in a bland and tedious plot that begs to be skipped through. - If you want a visual novel where you make choices and see different outcomes, there is zero interactivity here. No dialogue choices, no decisions to make. It's one linear story.  I'm confused how this product has positive reviews, because it doesn't deliver on any reason you'd want to play it. I only hope I can save someone else the trouble by reviewing. Do not buy!
my parents aren't proud :(
Basically hentai,
How to make Vanilla Cake  INGREDIENTS 1 1/2 c. sifted cake flour 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 c. unsalted butter 1 c. sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract 1/2 c. whole milk   INSTRUCTIONS Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat an 8-inch cake pan with butter and dust with all-purpose flour. Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Beat in the butter one heaping 1/4 teaspoonful at a time, using an electric mixer set on low speed, until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Beat in the sugar a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture resembles fine damp sand. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla and milk, and beat on medium-high, just until blended. Do not overbeat. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean—30 to 35 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Un-mold and cool completely. Ice with Browned-Butter Glaze.

When I was a little boy, I visited my father in the hospital. He was in and out of conciousness, but while he was relatively lucid he told me that I had to grow up quickly and teach myself how to be a man. He told me that, although it was going to be difficult, I would have to become the kind of person that he always knew I could be and make both him and my mother proud. He said that I needed to learn how to value my life and use my time to discover for myself what was, and was not, important to me. Two days later, he passed away... Now, ten years later, I'm sitting at my computer spending hours reading a VN about a guy who wants to f@ck genetically engineered catgirls while operating a bakery... I guess what I'm trying to say is: I DID IT PAPA! YOUR BABY BOY DUN DIDDIT! Even though he's no longer with me, I like to think he's looking down at me, alone, sitting at my computer and resting easy in the knowledge that I took his advice to heart. 13/10 would make tastless and long-winded joke about my dead father again.

Very adorable catgirls 10/10

the waifus are good, but the 18+ patch is sold seperately. dont buy the steam version unless you know how to pirate the 18+ version and use it to patch your steam version.
The lore is getting pretty deep after 3k hours
Try press "P" keyboard button while playing it
i like it
yes
hands down winner of the best alternate history award
The cats are cute. It is relax just watching cats.
I don't always review games, but when I do, it's because they are awesome.
LOVE THIS <3
Cats
A solid first entry for the Nekopara saga. The silly dialogues and (optional) nsfw are really well done and the VN was overall enjoyable even though it did drag on for a bit longer than i would have liked it to.  The E-mote tech they use to animate the sprites is great and i would personally like to see something of the sort in every VN i play, it adds more life to the characters [spoiler] (It's also awesome for the nsfw scenes) [/spoiler] .
It is a great game to just sit back and relax while enjoying the story; especially if you want to take a break from intensive games that requires keyboard smashing. I also really love how cute Vanilla and Chocola are.
Dota 2 — компьютерная многопользовательская командная игра в жанре multiplayer online battle arena, разработанная Valve Corporation. Является независимым продолжением карты-модификации DotA для игры Warcraft III. Dota 2 работает по модели free-to-play с элементами микроплатежей.  Разработка игры началась в 2009 году, когда компания Valve приняла на работу основного разработчика DotA — IceFrog, а летом 2010 года подала заявку на регистрацию этой торговой марки. 13 октября 2010 года на игровом портале Game Informer игра была анонсирована к выходу в 2011 году. 15 августа 2011 года в официальном блоге был опубликован трейлер к игре. Dota 2 вышла в июле 2013 года после того, как два года находилась в стадии бета-тестирования.  Изначально Dota 2 была выпущена на игровом движке Source, после чего в 2015 году была портирована на Source 2, став первой работающей на нём игрой. В Dota 2 предусмотрена возможность создавать пользовательские режимы игры, оформление карты и косметические предметы для героев, после чего добавить их в Dota 2 при помощи Steam Workshop. Dota 2 является одной из наиболее популярных игр в Steam и получила в целом положительные отзывы критиков за игровой процесс, качество производства и сохранение положительных сторон своей предшественницы. Среди основных недостатков игры была отмечена сложность обучения.  В игре принимают участие две команды по пять человек, каждая из которых имеет собственную базу на карте. Все игроки управляют одним из героев, обладающих уникальными способностями и различными стилями игры. Побеждает команда, разрушившая главное здание противника (англ. Ancient).  Dota 2 является активной киберспортивной дисциплиной, в которой профессиональные команды со всего мира соревнуются в различных лигах и турнирах. Премиум-турниры по Dota 2 имеют призовые фонды в миллионы долларов, не раз становившиеся крупнейшими в истории киберспорта. Самый крупный турнир по игре — The International, ежегодно проводимый Valve на стадионе Ки-арена в Сиэтле. Каждый сезон Valve также организует The Major. Крупные профессиональные турниры по Dota 2 транслируются на видеостриминговых сервисах, иногда набирая свыше миллиона зрителей одновременно. Людей, играющих в Dota 2, часто называют «дотерами». В игре участвуют две команды по пять человек. Одна команда играет за светлую сторону (англ. The Radiant), другая — за тёмную (англ. The Dire). Каждый игрок управляет одним персонажем, который называется героем. Герой может получать опыт для повышения своего уровня, зарабатывать золото, покупать и собирать предметы, которые усиливают его или дают дополнительные способности. Каждый игрок постоянно получает небольшое количество золота от своей базы, а также зарабатывает небольшие порции золота за убийство вражеских существ и большие — за убийство героев. Команды рассредотачиваются по линиям, на которых происходит борьба с вражескими героями и отрядами крипов (англ. creeps) под управлением компьютера, которые каждые полминуты появляются на базах команд. Цель игры — уничтожить главное здание на вражеской базе. Разработчики игры внесли ряд нововведений и улучшений в игровой процесс по сравнению с оригинальной игрой:  Поддержка переподключения (если случился разрыв соединения, можно вернуться в течение 5 минут, если это не сделано — игрок получает низкий приоритет поиска игры). Возможность поставить паузу в игре нажатием одной кнопки. Встроенный голосовой чат. В игре существует разделение игроков по территориальным зонам (в данный момент их четырнадцать: западная и восточная Европа, восток и запад США, Южная Америка, Россия, Индия, Южная Корея, Юго-Восточная Азия, Австралия, Чили, Перу, Дубай и Южная Африка), но при желании игроки могут играть в любой из этих зон. Проблема с задержками и лагами решена сведением к минимуму задержки между серверами и оптимизацией сетевого кода. Красочное, чистое и понятное визуальное представление действий. Доступны компьютерные боты с настраиваемой моделью поведения в виде сложности, которые могут играть вместе и/или против игроков; Продвинутая система повторов, присутствуют как обычные возможности, в виде перемотки и камеры от разных персонажей, так и возможность закладок, просмотр графиков, коллективный просмотр и многое другое. Также повторы будут храниться в Steam Cloud, что позволит игрокам не беспокоиться о потере повторов и о переносе их между разными компьютерами. Возможность присоединиться к любой незакрытой игре в качестве зрителя. Возможность быстро и легко настроить горячие клавиши. Наличие обучающих заданий, которые объясняют новичкам основы игры. Возможность просмотра информации о нанесённом уроне убитому игроку. История серии игр Dota началась в 2003 году с Defense of the Ancients (DotA) — пользовательской модификации для игры Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, созданной разработчиком с псевдонимом Eul. Дополнение для Warcraft III под названием The Frozen Throne было выпущено позже в том же году. Модификации серии Defense of the Ancients для нового дополнения соревновались в популярности. Наибольший успех имела DotA: Allstars, разработанная Стивом Фиком с псевдонимом Guinsoo, и Фик совместно с его другом Стивом Месконом создали официальный сайт сообщества Defense of the Ancients, а также компанию DotA-Allstars, LLC. Когда Фик в 2005 году прекратил работу над DotA: Allstars, его друг с псевдонимом IceFrog стал геймдизайнером игры. Популярность Defense of the Ancients значительно возросла, модификация была одной из самых общеизвестных в мире, а к 2008 году стала киберспортивной дисциплиной. В мае 2009 года в результате ссоры с Месконом IceFrog открыл новый сайт сообщества по адресу playdota.com.  Интерес Valve к обладанию Defense of the Ancients начался, когда несколько опытных сотрудников компании, включая дизайнера Team Fortress Робина Волкера, стали поклонниками модификации и активно в неё играли. Valve связалась с IceFrog по электронной почте с намерением узнать о его дальнейших планах по поводу игры, и впоследствии наняла его для руководства над разработкой продолжения DotA. IceFrog впервые объявил об этом в октябре 2009 года в своём блоге. Dota 2 была анонсирована на Game Informer в октябре 2010 года. Объявление о предстоящем выходе привело к резкому подъёму интереса к игре и вызвало перегрузку и отказ серверов Game Informer.  Название «Dota» было заимствовано Valve из акронима оригинальной модификации как наименование недавно приобретённой франшизы. Сотрудник компании Эрик Джонсон утверждал, что название обозначает понятие игры, так как используется в повседневной речи, и не является акронимом. Вскоре после анонса Dota 2 Valve подала заявку на товарный знак с названием Dota. В 2011 году на Gamescom глава компании Гейб Ньюэлл прокомментировал это, пояснив, что товарный знак был необходим для разработки продолжения с уже легко узнаваемым названием. Сделав название Dota общественным достоянием, Фик и Мескон зарегистрировали противостоящий товарный знак «DOTA» от имени DotA-Allstars, LLC, впоследствии ставшей дочерней компанией Riot Games с августа 2010 года. Вице-президент Blizzard Entertainment Роб Пардо сходным образом заявил, что название DotA принадлежало сообществу игроков модификации. Blizzard приобрела DotA-Allstars, LLC от Riot Games и в ноябре 2011 года подала возражения против Valve, ссылаясь на право собственности Blizzard как на Warcraft III World Editor, так и на DotA-Allstars, LLC, в качестве достаточного основания для претензий на владение всей франшизой. Конфликт был разрешён в мае 2012 года; права на коммерческое использование товарного знака «Dota» было сохранено за Valve, при этом было разрешено некоммерческое использование названия третьими лицами.  Ранней целью команды разработчиков Dota 2 была адаптация художественного стиля Defense of the Ancients к игровому движку Source. Названия сторон — «Стражи» (англ. «The Sentinel») и «Плеть» (англ. «The Scourge») — были заменены на светлую (англ. «The Radiant»)

I WANT THIS IN ENGLISH DAMN IT !!! GIVE US A ENGLISH DUB !!
cats
The good shit!
I don't know why this game is labelled as "Story Rich". There is no story at all. Just a guy who lives with catgirls going through his daily life. The characters are simple and bland and the catgirls are not very amusing. Though I haven't finished the game yet, I'm pretty convinced that things won't be getting any better in the later chapters.   Not worth the money, nor the time. It only has nice visuals; some sort of album version would have been more fitting than turning this into a "Visual Novel". And it did have japanese voice-acting, but they weren't particularly amazing and fit the annoying characters well.   The music was a bit loud and a little repetetive and obnoxious.   Edit: I finished this Kinetic Novel (there's no choices to make, so it's not a visual novel), and it's more boring and even less meaningful than a lame slice-of-life anime can get.  The only character in the Kinetic Novel who was somewhat likeable was the main character's sister, who had romantic feelings towards him (though she wasn't forceful and the main character brushed the occaisional weird comments as jokes).   TL;DR: Why does this game have an overwhelmingly positive rating if it's no good? Because of the people who bought it with the R18 patch for just the adult content.
This stuff is really creepy.
This is the most cutest thing i've ever played. 100/10
*pat pat* Yesssss
Good.
Has a gripping story I felt very invested
The nekogirl species are something only people with refined tastes in visual novels and anime as a whole would enjoy. normies avoid at all costs.
I'm a pride for my family.   XD
CAT GIRL IZ NOT FOR MASTURBATE :<
biubiubiu.
fuckin' thicc
Aight... How did he managed to end up non-stop fucking 2 katze grills 3 episodes straight, without even giving a single shit about his dream of opening his cafe?!
nekopara is one of those games where you can just sit back a relax and just click your mouse and read what they are saying its a good game if you just want to relax and its a break from fps
Very, very nice game, and somewhat cheap too, I warn though: No gameplay, except maybe clicking to pass through dialogue and pressing P. You'll see why ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) -7 hours long, which is cool -Catgirls (I dont need to explain) -Kinky ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) -Story is kinda lowkey bad (But it's alright it, gets better in later games, and the story is not the main attraction)  So yeah, its good, go waste your hard earned money from your mom's credit card into this, she will NOT BE DISSAPOINTED Pinky Promise
Catgirls
Degenerate anime
me: *buys an 8400 and 1070Ti also me: *buys nekopara :D
deez NUT
Great for a loner like me
Uh oh...
I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes adorable anime cat-girls.  It is exactly what it looks like.  A visual novel about cat-girls who work as maids in the player's bakery.  Most of the game is very cute and friendly, but there are scenes of an adult nature. If you aren't into anime cat-maid nudes, don't worry, you can click through these few scenes very quickly and just ignore that aspect of the story quite easily.  Truly beautiful background art, and extremely adorable character art. This is one of the few visual novel series which make me really feel attached to the places and characters in it.  No glitches or technical issues. No/few errors in language or continuity.

Cats are good. Good game, 10/10, would buy again.
Cat girls. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  That's pretty much all you need to hear.
Nya,kawaii 2.0)^_^
This is a heaven game for all of the male.
chest bounciness 100%
Gripping story, Interesting characters. What more is there to say! This game is truly a masterpiece. 11/10
family friendly content
Catgirls are life
Highly recommend!  This game is full of cuteness and nekos. Is there really anything else needed to be said? If your a neko fan PLAY THIS GAME!  But I also recommend the *coughing loudly* patch.
papa johns nigga
Yes
A good game, shame it only had the two girls and the fuzzy Japanese censorship. I like how you can go back to the interesting scenes through the Extras menu at the end. You have to pay extra for the H patch.
Perfection
Not going to be praised for this in any case... As a meme, it's understandable, and the sprite animation is great even without that P key :D The art is wonderful, that bakery though... large enough, unlike it's stated in the text. The soundtrack is average, even though I like the opening. The plot is really the problem, it's disappointingly silly. Only the last chapter before the ending has a kind of conflict, the rest are incredibly cheesy, yet not that absurd to be funny. Given that this novel has been around for several years, and all the art (including the well-known animated scenes) may be easily found on Google, I somewhat regret giving my time to the story that lacks any variety of emotions.
I just got to say that this game is an amazingly done game to the point that you can even play it with one hand, very good while the other is prepccupied. Marvelous game

社保
it's a great VN...
So um you know valve allows adult content now so release R18+ patch ??????????????? :)))))))))))))
I have no will to live anymore, but i recommend this.     Its extra fun playing it in class and trying not to get caught : ^)      I sold my soul to the devil in exchange for trading cards 10/10 would do again
Okay this is a honest review of Nekopara Vol.1 and the observations i made playing this Japanese "masterpiece". To start off, i thorougly cringed and laughed playing this game, specially from chapter 4 onwards, now, i definetely don't recommend buying this game (i didn't personally) if you have any of the following things : Ethics, a life, a will to live. Let's start with the key components about Nekofuckingpara [b] OUR MAIN LEAD (harem protagonist) [/b] ご主人[master]-sama as refered to by his slaves or " Kashou " by normal people standards, this dude is an outright pedophiliac and zoophiliac to every extent. Now i'm going to be honest here, this dude being out in society is a danger for everyone, he doesn't only at first bang his SLAVES, yes, his SLAVES; because he is the OWNER of the two humanoid catgirl sex dolls ; he first bangs them for 'HEALTH REASONS', convinced that he's doing the right thing. Then he bangs them for 'love', It sounds like this dude hasn't even had a good nut for the last decade of his entire life. Remember the 'health reasons' pedophiliac sex? We'll get to it right away. [b] FILLER LOLI IMOUTO WHO WANTS TO BANG HER BIG BROTHER [/b] This bitch is outright creepy and fucked, i only played two volumes and i can already tell this person isn't 10 nor human, this is some alien wanting to infiltrate human society by seeing if a brother would actually bang his own 10 year old sister. Since Kashou has got real sex slaves under his complete sentimental and legal control then he might aswell go for it [b] ショコラ and FUCKING バニラ [/b] These are the two sprites that more people have masturbated to than they'd like to admit or everyone else would like to. The first of them is your generic anime character made for comedic relief and the second is a lesbian tsundere- yes you heard that right. LESBIAN TSUNDERE. Or bisexual, i don't even know already. They both love their master and want to embrace his D. [b] POLYGAMY [/b] This game embraces polygamy that's it. Okay, i'll be fair about this. Maybe i'm looking too superficially at Nekopara, i found something interesting about it, by paying attention to detail on all the details of it's worldbuilding. I'll start off by some keypoints:  [u] Genetical Engineering [/u] Okay, let's be honest, it doesn't make any sense realistically speaking but bare with me, i'm going to defend my thesis on how Nekopara portrays a dystopian Japan that hasn't evolved in the slightest in terms of gender equality. First of all, remember we're talking about the CAT part of CATGIRLS ; This means, all 'nekos' in this game aren't Hominids with some feline characteristics, it's Felines with humanoid characteristics, this mean genetical engineering has advanced a lot by the time of this games story. Which doesn't sound like a lot; These felines have developed a limited range of human emotions but they're not quite on the level of free thought ; in fact, with just treating them well they'll like to bang you as soon as they hit puberty, which is about 3 to 4 years in. (Chocola is legal in cat years!!! LMAO!!!) [u] Social critic on Sexism [/u] It is widely known that Japan is an incredibly patriarchal society where women traditionally refer to their husbands as their 'owners' , but Nekopara i think is trying to make a social critic, putting our main lead as just a nice dude but making the two main girls act like his slaves and at the same time entering a romantic relationship- You see where i'm getting here? The owners thought this up all along, it's a message to open our eyes and to stop sexism, and to strive for the complete freedom of all sentient life, something necessary in our galaxy- And this world! The engineering of catgirls is unethical, since catboys don't even exist, they're created in order to be slaves of the human, and every hominid who dares bang their catgirl is being a zoophiliac and just abusing their slaves and turning them into real dolls. Open your eyes people, [b]NEKOWORKS IS TRYING TO SEND AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE, AND ALL YOU DO IS UNZIP YOUR PANTS. THIS GAME IS WRONG. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS MORALLY WRONG. THE SOCIETY IN THIS GAME IS WRONG. therefore i recommend this game[/b]
hella nice
Im sorry mum
I got this game gifted to me, it's pretty good.
I love neko. i wish to be one.
La Soleil has great chocolate and vanilla cream pie. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I'm a disappointment to my family.
Actual best game
Seems like a pretty good game, i don't think i've played it enough to give it a fair rating yet though.
>Was supposed to play this game as a meme >Catgirls with bouncy boobies arrives in my field of vision >Presses "P" in game >Proceedes to feel even more lesbian >Now I'm addicted and I got all the volumes >I'm purring in japanese someone help >Vanilla must be protected >Mapel and Cinnamon best girls >Nudity is a way of life my sweet children >I play the nekopara soundtrack in my car openly for my parents >I'm a dissapointment to my family  10/10 would bang again
Having played and enjoyed Vol. 0 first, I was quite taken aback by how much I disliked NEKOPARA Vol. 1. This visual novel is a plodding, saccharine slice of life story that slowly degenerates into something far worse: A normalization of polyamory, incest, and bestiality so disgusting I could barely bring myself to jerk off to it.
Anime tittes and catgirls, well worth the 9,99€
11 hours better spent than csgo
Okay, so I bought this as a joke, so I didn't use the 18+ patch.  [u]Notable Features:[/u] [list] [*] Voice acting is good; subtitles available in English, Chinese, and Japanese. [*] Still-image slides are nicely done; some could easily be used as wall papers. [*] The story is alright. [/list]  If you want more "plot" than the censored version, there are plenty of guides on how to do it.
before you install make sure that you are familiar with words (waifu, pantsu, sempai) otherwise no chance \ (•◡•) /  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwyKSsOpjBE
Fuck 'Er Right In The Pussy.
The society within this game is based on genetic modification (of human, cats, and most likely other animals) and slavery. This game will make you question the morality of these problems we find in our own society. This games true message can only be grasped by those who are not true intellectuals. 10/10   Also, the 18+ 'PLOT' DLC really enhances the dilemmas posed by the previous issues.
Family friendly content....[spoiler]until that scene[/spoiler]  I fucking love cats
This novel isn't for perverts.  If you're thinking about getting this game because it's got catgirls dressed up as maids with boobs, and you think that's sexy, then you *may* buy this game, you may crank up the chest bounciness meter as high as it can go, but if you are capable of sentiment, even in the slightest, then you're better off not reading it all the way through, and just sticking to the first few screens of bouncy catgirl boobs. Why?  Because, if you go any further, you WILL become emotionally attached to this game and its characters, and you won't be able to get off to it anymore. You'd best be sticking to something like Sakura Spirit for that sort of thing.  This game...this novel...it's something else. I was gifted this game by a friend of mine. I honestly didn't expect much at first. I just thought he got it me as a joke, and it was going to end up like one of those other visual novels centred on sex or the like.  I was wrong. And I think it deserves a proper review.  First off, there's the story. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but it's very well presented. It never once felt sex orientated. For the most part, the narrative was well paced, and the content was powerfully emotional and heart wrenchingly touching at times. I mean POWERFUL. Trust me, there were a few times through the story where I nearly cried. The story doesn't just deal with the theme of love. It deals with other themes such as loyalty, determination, family, selflessness and self-sacrifice. It weaves all of these themes into a beautiful yarn that wraps hard around your heartstrings and doesn't let go. It did seem to sacrifice narrative for..."Liberties" at times, but it's only to be expected. Sometimes, that's what people come to see.  The story is also structured solidly by its attention to detail. They could've just left it at; "There are catgirls in this world, and that's that", but they don't. They provide not only a reason for the catgirls coming to be, but also detail on how politics deal with the issue of an overabundance of catgirls, information on their behaviour, as well as their place in society and how they are treated. They don't really go into detail about any "Catboys", though. What? They also give detail on the catgirls’ mating cycle and their inability to produce young with humans, but they don't mention how they have been able to reproduce. Anyway, that's just a small nitpick.  Next, the writing. The game has its own sense of humour that expresses itself constantly. Not too much, letting up at tender moments, bringing greater contrast to its sentimental narrative. It's witty, and has a varied palette of different kinds of humour, stemming from cute humour, to blunt humour...It even makes the occasional dirty joke. Again, even though there are quite a few deliberate innuendos scattered around the story, it doesn't ever feel like it focuses on sex for appeal or humour, only occasionally applying it for the effect the other audience desires. Notice I said; "Other audience".  I say this because I believe it was created for the purpose of appealing to a demographic that desired emotional relationships, not sexual ones. Sure, it hints at it here and there, but ultimately, it goes for the audience that feels, rather than the one that..."feels".  As for the graphics, it's spectacular. The cutscenes and backgrounds are well drawn and detailed, with bright inviting colours, but that's not the star attraction. What's important here is the animation. Yes, animation. In a visual novel. Oh come on, just how did you think the "chest bounciness" slider was going to be used if the characters didn't MOVE? And oh, do they. The art style may be reminiscent of visual novels of the past, but the characters are far from static. They move even when standing still. You can see every breath they take, every gesture they make, every single movement is smoothly animated and articulated, and...*sigh*, if you really care about that sort of thing, the boobs do move realistically as well, and respond well to the respective slider.  For its attention to detail, story, romance, sparkling wit and of course, the animation, I would recommend it to any catgirl fan who wants genuine romance, not just sex.  Overall - 8.5/10 A beautiful story that flows well, but the whole "cat" gimmick may be too cheesy for some. Be warned.
Very good game 18+ was worth it #neko
Why have dignity when you can have NEKOS! Just download the patch and have fun ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Best shooter game ever
Yeah it's alright i guess. Don't really like the plot though.
This game changed my life and made me question my sexuality.   10/10
For those who are into visual novels, don't hesitate with this series !  The story is really cute and each volume give more detail about each characters.  Neko-girls everywhere !
yes
ChocoVani
They're fine.
I bought this game and brought dishonor upon my family.    But I really don't care.
I can't do it. I won't leave a negative review as I haven't played all the way through (or past the first hour for that matter), but yea. That being said, if you know what this game holds and like the idea of it, grab the patch as I'm pretty sure Steam doesn't show the goods.
beautiful played it twice just like how the mc fucks them twice
Nekos are ok.
My grandfather was a heavy smoker. When I was 10 years old, my grandmother told him "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop smoking." Tears welled up in his eyes. From then on he quit and never went back. He died from lung cancer three years later. It was a sad time and it destroyed me. My mom said to me "Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through." I agreed. Now, at 16, I've never touched a cigarette and I must say, I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
Returning to the first one, I realize that this was the beginning of a mastapiece.
Good, but better when you got the R 18+ Patch which i have.    IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING  BOIIIS
i just nutted to this
Cute visual novel with cute catgirls, wholesome. Just buy it for that. If you just want the hentai scenes, just go look them up.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I can't look at cats the same way ever again
I just find myself happy with the simple things. Appreciating the blessings God gave me.
Nice Kitties.
I want 2 die

I play the game for the plot.
heat
Tiddies
Cats are cute. Girls are cute. Catgirls are cute. But this game is erotic.

10/10
A visual novel that will capture the hearts of all of those who play it.  10/10 buy it and enjoy.
I basically learned how to use ultra instinct. Whenever I hear someone's footsteps coming towards my room I instantly press Alt + Tab in a mere second.

It's got catgirls, what more do you want?
Came for catgirls but stayed for the heavy plot.
Only playable is the  18+ version. Had to pay another 9 Dollar. I FUCKING HATE STEEEEEEEEEMM    But the game is gud.

Pros -Cool story -High tech physics -Great Dialogue -CATS THERES A LOT OF EM'  Cons -You'll be disowned by your parents
I just wish my steam friend list didnt know I played this, also I'm starting a kickstarter to fund the research on catgirls. here is the link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

The game that I bought for my child, the final exam is good, reward him!
I really like how they added a physics engine, just so you can adjust tiddy bounciness ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
nice game =w=
Defintely worth it to buy and play. This game is beautiful and really deserves to call itself a visual novel. Gameplay is cute and really interesting. I was really enjoying this game.
This is where your life turns to the embodiment of cringe, try not to call any of these girls your waifus.
I played through the entire (game)? This game is mind-numbingly boring! I really cannot understand all these positive reviews.  What is the story here? This weird guy opens a bakery and cannot do anything without the help of his sister and her catgirls. Like what was your plan dude? You would have failed in a week without the help. The catgirls are straight up annoying. I guess this is for people who love anime and hentai. I tried to like it, but it was so damn annoying and boring. Never again!
Chapter 1-4: Ooo. i'm liking this story~! Chapter 5: oh...... oh..... ohhhhhhhhhhhh...... oohhh.. uhmm.... that's a different story. moving on. (best game 10/10 almost like dark souls)
you know exactly why you are buying this ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The game that started it all. If you's a man of culture, you'll buy it too.
Neko is Justice
At this point in time i have had this game for a single day and i can already tell the pain and suffering to my well being and others it has caused in only one day my friends and family have stopped talking to me saying "you have a problem" and trying to drag me away from my computer seat i of course the alpha male i am hiss and swat screeching "Coconut best girl" there is police surronding my room because they belive i am a danger to human society and the way it stands i belive this game has made me a god and noone can stop me from going through with my wishes of remaking this world for coconut and i to live in harmony the backlash is strong but i will succeded and noone can stop me from going through with my wish, i will be the savior of this world.
I mean...who doesn't like catgirls???
AMAZING Experience, 10/10. From the soundtrack to the ehem... assets it was CHOICE. For those curious yes you do get to do the things you want to do to them. Vanilla > Chocola, stay mad fags. Buy this game, buy this game for a friend, buy one for your mother. E-mail it to your math teacher. 10/10
.//see below for TLDR summary well, to be completely honest theres not much story progression in this story and it's almost purely fanservice. whatever you see from the preview will be literally what you get, there are no choices in the game and you can practically foresee what's going to happen just before buying this game anyways. but still nekogirls, who wouldn't want that right? if you're looking for a visual novel that is more indepth rather than a typical 'semi dating sim' which has a huge storyline then this novel isn't for you.  //TLDR Pros: Fanservice Interactive Music is decent Nekogirls w/ diff personalities Explores character development You get both the girls so why not Uses real facts about cats (like when they feel heated etc) More into eroge than hentai (altho available on their official page)  Cons: No multiple choices There's not much storyline Could get boring after awhile since the story is quite predictable It's quite a light read, so I wouldn't recommend people that are looking for heavy contents  Overall, I still think it's quite decent for the right type of people (like looking for fanservice), and new readers altho it's not really a novel that suits my taste.

How to make Chocola Fudge  INGREDIENTS 2 Cups white sugar 4 Tablespoon butter 1/2 Cup cocoa 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract 1 Cup milk   INSTRUCTIONS - Grease an 8x8 inch square baking pan. Set aside. - Combine sugar, cocoa and milk in a medium saucepan. Stir to blend, then bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer. Do not stir again.  - Place candy thermometer in pan and cook until temperature reaches 238 degrees F(114 degrees C). If you are not using a thermometer, then cook until a drop of this mixture in a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Feel the ball with your fingers to make sure it is the right consistency. It should flatten when pressed between your fingers.  - Remove from heat. Add butter or margarine and vanilla extract. Beat with a wooden spoon until the fudge loses its sheen. Do not under beat.  - Pour into prepared pan and let cool. Cut into about 60 squares.   Enjoy.
has nekos and lolis, whats not to like
Abolutely adore Vanilla, If you like visual novels, youll love the beautiful animaitons and CGs. Highly recommend u go online to look for the 18+ patches....... there is a great one on YT.
Playable at public places.  I mean place where weaboos live
I wish my girlfriend had a chest bounciness option.
An interesting game dealing with themes of race relations.
Can't disappoint my parents if I'm an orphan
It's so short and theres no choices. Pretty sure they fucked aswel so thats kinda awkward. I want my neko girls to be wholesome af. Thier boobs don't even wiggle when they're in their pajamas which is silly because boobs are the most bouncy in pajamas out of all of the clothes! 0/10 Realism  7/10 Good Looking  2/10 Short 0/10 No choices
bruh miss me with that gay sh1te 10/10
good shit 10/10
A great game for those who are willing to pay $10 for a visual representation of the Soviets taking over Berlin in the 2nd of May, 1945.
If you see in any of my other reviews, they most likely are going to be positive due to it not really being a game. Its a matter of choices and the visual content (candy eye *cough*).  Visual Novels are what you call hentai games. Yes that may be true but who are we to judge for not having at least some curiousity in reading the contexts of pleasure in these games. Not all visual novels even have suggestive themes well besides the one im about to review.   M E M E  R E V I E W   Nekopara is cute and thats all there is to say about it. If you like cute anime girls, what are you waiting for? Just buy the damn thing. Usually I'd say watch someone else play it but why should you? Read it yourself and make yourself a character in the game. Involve youself. Sure its weird (okay its beyond weird, you'd just be considered insane *garugama*).   Just check the game out for yourself to see whether you like it or not. Search what visual novels (or hentai games) are and see if you're willing to try them.  Its not that bad, some are actually really sweet and romantic. One I would recommend to those who have a bit of interest is Katawa shoujo its free to download online. Its on steam. Thanks for reading
the game is good and all but i thoguht it was an eroge and was very mislead by it and apparently you can only play the real eroge shit if its baught non-steam cause fuck steam...so fuck steam for misleading this shit so hard with the tags and shit
If you own any of the Nekopara games on Steam then odds are someone bought it for you as a joke. If you DO decide to play them, be aware of two things, the first being that it's as standard of a visual novel as you'll ever get. It looks standard, feels standard, the story is standard, everything is standard. Second, there is no H stuff unless you specifically purchase the additional patches. And even then the H stuff is standard too. Feel free to ask me how I know, but it's not worth the time.     That said, I recommend it solely on the basis that people who enjoy visual novels won't have a bad time with this. But if you don't, don't waste your (or your friend's) money.   As for me though, I thought it was a decent romp. The mood is cheery and if nothing else, the game will make you laugh. You can probably guess the plot just by looking at it and you'll have a hearty guffaw when you realize you were correct.    All in all, it's an erotic VN / 10. You know what to expect.
WOW 10/10 NEKO CHAN PLEASE I can't believe it this game is so amazing I spent sleepless nights playing it and I'm not even into visual novels! If you want to ruin your life even more you can buy the R-18 DLC from the Denpasoft page, same publisher under a different name, 100% recommended. You won't see cats the same way EVER again. The only part I didn't like was that one of the characters is not a neko girl wtf! [spoiler]In the end, Shigure the little sister wears cat ears so I guess it's alright.[/spoiler] BUT IT NOW
I don't want to play this
Praise Chocola
I got this Visual Novel for the NOVEL part, not the VISUAL part.  I got this game thinking that, because it is on steam, that the all nude parts would be filtered/removed (It seemed, according to other reviews, that a 'patch' is the only way to put them back.)   I was wrong (there is only one nude bath scene and two COVERED clothesless scenes).   Luckily, there is the 'skip' feature in this visual novel.  I personally think that all nudity is ugly (and I therefore actively avoid it), which is why I got this product on steam. I should have trusted the popular, user-defined tags.  Otherwise, this is a decent fantasy romance visual novel, involving catgirls that are discriminated against, and some typically societally unacceptable romantic activities.  I like the story.
this game saved my life, honestly like i was seriously down in the dumps. I even thought about sewercide. A BUTT. Anime titties have helped me see the light! Thank you for the cute animal girls. I now have spent $900 on animal girl body pillows to create my very own animal girl paradise in my room. This sanctuary of anime titties has allowed me to evolve into a higher form. One that knows true purpose.       Anime Titties saved my life -Honey wit da money
Its an amazing VN,but it is censored so a wider age range can play/read it. You will either have to buy the adult version from the offical webpage or do weird file transfer stuff to get more ummmmmm...research thingies.
Nice Story Cute catgirls What else to say? 10/10 best game I played this year [spoiler] Coconut best girl [/spoiler]
perfect
Heaven.
Im into some weird stuff but this is too much.

Hehehe, love this visual novel series so much! <3
Kashou (the main character) left his home to open a cake shop. One day he receives two cardboard boxes in the mail, shipped to him by his younger sister Shigure. The boxes contain two of his adopted catgirls he left at home, Chocola and Vanilla. Kashou wants to send the cat-girls back, but they show that they can be useful as maids in his shop, so he decides to let them stay. The animations are great, the soundtrack as well as the  colourful artwork radiates happiness and the voice acting is pleasant. The story is average and pretty predictable since it's a hentai game. Be careful and play this alone, this game doesn't only have hentai scenes, but it can be cringe sometimes. If you want to be called a weeb by your friends and a failure by your family, play it where everyone can see it. Buying this game on steam will give you a censored version. If you want the hentai scenes you should either install a mod for them or buy the game from their [url=https://nekoworks.booth.pm/items/65412]japanese website.[/url]  [table]     [tr]         [th]Pros[/th]         [th]Cons[/th]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Great aesthetics[/td]         [td]Not family friendly[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]Hentai scenes[/td]         [td]Average story[/td]     [/tr]     [tr]         [td]You can save your story everywhere! Right! everything is a checkpoint [/td]         [td]You need to mess with files to get the hentai patch[/td]     [/tr] [/table]  Conclusion: I recommend this game if you stay online at night or if you don't have many people around you. I don't really care about the story, so I turned a blind eye to the average story. I'm in love with the game's aesthetics, so I'm unable not to recommend this game. I would recommend buying it while it's on sale though.
This VN(Visual Novel) is really good, in all honest at first i was expecting it to be a terrible game, but i was glad i got it. i love the scene detail, the story and most of all i love the characters, they are great, i was laughing at some of the  comments and silly things the characters did. i was not expecting the story to be this good, but im hooked, played it throught to completion in one sitting then when throught and got the achievements i missed. i recommended trying the game, you wont regret it.
cute!
A wonderful game with wonderful characters.  The characters and CGs are really nice and set that peaceful mood, the soundtrack is beautiful and really helps you relax or get tense in the right moments and the story is very heartwarming and makes you want to keep going. There's also a +18 patch that you should tottaly buy, or you will lose a lot of the game.  10/10 would fuck my catgirls in heat again.  P.S.: Press p when the catgirls are on screen.
This is NOT A CHRISTIAN GAME! REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A CHRISTIAN GAME! DO NOT BUY!
This game will give you hope haha
high quality product
This is great. I don't know why I originally bought it, but I'm glad I did.
I'll mention something other reviews might not have mentioned...  The animation is pretty amusing and funny sometimes. It's visual humor... One example, I just find it funny when a character gets wide-eyed and closes WAY INTO THE CAMERA.  Try not to play this game when your wife or gf is around, obviously
I like catgirls :)
i wasnt loved as a child so here i am
Disappoint your parents the visual novel!
It's ok
Don't let Steam know but the actual developers of this game release a "patch". Wink.
This is the the first part of the nekopara visual novels and I have to say its quite good. It has beautiful artwork, the music is not that great but its not annoying either and the characters are quite likeable. The Story itself is quite decent giving you fun and enjoyable moments as some sad and hearthwarming moments as well. The writting was to my liking and not tiresome at all, I didn't notice when a full hour passed just from playing.  The game is not full since the adult scenes are censored and cut off from the game (but you can still find a patch online if thats what you are looking for) and doesn't have a major impact on the story development. Based on that I recommend you to buy the game during sale like I did.  PS: if you want the uncensor patch you'll have to look deep into gogle to find it, not that I've looked for it or smt.
this game reminds me of the vietnam war always it never stops THE BOMBS MY FRIENDS WHOM i once loved their lifeless bodies laying there while i am there i can see my legs three feet away and everyone unning until a catgirl saved me and ate my legs OH GOD IT IS COMING BACK don't make me go back man i cant do that again please don't make me go back AOH GOD THE BOMBS ARE DROPPING ONCE MORE THEY ARE ALL DYING AROUND ME PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE Me FROM THIS NIGHTMARE. certainly would reccomend because of the sweet memories and fun times and this is such a good game i got this game becasue i thought i have nothing else to do so why the fuccc not. the BOMBS THEY'RE BACK.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=897e_3srmbs  Accurate repsresentation whenever someone sees you playing this game
It may appear I have a low amount of time on this game, but that is actually because I play it in public with zero internet connection, with the volume high as I read out the dialogue, this is the perfect Thot Repellent and nothing can stop me now with my newfound transcending powers as I go beyond the average mortal and insert my hyper death omega pnoid into my laptop's tight usb port within the local realm of the lands of McDonalds.

how do u remove games from your library
Catgirl frickin' simulator Vol. 1
It was a visual light novel with no choices, no interesting story-line, and very cute catgirls. It is purely fan-service, which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but mostly it was a waste of my time.
You only play this game if you are a fucking furry weeabo who wants to fuck cat ladies I can't last achievement for some gay reason so the achievments are broken do not play this game 0/10
I don't get the appeal of catgirls. Couldn't play for more than an hour because they were annoying as fuck.
I used to be a bright child, enjoying my time with friends, going out, and generally enjoying life. Then I discovered anime which eventually led me to this. Now, I stay at home watching anime cat girls and hoping they'd become a reality. I've lost most of my friends and become socially inept. But let's be real here. Who needs friends when you have cat girls with tiddies
Everything I ever wanted in a Cat Girl.
The best game i've ever played!
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a masterpiece in this sad time of shit games. It pushes technological standards past anything one would have even hoped for in the next 10 years. Truly, not just a Game of the Year, but a Game of the Decade, and for centuries to come. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 will go down in history, so that even if you actually manage to keep your family bloodline going, your great-great grandchildren will be able to experience this truly awe-inspiring work of art.
It was one of my favourite games and I really loved the story
Now this why I bought a GTX 1070 TI.
Being a human waste was never so enjoyable
Nice visual novel (y)
Naked Cat girls what more could you possibly want? 10/10 would fap again
This game helped me satisfy my thirst for catgirls 11/10
I kind of feel bad for my tissue box..
[h1] review: [/h1] [list] [*]kawaii neko girls [*]nice music [*]great voice acting  [b] 10/10 [/b] best game ever made
[h1]Keep in mind that Steam doesn't allow porn, so it's censored and you'll need to find a patch online to get the adult content[/h1]  It's an ecchi visual novel with catgirls. Period.  That being said, the animation quality is fantastic for this type of genre. It uses a new engine which gives new life to this kind of thing. It's also entirely and professionally japanese dubbed.  I actually got quite involved with the story.  Chocola and Vanila volume.
let's be honest, y'all already know what to expect from it, else you wouldn't be here
where the fuck is all the hentai
I can feel a small part of my soul deteriorating everytime I hear a voice line.
Porn for steam v1
Many of you looking at the other reviews will tell you that Cinnamon is best girl. Do not believe these non-believers, for they  worship false gods. Coconut is the only Goddess. Chocola is second. but know where your loyalties lie first.  Seriously thou after completing my first playthrough with the uncensored patch I can safely say this. Buy it.  For a VN its voice acted very well and I hope most other VN's follow suite. There are 3 sex scenes and one bath scene. This Vol 1. focuses only on Chocola and Vanilla so I wouldn't be seeing my Bae until Vol. 2 which I will be starting now. Happy fapping!
I have found my new religion.
Animated H-Scenes!
it a good game the only thing i didnt like was it being censored alot but other than that it a good game but i would recomend the uncensord verson
good.
[i]Ooh... the heresy, he's doing an[/i] actual [i]review for Nekopara![/i] Nekopara is not really a game; it's a visual novel, more specifically, a kinetic visual novel. Think of it as a little story, since all the interactivity you'll have with this will be limited to advancing the story forward and [i]occasionally[/i] pressing 'P' to make all dem sweet catgirls jump (after of course setting the chest bounciness to whatever you want). Nekopara is essentially set in a near-future (or alternative) Japan where genetically engineered catgirls have been normalised. Catgirls are second-class citizens who must prove that they are able the act independently before being allowed to. However, this background tells you squat about what it's actually like, as this story focuses on Kashou Minadzuki (his name is usually romanised as Minaduki) as he founds a new patisserie with two catgirls who mailed themselves to the newly-founded patisserie, Chocola and Vanilla. Initially, Kashou resists their pleas to work with him, but as time goes on, his affection for the two catgirls grows until they become his 'catpanions'. Just to warn you, though, this visual novel does admit that any romantic relationship does turn sexual in the end. Because Steam is a company based in the West, they apparently ban all explictly sexual scenes from all their games (while allowing some positively gruesome violence; what the hell is going on!?) even though there exist methods to bar the little kids from experiencing them. So the Steam version has been censored from the original 18+ version, which, funnily enough, can be re-integrated with the Steam version. And, from what I've heard, it's pretty intense. Nekopara is essentially a feel-good story. Whether that feel-good comes from the heartwarming love story that unfolds through ups and downs, or from having a good ol' jerk off is up to you. A visual novel like this, though, is more than just a 'picture book for adults', since you've got music, voice acting, and beatiful animation which is probably the best you can get without using 3D animation. If you're a cultural elitist who dictates that 'all good media is deep and meaningful, and that which is not is utter trash' then boy are you gonna hate this. But if you've grown sick of how Western media has gotten so 'gritty' and 'dramatic' then this is a welcome breath of fresh air. I say I recommend this visual novel, but I only recommend it for fellow otakus. Not for normies, people who can't adequately separate reality and fantasy enough to realise that what happens here should not be concerning, right-wing Christian fundamentalists, fourth-wave feminists (just thought I'd mention the artist is female) and [i]definitely[/i] none of the 'anti-weebs'. [b]Have a fun time with your six catgirls![/b]
I played this game only for the spring cleaning badge. Please help me god...
it's ok, but, it was a gift i swear~
quick nut
An educational game about World War II and sex deprivation.
As the Founding Fathers once said: "Give me itty bitty kitty titties or give me death"
Came for the hentai Stayed for the Kawaii neko girls
-bad writing -Stupid plot -bad music +chinese anime
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
bestiality is bad. anime is bad. this game? very bad.
What A Wondeful World I lIve In! We Have Games Where You Are The Owner Of ''CatGirls.'' Who Can Ask For Anything Better! ([Here Is For The Review Of The Game WIth The Hentai Scenes-  Idk If It Makes It Better Or Worst.... But Hey!- I didn't Pay For The Extra Scenes I Just ******* It!])
Fvck steam for trying to censor anime, FVCK YOU!!!
What has been seen, can't be unseen...  (1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1)x1000000/100
Catgirls. Need I say more?
Save the cats
tfw you won't be there when genetically engineered catgirls becomes real
My friend gifted me all of the games so I can play. First I started playing it as a funny joke, but now I am officially hooked to the game. PRECIOUS NEKO GIRLS
DOPE!
meh it wasn't for me.
a good horror game implented to make you hide from your family, friends and setting your status to "offline"
When I started Nekopara I was hopeful, I hard heard how great it was (and that it had Catgirls)    but when I got to the first H-scene I was immediately dissapointed by how mediocre it was, the next one is the same except the position of the Catgirls are reversed, and the rest of the H-scenes are about the same level of quality, not great but not that bad either.  The story goes from bad to non-existent, to get the unrated patch it costs 10$ and without the unrated patch this "game isn't even worth my sock, and this isn't really a game there is no gameplay it's just a kinetic novel which are visual novels without choices.  Overrall this "game" fails where it matters (H-scenes).
Catgirls are more than a game, they're a lifestyle
Nekopara will fill your lonely weeb heart that cannot find love in life. Endulge yourself on catgrils and more catgrils and more catgrils until you're satisfied.   The things that the Nekopara Visual Novel series gave me: - A thing for catgrils. - Cat ears make everything better. - Catgrils are the best in terms of furries *COUGH* - Loving catgrils wont make you a furry lover *thinking* - Diabetes because of the sweet catgril smiles - Eye-gasm because it was a very good Visual novel and great content as well - A lot of friends to talk about the series
Sorry but I prefer Coconut ...  Vanilla is very cute and smug though :)
Hm? I see Cat Girls in a maid uniform. OwO what's this. We get all these cute catgirls without even triggering unusual flags and no bad ends. Worth the money I have been saving for life insurances. 11/10 would whack my joystick again and again
Pretty good though my version is for all ages, you can download the [spoiler]18X patch[/spoiler] in other way :) (Pure) But I don't know how to unlock the personal achievement"Try it in Japanese".In fact ,such mess made me mad :-(
Heartwarmingly Uncomfortable ⚈ ̫ ⚈
Got this 50% off during a sale. A bundle containing: Cute Nekos A goodstory line, And becoming a disapointment to your whole family! Al at the fair price of 5 euro's!
Why does my cat keep hissing at me
This is a game for tough guys only, otherwise how could you deal with the overwhelming cuteness?  Any suggestions? just take off your pants, grab your weapon, and you know what to do.
I'm loving this game it is so good
Good Game
I'm sorry mom I just disappointed you again.  10/10 would clean my room again
*looks at tags* Educational huh? Well it sure can be sometimes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
9/10 should add r-18 patch on the workshop
nekopara is a visual novel game, its funny that the dlc for the game is not available here, its really the only reason why I bought the game, but anyways this visual novel is really cool because the characters seems alive, they use this really cool new animation technology that move diferent layers of image in real time, probably not prerendered like expected from 2d animations, for what I know its called live 2d, cool stuff, this should be default for visual novels in the future, good game if you are playing the full version.  +great soundtrack +amazing graphics -gameplay only available in the paid dlc  10/10
why dose it say sexwal content when there isnt eny
This game ravished me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) .
The pressure was too much. I'd sunk down to their level.  It wasn't worth it. Nothing was.
My life has never felt so fulfilled and empty at the same time.  11/10  (Also I recommend geting the r18 version for extra juicy content)
Proof that God exists. Make sure you patch it.
[h1] [[Note: This review is written from using the uncensored version of the game.]] [/h1]  This review is for the visual novel of Nekopara Vol. 1.  This isnt really a game, but an experience better then most books can offer. Without spoiling any plot, I suggest anyone picking up this story gets the uncensored orginal patch to play the game.  I feel with the story's tone and mood playing the censored verison of the game is a great dishonner to the artists and story writer. If you like japan, if you like cat girls, then just get this one.  Trust me, this is a high quality visual novel thats worthy of anyone's time. It has good humor, art, music, and a decent storyline. It also tries to explain how cat like people live, react, and the laws that effetc them.  Just get the game, and use the uncensored patch to add back in the orginal content.   You wont regret it.
get that r-18 patch down and we boolin  its a game all about catgirls bruh i aint complaining
10/10 game. i think i skipped a important scene though
catgirls 10000000000/10
Very good yes yes
A wholesome story with lots of family values. It teaches you on what it's like being an adult I recommend purchasing this great title if you want a good real life simulation
Sexy catgirls 1000000000/5
Cinnamon is the best catgirl.
What a nice game
At first I tried to deny this game because of all the reviews, but I love anime style games and VNs.  But if you want a non laughable review of this game I will give it to you.  Nekopara is a unique experince to say the least I even tried to stop playing it and I couldn't because of the amazing artwork and animations as well as dialouge, originally this game is 18+ game which is obvious as you read the dialouge but for this version a lot is censored for a more open audience, I've viewed parts of the original scenes and it is what it is, I support sexual content I think it should be open in most games as opposed to violence, but overall the story is cute and laughable at times and not taken seriously, the characters are very enjoyable too, If you also want to know how I feel about this VN, I asked for a refund and then rebought the complete edition because I regreted my decision of letting it go and I decided really wanted to read the whole VN.  There isn't much to say about the story as it is very simple, because it involves a baker and his catgirls which also involves other "actions" he does to the catgirls but just know you will be sucked in when you start this VN.
it killed my stream dude
My GOD what a MASTERPIECE.  For anyone making a light novel game make something like this and boom, you get money and ladies. now the cover for the game shows two girls and this being a visual novel make oh i have to choose one but sike you get both. This ain't some pussy shit either its not just a kiss nah bro its straight up magical what you do in this instant classic. Buy this perfect game right now
The whole review in three sentences: BUY IT NOW!!! IMMEDIATELY!!! ALL OF 'EM!!!  OK, here it goes. Usuallt in my reviews I try to point out pros and cons of the reviewed game but this is not the case here. The game is simply flawless. Seriously,  The plot is as simple as it can possibly be, but the reason everyone (or at least 99% of people) is not the plot. It the ambience of the game. You look at the catgirls, you listen to the music, you read the dialogues and after 3 or 4 hours you ask yourself: "Why I cannot get enough of this? Why do I want to play more?".  Everything here is adorable. Every character is drawn perfectly, the music is as suitable as it gets and the dialogues are stupid. Yes, the most stupid dialogues in the history of VNs, but it makes the game itself. If not for them "Nekopara" games wouldn't have even the half of its charm and I mean it. Anime cliches are here and there but still I cannot imagine where they would suit more than here.  Characters + dialogues = 90% of "Nekopara". It is well known that if you don't have good characters in an anime-game it is trash. Well, the cutest catgirls you can find are here. In addition to cuteness they pretty charismatic so you will love them after first couple of minutes that you've seen them.  Lots of details like a cat on the tie that Azuki wears and straight pupils of the catgirls are the rest 10% percent of "Nekopara"'s secret. One can find a lot if interesting stuff if he just stops the game and look around.  All in all the is awesome, and it hits the highest possible mark, I would strongly recommend to play it to everyone who read it.

i love this game, can't wait to cosplay vanilla soon <3  they are angels~
Today, as of this edit, it's my birthday and I decided to spend my time with Chocola and Vanilla, and I did so from beginning to end in one sitting (That's 5 hours straight). What can surpass the feeling of being surrounded by these kawaii neko ladies?    On that note, i'm being serious, today is actually my birthday.  What am I doing with my life, smh...   11/10
loli catgirls, what else do you want?   lew/10
LOVE this series can't tell you much with out spoilers but I loved this story.
I felt discontent with the game so I bought the patch.  10/10
I like cats, that's why I got it.
He introduced me to his religion and I gladly accepted.  What a great time to be alive...
Le ebic catgirls
I have been enlighten by this visual novel. Catgirls in maid outfits is pure genius.  - Cuteness guarenteed - Lewdness guarenteed - Catgirls in maid outfits guarenteed - Plot involved - It's a one-hand visual novel so you can use your left hand for something else   My name is WizeDog and I approve this Visual Novel
Oh boy, it's that time again for me.  This game is...um...interesting, to say the least.   Welp, this is a fun take on the visual novel genre. You got some catgirls. You got some bakery. You got some little sister (NO INCEST, DON'T WORRY). This can make for a unique twist on things.  However, I'm warning you now, this is the censored version. If you do decide to purchase this [b]all-ages hentai[/b] and then decide to get the uncensored version, it's out there. For about $10 per volume, so $30 total.   All I can say is, I recommend it. One word as to why: [b] c a t g i r l.[/b]
Trash
I didn't knew where to hide from my parents. Now I don't know where tf I am lol.  Update: I was  in the Amazonian jungle and my mom caught me when she was cleaning the corner :(
What can a man not want more than a harem of barely legal cat girls.
Catgirls are the epiphany of genetic engineering
They Jebaited me. T_T
If the opening hours of Persona 5 are like starting a massive novel, then the closing hours are like finishing one, complete with the bittersweet finality of turning the last page. But it also carries an immense sense of satisfaction. After 100 hours of playing, all of my big questions were answered. I understood the characters, I knew my way around the world, and I had fun almost every step of the journey. You become a resident of Persona 5 the more you play it, and it has the rare ability to transport in a way few games can.
BEST GAME EVER! You build ur harem of 6 cat girls from busty to flat-chested. What more could you possibly want. Although the game is slightly NSFW material.
Ok. This game is really good. Like, my top 5 games. The other 2 are also in the top 5. I can't describe  how good it is. I hate anime, but this game is good. Probably because the characters aren't two dimensional, except in the literal sense. They actually have traits and flaws unique to them. Just buy this game. Grahpics are really good.  The E-mote engine allows 3-d models that looks 2-d or something like that, since they can turn around and all that. The story is also pretty good. It is a VN, so there won't be any actual choices, but it's good nonetheless. There is technically no gameplay, but thats fine by me. I'm not a fan of VNs (or, I wasn't) or anything anime related, but buy this game. It's worth full price, but buy it on a sale if you don't want to spend $10.
10/10
This Game brought my will to live back
the xxx version of the game costs money.  10/10 would lose $100 again

I have no friend.  But i have these neko girls.
GOOD SHIT
I actually masturbated to this no joke (I'm autistic)
this game has boob jiggling physics and [spoiler]you can also have sex with cat girls[/spoiler]  10/10
I have so much stealth playing this that I literally used my mums credit card to buy this and she still hasn't discovered it.
WUBALUBADUBDUB!
CAT GIRLS!!!!
Go offline so your friends won't judge you.

This game is a bit different than you know games. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful story and the characters, as well as the setting is beautifully drawn. To which the voices are also very pleasant.
greatest game i ever played     HIGHLY RECOMENDED
How do I hide this from people on my friends list?
This is how you make your friends and family disown you.  But in all honesty, it pretty fun to play in your spare time (if ya know what i mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )  Honest Review, 3/5 - Good
God left me unfinished. This game finished his work.  10/10 best First person shooter of all time.
Remember that for every dollar spent on wars, is a dollar not spent on genetically engineered Catgirls for domestic ownership
Well..... my second visual novel and I am still adjusting to not being able to kill things constantly although this game had a pretty good story for what it is.   Yes, I bought it for the cat girls and I think it was worth the money that I got it on sale for.  7/10 - Not enough water.
This game 10/10 IGN  -MC very soft guy  -Nice Game For Nice Ejaculating
Age is just a number. Jail is just a room.
Just no. No, no. No. Ignore the hours I've put in to this, I've kept leaving it on and playing other games and then flicking a few scenes and then playing another game. Then it hit a very... odd part of the story and I gave up. Now I've hidden it amongst my games in hopes I never see it again.
This game gave me carpal tunnel syndrome.
The best volume Vanilla best neko  I would love it more if they made the steam version have h-scene ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Well to be honest, I just skip through the stories so that I can enjoy the "art".
I bought this when I could've watched pornography.
I'm sorry, I love VNs, but this is just so fucking boring...
Nekopara is a story about a guy who just wants to open up a damn pastry shop but is hounded by the Japanese Anime Protagonist 1st world problem of having incredibly cute or sexy girls be in love with you.  Your dream is to just open up the shop and be a respectable pastry seller, but naturally, you are thwarted by lewd suggestions, jiggle physics, suggestive situations and well...  They're adorable and sexy cat girls. 2 of them.  You're fighting a losing battle, but considering this isn't a depressing or horror game, you'll probably still open up your pastry shop anyways.   [spoiler] After possibly breeding 2 cat girls.[/spoiler]
Great V.N.  I love the voice acting and the character animations, with Vol 0, 2 and 3 out It's a one heck of a ride! But in my opinion, it's a little short compared to other VNs I played, otherwise, AMAZING.  If my parents ever found out I play these VNs, I'd get disowned haha.
Manko
10/10 Neko's on point.
I liked the story, not once did I feel it was dragging and the animations were amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who loves VNs
I have to say Aaron nice job on your achivements I already asked a freond request check your friends list  41 Ringos Does good Grameplay!
8 out of 10 Cats Does a Countdown
The occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War (1939–1945) began with the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, and it was formally concluded with the defeat of Germany by the Allies in May 1945. Throughout the entire course of the foreign occupation, the territory of Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR) with the intention of eradicating Polish culture and subjugating its people by occupying German and Soviet powers.[1] In summer-autumn of 1941 the lands annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Germany in the course of the initially successful German attack on the USSR. After a few years of fighting, the Red Army drove the German forces out of the USSR and across Poland from the rest of Central and Eastern Europe.
My friends and family have completely given up on me...  [b]10/10[/b]
This game is beautiful.
I thought I was ready. I was not ready.  I feel like I need a baptism.
It's not fanservice, it's...moeeee!
Catgirls are best girls 10/10
Boobs
Good graphic design, heartwarming story and a lot of adorable nekomimi. What more do you need?
I wish I had a catgril
I like this game a lot but was initially going to leave a review explaining why I wouldn't recommend it. In the midst of writing it though I came to the conclusion that doing so wouldn't be very fair and decided to talk about the two elephant girls in the room instead.  Firstly, it has absolutely no gameplay whatsoever. You can literally load it up, press autoplay, sit back and let the entire game play out before you without having to interact with it again. I'm no connoisseur of visual novels but I've played a few of them and this was a first for me. I went into it expecting to make the usual choices (which cat girl to be with, currying favour, dates etc.) and want potential buyers to aware that no such interactivity exists.  Secondly, the game is heavily censored on Steam, a platform that allows you to experience the likes of Hatred in their purest form. Patches can be acquired to remove said censorship but I was unable to get any of them to work with the Steam version no matter what methods I followed. Initially I was begrudgingly okay playing the censored version but a few points in the game made me feel like I was missing out on a lot of content - and I was. After a trip to the high seas, I realized that the hentai elements make up a sizeable chunk of the game. This became a double edged sword for me as I ended up feeling like the primary h-scene was extremely excessive and out of place with the tone and theme the game was setting. Your mileage is naturally going to vary here.  On sale, with the above in mind, if you know this is the type of thing you're into you will have a fun time.
Well used money, i have no regrets.  Cute game.
I had sex with a cat  EDIT:Now I had sex with TWO cats
A few tips for those of you new to japanese visual novels:  -Headphones  -Privacy  -Tissues
It's too cute! It's killing me!

Catgirls ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
You know exactly whether or not you want this why are you even looking at the reviews.
Don't let the categorizations and other reviews fool you. This game is, at heart, a horror game. When you look at all the underlying moral and ethical issues surrounding this universe, your soul will die a little. Or a lot. 10/10 would again drive people to drink by streaming this. (Note: Twitch allows the Steam version but not the uncensored version. For obvious reasons.)  Quick edit: Better yet, the main character will at times gain some understanding that this universe is screwed up and note it--the game itself mocks the players/readers for enjoying it! Glorious. And its defenders are diehard and get all butthurt when you point this stuff out, which is also really entertaining, which helps my soul after playing/reading it.
What started out as a R-rated game has turned into the sweetest thing since Diabetics blood.   It's a visual novel about catgirl slaves that love their owner, with as much cuteness as the cakes they sell in their cafe "La Soleil".  It's playful and has an 18+ patch if you are into that sort of thing.  Apparently a lot of people are [or they just love these catgirls] , as the game got 2 sequels, volume 2 and 3, a prequel, volume 0 and a 60 minute OVA broken up into 3 episodes, with further volumes and projects tied to the franchise on the way soon, according to the developers.  All are on steam.  tl;dr its the reason Appear Offline exists.

It's okay
I love this Volume HAHAHA ecchi scenes
Time to bust out the headphones
11/10 but I wish you wouldnt uncensored it :(
Weaboo fake anime sex trash. Nothing redeemable about this product. Actually that's not quite true, you can make some coin off the cards. Otherwise worthless.
We have transcended into superior beings
i bear this burden so my friends do not have to one of us had to become the man of experience and so i sacrificed my sanity, in exchange for a new world; a world of kawaii neko girls  mortals beware, for i have transcended
Good graphich and character, story is so so... Better to get the patch after complete it :D 7.5/10

A happy adult VN that is about a nut who owns a bakery geting a harem of catgirls from his thirsty sister.
Well I buy this just not to get guilty for playing the cracked version  (which includes the H-scence that the Steam version had left out). 10/10
It's ok
Genetically Engineered Catgirls. Thats all you need.
[i]The year is 2018. Random guy on the internet SILVER FOX creates a strawpoll to decide which visual novel to play next, and because his friends hate him, they all vote for the masterpiece that is NEKOPARA.[/i]  For years I have wondered if this series is actually any good and after playing it, I gotta say, not really a huge fan. I'll start off with the things I like about it because it wasn't all awful - the presentation overall is pretty nice, all of the characters have animations and I think a lot of effort went into it. They even have mouth movement! The CGs looks good too and I thought the music was pretty catchy.  The story is about a guy named Kashou moving out of his house to start up a bakery/sweets shop/whatever so he can start a new life without telling his family. However, 2 boxes arrive and contain 2 catgirls - Chocola and Vanilla. Shenanigans happen. I found the best parts of this game are when they do cat-like things like getting drunk from catnip.  Outside of that there isn't much to say. The story was predictable, the game is clearly an eroge that has been censored since they show you what happens before and after the sex scenes instead of writing them out and as a comedy it isn't really that funny. At least in my opinion. If you're interested in this game then you've probably played it already, and if you liked it then that's fine, but I don't really get it. If the sequels are the same as this, which I heard they are, then I don't think i'll be playing them.
I played this game...what more do I need to say? Yes, the character models move; and yes, there is a boobs bounciness slider...what the **** is this game even?!  Overall Score: 10/10
Fun game!

Everyday we stray further from god.     So im glad im not religious

Apparently Chocola and Vanilla are 9 months old.  We will do it anyway, right guys?  [i]What's that sound?[/i]

Here is my review of Nekopara Vol. 1  I really liked the game. The game tells the beginning of the story. From little nekos to big nekos. The music is also top again. 😄  A long story with lots of text and lots of animations. You can set the jiggle physics again. For the anime tiddies. 😅 You can unlock several achievements. 😉  Well, the humor speaks for itself and the atmosphere is nice too. I'm happy with the game. 😁  Feeling and Characters:  Protagonists: Kashou Minaduki, Chocola, Vanilla, Maple, Shigure Minaduki, Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon and Coconuts. Antagonist: None Surroundings/ Feeling: Maid Café, City, Neko Paradise. 🐱   Here is my final/ end video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa1dFefaDyc  Thanks to Steam, NEKO WORKs and Sekai Project. 👍
This game is my absolutely my favorite anime type of game that I like!!!!
I heard you like nekos. This game is great for you if you like nekos and/or just need to relax. (i recieved this as a gift and then proceeded to buy the other 3)
(DON'T BUY THIS GAME) i did a little reserch and found out this is a cut version of this game (there's a lot of missing scenes) your going to have to figure out how to install a patch to fix this which in my opinion is not worth it at all if i have to risk getting a virus to fix this game its not worth it at all. i mean steam won't even fix it let me try some resemblance. this game is like playing call of duty without the gun sound effects. all of them are like this
Pretty good game here, it really did wonders for my  World War II  PTSD
Oh lord..
I regret nothing.
Status: Finished Loved the first volume! Can't wait till i get the other ones in the bundle!
horny pastry puffer.
No comment, just great game.
Rating: 6/10 ("Decent")  Recommended for: People who enjoy VNs, people who like slice of life, people who like cute things. I would not recommend this to a first time VN reader.  Nekopara Volume 1 (presumably) serves as an introduction to the series Nekopara, an episodic visual novel that centres around the main character, Kashou, and his bakery. He is helped by his multitude of catgirls, basically girls with cat ears, tails, and cat-tendencies. In-universe, they're generally treated as sub-human and as pets. They appear to have regular cat lifespans in (mostly) human bodies.  The premise is very obviously an excuse for a relaxing slice of life VN, and that is what Nekopara is. There are no choices to make and no branching paths to follow; it is all very linear. All you need to enjoy it is to click through it. It took me just under 5 hours to read the whole visual novel, which is decent, but a little short for its cost in my opinion. Of course, I read volume 1 without the H scenes, so perhaps those add a sizable chunk to reading time.   Nekopara boasts impressive production values; the character sprites are extremely detailed, and are also animated to go along with character movements and speech. Clothing is beautiful and full of different nuances. Backgrounds are very good and match the quality of the character sprites. The best thing about the game, however, is its CGs: they are colourful, vibrant, and exceptional. Without a doubt, most of Nekopara's value is in its artwork and the cuteness of the characters.  Speaking of the characters, the VN introduces Kashou, Shigure (his sister), and the many catgirls: Vanilla, Chocola, Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon, and Coconuts. This volume mainly focuses on Kashou's relationship with Vanilla and Chocola. Judging by the descriptions of the rest of the volumes, they will likely cycle to focus on the catgirls that did not receive as much attention during volume 1. That being said, all the characters are quite distinguishable, and all have different personalities.  The soundtrack was not particularly memorable, but it served its purpose.  In general, Nekopara Volume 1 was a cute slice of life VN to pass the time and relax. I might pick up the rest of the series when it is on sale.
protip: turn boob bounciness to max, u won't regret
Lets be honest if you're even looking at the reviews you know what you want. And this game will give it to you. Enjoy your ascent from humanity my friend.
[table][code] [td] [code] Why pay money for a real date  when you can just pay $10 on Steam to get nekos for lyfe!!!!! [/code] [/td] [/code][/table]
good day, my name is connor. i am a huge fan of this game series  or was until the massive flaw has arisen like demons from the depths of the abyss that is my soul after i found this truly heart breaking bug, i have met all the criteria and cannot get the steam achievement clearing the first chapter. this has truly destroyed my entire life and will to live. when purchasing this game i had hopes all my educational needs would be met however i have been met with massive disappointment. to truly rectify this issue i would like a body pillow of my favourite cat girl maple. i hope this request can be met but if not i would accept the achievement reluctantly. may your day be met with love and nekogirls :hearts:.
My friend got it for me i swear...  Bestfive minutes of my life to write this crappy review  10/10 Would purchase for friend  The age restriction on this is a lie
Cant stop playing with locking the door <3 <3
Lemmie tell you the lore in this world is pretty rich
You get to pet cat girls.
As a true cat lover, I must say I have never trained my bisceps harder.
This game is just a waste of money. I've ran out of five rolls of tissues and two bottles of lotions during my entire playtime.
Cute game.
my parents got disappointed
very kawaii neko waifus 12/10 recommend
[strike] Waste of time [/strike]  10/10 gameplay experience
The only bad thing that ever came out of Taiwan, really.
Much more interesting then Vol. 0, though it was disapointing that there were no choices to make.  I really enjoy stories that let you influence the ending.  I would recommend this one though.
best game ever
I've had fun playing this game one-handed.
Anime is a curse from Satan to steal our precious seed The govenment is controling you through chemtrails They're turning the frickin' frogs gay OPEN YOUR EYES SHEEPLE  10/10 got harder than Dark Souls
Just get a FAKKU account dumbass
Alright backed with the tissue!
Be right back, buy more tissue
Amazing artwork, Characters & story, also their catgirls, so bonus points!
Highest quality bounciness you can get for $10
NEKOPARA Vol.1 is even better than the first .0! In this version you get to get close with Chocola and Vanilla :3 You learn more about them and get to experience a lot of time with them <3 Two things you can't do (unless there's a special way to do so) you can't pet or <p> booby jump lol. Overall, I would recommend this version extremely!
help me
High Quality Art High Quality Story High Quality Neko's ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) High Quality Oppai Bounciness ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  U can have sex with a catgirls ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Very Good Game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 69/10 would pet the Neko's again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
cinnamon best girl
It only took over eight years to get these two perfect catgirls of the Minazuki family into a visual novel to really bring them to life, and that's excactly what NEKOWORKs' gals do with this game's animated sprites and voice acting. Though it's relatively short for a visual novel, and kinetic to boot I feel the quality of these sweet catgirls makes up for it. Depending on how long you've been a fan of Sayori's art this is a welcomed event regardless.   Just a heartfelt little romp where Chocola and Vanilla set out to help their master run his Cafe/Bakery whether he wants it or not! With some eroge thrown in there too if you get the patch.
For the one who wants to have a pure cat-loving experience just like me, this is the best version to play.I guarantee everything in game is just fantastic as a novel.      Also add a forewarning for attaching patches, plz DO NOT try to attach a patch of unlocking something. If you are not prepare for it, or you only wanna play a pure galgame, don't do it for a try. Otherwise you may get angry or even worse, for a scene that you absolutely don't want to see or a feeling that your dream girlfriend is on the bed with someone not you.
nyaaaaaaa~
BEST FUCKING GAME I EVER PLAYED BEST MMORPG IVE EVERPLAYED CHARACTER CUSTIMZATION IS OFF THE CHARTS VERY INTENSE GAME!
Hello my name is Aaden Girard and I approve of this game. Thank you for reading
:chocola:
I used to not have this game. Now I don't have my parent's respect. Let's see what I lose with Vol. 2
Lel ma P key broke while playing  ok obligatory joke out of the way   I really enjoyed my time playing Nekopara.  Music: there are only a grand total of like 4 songs but they all fit the mood for the scenes and they are well composed.  i give it a 7/10 (numbers help right ? )  Gameplay: it plays like your typical diablo eg, *click* *click* *click* *click*, yeah there isn't much gameplay the clicking is just a way to "turn the page"  i give it as many buttons as my mouse has 7/10  Story: Ya'll know i play this for the plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) , but no the story is quite well for my illiterate self, with you first resenting the girls and then growing on them.  i give it a 8/10  Humor: Oh yeah thats a category.I found the game to be quite entertaining with it getting a few chuckles and some normal laughs out of me  Since humor is subejctive i give it a 6/9  Art: Yeah err the art is great.  10/10  Technical aspect: The game had quite a few techinical option for me to choose like setting the chest bouncheiness higher or lower, changeing the language mid session, various options of saving loading and the quick versions of it, text speed,text brightness, effects and full screen and window mode.   i give it a 8/10  in short buy it, Nyan
emmm，nice……
Help
Fuck it. I'm going to die alone anyway.
Best game ever 10/10. The story is amazing, the characters are extremely lovable and the sex scenes make me nut in seconds. 11/10 would f̶a̶p̶ play again.
this fps is probably one of the best fps's ive played to this very day! Better than the black ops franchise!
This is not a funny hentai meme game...   It's a test of strength
Anyone else getting issues trying to get the "Try playing it in English!" Achievement? I have tried countless options, reinstalled the game and still I can't get it... Any solutions?

The story is fine, the characters are good. As someone that is not into anime, it has got my interest but just realize what your getting yourself into. Its creepy anime afterall *wink* *wink*
The main antagonist is censorship.
So I beat this game or more like Visual Novel. Usually, I dont see games on a high critical level, but this was a game I had some on. It was highly favoured and since I had some money left for the holiday sale, I said "why not?" and bought it. Many people told me "buy it, it's good, you won't regret it!" If I can share these people's opinion...we'll see.  TL;DR: 5/10. Definetly needs to be better to be actually worth 10€  The game looks very good, the graphics are (what I call them) "modern-anime-style" and with that absolutly good. It's fun reading the dialogues and it felt kind of good reading the whole thing. But this is where probelms start: The story is (imo) way too narrow, it's exactly how I expected the story to go. This happens, they do this as rection. I give you some spoiler-examples *SPOILERS AHEAD* [spoiler]The master has fun with this cat girls, he thinks, since it's a common thing to have catpanions,  loving them is ok. He gets ill, the girls help him by going out, the obligatory drama "we forgot our bells at home! we swear we belong to somebody!"[/spoiler] *SPOILER END* I tried to keep my expectations as low as possible since this is my first visual novel. But by doing exactly what I think's gonna happen...at least you dont make me completly satisfied. I do not want to say the story is bad at all! For what the story is, it's alright and enjoyable. A little thing that I didnt like that much, but isnt a big game breaker at all: (again, what I thought) You have all those adorable, beautiful catgirls and yet you get to experience what happens with 2 of them? This is where I gotta ask: Will we know more about the others in other Nekoparas? If no, then this is absolutly not ok imo. I'd really like to know more about Coconut or Cinnamon (tits yuheeeeeeee) If yes...well, the typical way to provide the user his information: We make a whole new game/story for some money. I dont want to say that is a bad thing, but I remember ye olden days where we got our stuff for free or we got games where we had so many stories in one game that we could play it for a massive amount of hours and we still didnt know anything. (yet again, I dont want to say the story is bad) But for focusing on 2 characters, the story is quite good.  Another thing I have to mention: The H-patch. Yes, there is one. you get hentaiscenes as you further progress through the game IF YOU HAVE THE H-PATCH DOWNLOADED UND INSTALLED. Google "nekopara vol 1 h-patch" and read the instructions carefully. that's it. Another thing to mention: If you have the H-Patch installed, you should be able to see if the H.Patch works if Chocola and Vanilla feel hot and it pretty much leads in an obvious way to the H-scenes What can I say about the scenes? They are well made, I actually didnt expect moving scenes tbh! But the sounds were...well, you can hear that the game isn't focusing on the H-scenes. But as a sweet, little addition, I enjoyed them (no, I did not (yet) masturbate to them).  Overall, I give the game a 5/10. But imo, I wouldn't pay 10€ for it. Maybe 7, let's say 5. But 10€ is way too much. Maybe I just had too high expectations, who knows.  Play the game for yourself and get your own opinion! In the end, it's just me who thinks this way :)
Shamelessly beat my meat to this game after shamelessly adding in the 18+ content. 10/10 gnarly fap!
good
I consider myself a man, but holy fuck did i tear up in just the first chapter....I have forever become weak and vunerable to these Nekos, they have officially made me their bitch. God im lonley :)
i came...then i downloaded the H-scenes patch.
Ok so after playing the entire game for 6 hours in the what I would call "big boi" verson of the game (Its the 18+ patch.) I would say this is actually really good and draws you in but when you look back on it you will say to yourself "holy s**t I am a f**king weeb and I need to kill myself before humanity kills me for being a degenerate!" If you watch anime play this game and then do what I did and rethink your life.
Playing the full version, it's a fun, light VN with enough world building for you to get the idea whenever you're not getting the real idea.  Does enough to tug at the heart strings when it doesn't tug at something else.  There's elements that are certainly creepy, but one would probably assume no one really goes into this for the story as much as they go in for the fantasy fulfilling plot and world setting.  At least if not for any other reason than to fight off the ever encroaching feeling of loneliness or existential dread.
Im gonna finish this game before i end myself
I don't want to kill myself anymore, thanks devs.
This game has been around for awhile and I bought it for the meme's. But when I played it I was genuinly surprised by how much effort and care was put into this game. I as played the game I slowly became more interested in the quirky cast of characters and found I had been playing/reading for over an hour. I'm glad I bought this on sale and I plan on finishing it. I can see why it has a cult following. The cast of characters really make this game fun and enjoyable.
2 cat
THIS SHOULD REPLACE THE BIBLE
Is this hentai or something...
okay game. could literally feel the disgust radiating from my friends list.
If playing this game is wrong then I don't want to be right.
I enjoyed the voice acting and art quality the most but i appriciate that everything is woven into the story very well without just being pointless.
An amazing visual novel. It takes 2nd place in my heart after ChuSingura. The artstyle is really cute. The choices of theme songs is excellent. The story is interesting and well written. It has ups and downs so it isn't a simple everything-is-perfect-and-all kind of story. This episode centers around the youngest members of the Minaduki family Chocola and Vanila who happen to be twins. Chocola is a really energetic and cute catgirl whose honesty and innocance is just dangerously moe and makes your heart melt. She always acts childish but once becoming Kashou's catpanion she sometimes become really lewd. Vanila seems lazy but is actually hard-working and while she may not be too honest about her feelings it only makes her more lovable. She acts really mature and she loves joking around. She especially loves pointing out what a "pervy pastry puffer" Kashou is. Taking everything into consideration i can't really say anything negative about all this. Definetly worth a 10/10.
If you love cats -> play this game. If you hate cats -> play this game to love cats.
Remember always press "P"
VANILLA BEST GIRL
Good game get plox
Fun read and a fun experience. It's pretty simple story wise for a VN but it is quite fun still.
Anime is trash and so am I
people like stories
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) buy it
So are they like slaves or what?
I was searching for "first person shooting" games on steam, then I saw Nekopara, what can i say? :)
I'd like to give my thanks to the people who have kept me entertained for many hours of fun: the glorious collection of nutcases who have made the Nekopara review section an absolute joy to read. Never have I seen such a wonderful collection of minature literary masterpieces. I want to let you all know that your efforts are greatly appreciated.  The game's alright, I guess. Not exactly my cup of tea. Also, the default chest bounciness is set a little too high.
I lost my dignity to this.  You know what? Buy this.  Because why?  CATS. A FUCKING CATS.
love it, but this game would become more good if theyre not cut anything
Picked it up since it was a best seller and on-sale. The further I got into the story the louder I heard Michael Jordan say "Stop it. Get some help." Anyways, if you're into incest and beastiality you're in luck. It's basically a book, so you don't get to make any choices which for me got uncomfortable. That being said, the graphics and voice acting are good and the english subtitles are better than I expected and the transition between scenes is smooth and fun. So props to the devs, artists, and translators. Just out of my comfort zone.
One question: Who the f**k makes theese games and why? im not complaining but I need to know.  And BTW this game is great.
The Steam version skips over all nudity,X-rated content. If you want that, you have to go to the developer's web site to download the content patches for the Steam version of the game, OR you can download the full, X-rated version from the developer site. It's a little dicey getting to the English language site, and the files are so big each one is split into three parts.  That being said, I totally enjoyed it, and wound up purchasing all three. Graphics are VERY good, and I found myself laughing my head off at the spirited voice acting from the six catgirl actors.
The Cory In the House Manga was Better, So dissapointed that there weren't any Fucking Chips when I went to My cabinet to PLay this game, Like what a joke, Game is Missing Bobs and Vagene too.
Nice animation,interesting story line,good voice actors and it's so easy that u can play it with one hand!
Look I don't gotta tell you why I got this game. We all KNOW why I got this game.
It gets better every volume! Same rules apply, play when home alone or lock the door to your room.
this game make my weiner hard
I'm going to hell, and I'm going to enjoy it when I get there.
I feel dirty for having bought this game.  ... Welp, might as well embrace it, buying the bundle!!
I don't have a life c':  In all seriousness, this is a nice visual novel. It has many lewd tendencies, and a lot of fan service. But if you don't patch it, it's a nice little visual novel experience with cute catgirls.  It has a cute soundtrack and characters (duh)  But uh.. Shigure is pretty creepy around protag. if you are bored/sad and want a cute visual novel to cheer you up or keep you occupied, this one is for you.  (this goes for vol. 0-3)
wtf im a pedo now
Was super cute n fun to play. Would recommend ☆

Steam wouldn't refund even though I haven't played 2 hours just say I have owned it to lonand thats right I do not wish to own this game it is terrible, sexualized content consisting of still pctures, do not buy
[b]NEKOPARA Vol.1[/b] is a light visual novel (VN) about two "catgirls" working in their owner's new cafe. The game defines earlier on "catgirls" as the "genetically modified human-feline hybrids" which are kept as pets. They are also required to wear an IAP (Independent Action Permit) item fitted with a GPS tracker, such as a bell, if they want to go outdoors without their owners (after passing "The Test").   + High quality art style with a lot of attention to detail + Entertaining voice overs (Japanese language) + Some catchy songs + Steam achievements and trade cards  - Very simple, straightforward and unintelligent plot for a VN - The sub par plot (in comparison to the visuals) offers no alternative paths choices, thus no replayability - Unless you are a "catgirl" fan, the storyline was bordering on uncomfortable - Some small glitches, i.e. black screen, no video for end credits etc - No achievements accomplishment; they dutifully drop after each chapter (+config change options)  Note: The review is for the standard steam version of NEKOPARA Vol.1, which even though it has a couple suggestive depictions, there is no adult material within (requires the purchase of external DLC to activate the explicit scenes).  ----- TL;DR: [b]NEKOPARA Vol.1[/b] strictly as a visual novel, suffers from a short, unintelligent and shallow plot but in contrast the high quality visuals, art and catchy songs perhaps will justify a purchase, especially at a reduced sales price.
NEKOPARA is a sorta okay game if you can call it that. It's not bad but I feel it should be called an animated comic. Nothing about it is bad but I was under the impression before I bought it there would be choices and routes for each of the cat girls. So I can't really judge it by a mistake on my part but I will say there is more interaction in the options menu than the actual gameplay itself. It took me about 4-5 hours of cumulitve play of a few sittings to complete it. I got bored listening to cat girls squeel and pressing spacebar after about an hour each time. If you like Kawaii/Moe type Anime this should be right up your alley, If not I would pass on this one.   Pros: - Kawaii - Well written - Art is superb.  Cons: - The most linear game I've ever played.
yes
Don't buy it. please.
I love this visual novel. I love the girls. I love the art style. I'm a huge forever fan of this series <3
Okay, so, uh... yeah.  I bought this game sort of on a whim, and my initial thought process was "I've heard this was basically hentai so, being the type of person who is entertained by witnessing some depraved shit, I'm gonna get all 4 volumes and see what the deal is."  Naturally I discovered that's not all there was to it. I was missing something. Yes, indeed:  THE 18+ DLC.  I bought it after a great deal of mental preparation and hesitation. I regret nothing.  I'll start by giving a simple pro/con list for the steam version of the game, the "All-Ages" version.  PROS: -Breathtaking art style, fluent animations and excellent attention to detail. Easily one of the most beautifully crafted VNs I've seen or played. Of course, I'm also just a sucker for anime. Sue me. -The voiceovers, while entirely in Japanese, are excellent. Delivery is great, display of emotion is great, and the actresses fit their characters well, with clear differences in tone, pitch and delivery. -The story, while basically just a slice-of-life with some deeper elements thrown in, grips you well enough that you want to keep going (pun intended, you'll know why later.) -Characters are all interesting, some more than others, but you won't dislike a single one. Even Shigure, who has a rather uncomfortable big brother complex going on. -The soundtrack is upbeat when it needs to be, solemn when it doesn't. There's a pleasant mix of piano tracks and poppy, electronic tracks, along with some more traditional anime-like tracks with a jazzy vibe.  CONS: -The dialogue and general script, as is unfortunately the case with almost all JP > EN translations, fails to deliver a truly realistic representation of how one would speak in English. Things like "Ahh..." or "That's not...!" Some people might not consider this a con, especially since the characters all speak, meaning the text should be a true translation. More of a personal quirk I suppose. -Minor typos here and there. Easy to miss, honestly. -The story, due to the nature of it, lacks tragedy. Fortunately, everything else is delivered well enough that this may only be a setback for some. Still figured I'd mention it.   NOW THEN... Allow me to move on to the FULL version of the game, which I have. This pro/con list is strictly going to cover what the 18+ dlc (re)introduces. I won't be graphic in order to keep my review readable, but I will be detailed enough to get the point across  PROS: -Since the H-scenes were done by the same artist, the comment I made about the art style applies here as well. -The scenes are exaggerated, but not to the point of just not making any sense. If you're not getting what I'm saying, let's just say instead of the girls looking like they just hopped out of the ocean, they look like they maybe fell in a puddle or... something. -THEY ARE ANIMATED -The entire scene is voiced (Minus Kashou of course). This can be a con if you're the type that can't handle the sound of a voice actress making rather realistic sexual sounds. -Again, not much of a hentai guy, but the scenes are really well done for what they are. Not much else to say really... at the end of the day, you're paying $30 for hentai.  CONS: -Again, with the translations, shit doesn't always make sense. Without being specific, sometimes word usage in certain "situations" is off-putting. Even thought the VAs may REALLY be saying these things, it's still a little uncomfortable to read. Again, I'm not usually a hentai kind of dude, so it could just be me. -Frequency is... well, frequent. Vol. 1 alone, after the initial 3-4 hours of introductory story, probably has a scene every 45 minutes of play time. There are 3 scenes. The 3rd lasts well over an hour. I only list this as a con because it sort of makes you feel like the game goes from a story-driven experience with some porn thrown in for taste, to a straight up H-VN with a little bit of story mixed in. -There is almost ALWAYS some kind of wet/sticky sound effect going on in the background. Sometimes it's fine, but for the most part it's just gross. I recommend either turning down the sound effects or turning them off entirely unless you enjoy the sound of macaroni that's been sitting for a while being spooned around.  With all of that being said, the game is super adorable. ESPECIALLY Chocola and Vanilla... even if they end up being defiled halfway through the game. Feelsbadman.  If you've gotten this far, congrats, you know what to expect. If you're looking for a TL;DR, here it is:  11/10 Catgirls are cute, there's hentai if you blow (giggity) the extra $30, the game is pretty, buy it now no regrats.
fun cute game that is not for the weak of heart.  i love this series and recommend it to those who feel that they would like this type of weeb or otaku type stuff
nekos.... nuff said.
yes.
I'm not a prude ,i know fantasies and reality are 2 different things , but this game is just sick! It tries to make you care about these "catgirls" like they are your cute kids but then spends forever on convoluted monologues that try to explain why it's logical to go to bed naked with them! I see nothing but good reviews for this game but apart from the visuals everything is mediocre - the music is meh , the story ridiculous and the speech either badly translated or written by a japanese dude who hasn't spoken to a real person since the day he tried to rape his sister - avoid
Cat Pedophilia vol. 1
These catgirls changed my life
Surprisingly full of spirit and emotion for a game where you fuck catgirls... assuming you have the 18+ patch.
Pretty much the definition of moe and heartwarming story. And also the revolution of character animations in visual novels.  The story isn't anything special but I can guarantee you will love both Chocola and Vanilla characters after playing this game. Cuteness of those catgirls knows no bounds.
10/10 masterpiece, would play again.
Hard to play with only one hand...          Jk. I'm not that desperate....yet.
[h1]This visual novel is arguably the best in the whole series.[/h1]   [b]The unwavering devotion of Chocola to her master alone just melted me.[/b]   [b]Why cant real girls be like this......they'd be happier, and so would guys be. Its a win win. All they wanna do is complain,  and snatch your wallet, and fuck other guys behind your back. So then man created the ultimate woman.......THE WAIFU.......however, waifus are confined to the world of anime and 2D. One day, we will have sex robots, and when that day comes, I'll certainly keep nekopara in mind for how I'd want a sex robot for myself. :3[/b]
Im wet
its a wonderful game and they are all so kawaii that my heart beats alot XD
A family comedy shows us a lovely family. the story between each member bring us fun and rejoice. Master between pets, pet between pet. all the story content are worth to enjoy. This game is worthy, hope you all are enjoy in it. enjoy in this game with fully, fully love around this big family. worthy to play with elder in your family.    [spoiler] chocola & vanilla made me C U M 66 times in 8 hours [/spoiler]
Just like NEKOPARA Vol. 0, it's got easy achievements to get for achievement hunters out there like myself plus semi nude cat girls, what more could you ask for?
Hentai.
Thicc
This game is great and I have no regrets
The best fps game on steam!
I Enjoy Breasts but this game barely had Breasts but breasts are breasts so its 10/10
Fun way to spend a few hours
T'was quite nice, t'was even a bit hot.
Eccchh...  This is the worst example of effort-porn I've ever seen. What is effort porn you may ask? It's a term I coined to describe interactive pornographic material designed to give lonely fuckers like me a sense of accomplishment and heightened sexual release once the game reaches it's climax, (Fuck the female). These types of games achieve that goal by stringing the player through a series of narrative loops and building up a connection between Fuckee & Fucker.   The loops are usually just red-herrings for sex scenes, making the player constantly go "Ooo, Ooo Is this it?!?" Only to be denied that and shoved back into the plot of the game.  Then finally, after (Hopefully not any longer than an hour) of degrading yourself by placing yourself in the narrative and building sexual desire for whatever animated titty creatures star in the game, You make a hefty withdrawal and bust a nut stronger, and more fierce than an average "Meh" Pornhub nut. Because of the time spent and the effort secreted, Your psyche views it as a more genuine experience, Making you feel slightly less lonely for a few minutes.  This game though... Oooo this game...  I just wanted to masturbate but I just kept getting angry at the poorly structured narrative.  TAKE A WRITING CLASS.  The entire fucking game is written like the cancerous "Comedy" scenes in Anime.  "WOOOAAHH!!! WACCKKY!!! HE'S A TOTAL P E R V !! WACCCKKYYY!! WOAAAHHH!!"  And the game's attempts at... Ugh... "Dramatic storytelling" Come off as just so thinly veiled and contrived because of both the absolutely PITIFUL dialogue combined with the knowledge that this is all just supposed to be backing for nuttage.  And the first TWO HOURS of the game completely focuses around this trash!  If you're gonna spend two hours in a jack-off game on Sex-free narrative, At least try and make it interesting! Why not have animal control try and take the two main "Catgirls"? Why not have there be some threat to the Bakery staying open?... OR SOMETHING!?  I feel like a dingus recommending serious plot points for a game about cumming inside cats but if they're gonna take that route anyway, Why wouldn't they at least try and interest me?... Instead of boring me to the point of physical pain with stories about how sentimental the cat people are, Or how much the main character's sister loves him. Jesus Christ, WHO CARES?!?!? JUST LET ME CUM!!!  And then the cherry on the motherfucking cat-vomit covered cake... They cut out the fucking sex scenes.  I'll be the first one to admit, I was goddamn hot and ready when they started the set up to the release. Thinking all the fucking hell of dealing with the horrid narrative was at least going to result in a top quality nut... Then it cut out.  ...What?... I was heavily confused.  Next thing you know, The screen fades into the living room of the main characters.  ...No.  (QUE OVERLY PRODUCED HAPPY MUSIC) WOOOAHHH!!! KOOOKY HIJINKS!!!!)  I turned the game off and cried.  I spent 4 hours belittling myself and didn't even get to have a good wank. Fucking pitiful. Go buy HuniePop.  3/10
Alright, so watashi told by the bakas from Sekai Project to purchase this gameu, since watashi very fond of neko grills and detailed plots. The gameu desu had sugoi graphics, despite my shoddy graphics card. The visual novel played fine, but then watashi thought to myself--nani if watashi was a neko shounen?   Would watashi just be like a neko? Would watashi lick my balls? Would watashi cough up hairballs? Would watashi be a pain in the balls? Balls?  Ah! Gomen'nasai! Gomen'nasai! (⋟﹏⋞)  Watashi did not mean for kono review to become lewd. Chocola-sensei is quite the tsundere so watashi must not speaketh out of turn. N-not that watashi likes calling Chocola 'sensei'... baka ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ  Vanilla was the number ichi waifu in kono gameu, her curves made my lewd brain think of naughty things!!! (⁰ ◕〜◕ ⁰) Watashi imagined about half-way through the gameu nani if Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki came rushing in with Rena Ryuguu's axe from Higurashi no Naku koro ni to chop Vanilla in half Yandere-style. (ʘᗩʘ’) But Yuno is with Yukii so ╰(◕ᗜ◕)╯  It fascinated me as soon as watashi launched the gameu that there were ni save file locations!!! Watashi was like 'KORE WA?' and watashi gasped!!!  Maple-senpai looked so lewd in that maid outfit watashi just couldn't hide my skeevy eyes!!! ╰(”◕﹏◕”)つ *bows* Gomen'nasai! Gomen'nasai!   Still, my favourite anime is Sword Art Online cos I gave it a 10/10, demo Nekopara gets a 9.9/10.  Shout-out to Google-sensei for giving us visual novels.  Sayonara~~~ ╰(˵ヘωヘ✿)╯
My family disowned me after finding out that I like cat girls. Thank you Nekopara.
Very good
0/10 This version censored all the fun bits.
NEKOPARA is a VN based on Pantheon becoming what he wanted, except his personal space was invited by his family's Nekos*. Instead of filing a restraining order, he keeps them with him.  The VN novel itself is mediocre at best, with a few key elements. First, it's one of the few VN's to be animated, and not some pictures wired up (Though at parts, there are pictures, though this is obvious). Another key element is that the VNs are Voice-Acted (VA), thus bringing in MORE spirit.  One of the main attractions for me, however, was that the game contains hentai. To get the uncensored version you either: -A: Pay for the uncensored version online, and apply a patch to the Steam version -B: Pirate said patch -or C: Buy the uncensored version online, then set it to be a Steam game.  The main problem is that the game lures you with hentai, should you be a fan of hentai, and then makes you pay an extra 10 dollars, which just screams BS.  One of the problems I've had that's very common with the game is ''Invalid character AE''. If you don't want to deal with said problem, install the VN on C: instead of D:.  Verdict: A VN that is definitely worth checking, but pay online or pirate the patch for the hentai.  Final Verdict: 7/10 for the base VN, 8/10 for the hentai parts. The hentai parts did not feel empty, yay.
how do i hide games from friends
This is honestly the game I play when I'm feeling blue. The upliting story really kelps me feel better, also anime tiddies

10/10, would be emotionally coerced into sleeping with nine-months-old anthropomorphic house pets again...? :s  Slightly more seriously speaking, I've probably approached this game from an unusual angle, as I wasn't looking for porn and didn't download the 18+ patch, but I knew how much praise the whole series gathered over the years and wanted to check it out for myself. What I found was:  + Absolutely beautiful visuals, with sprites, CGs, Backgrounds... Everything being georgeous. + Awesome scripting with animated sprites done maybe better than anywhere else, creating a lively experience you wouldn't expect from a VN. + Tons of cuteness and adorableness. + Good music.  But also:  - Extremely creepy owner/pet romance that made me uncomfortable even without seeing the H-scenes. - Creepy brocon subplot with the protagonist's little sister (who would be otherwise an adorable character). - Paper-thin story and absurd setting that doesn’t really try making sense. - Writing generally not on par with the visual quality.  [b]As a kinetic novel, it was definitely well-produced and fun to read, but not really exceptional in anything but the graphics. If I looked on it as porn, I think the power dynamic and characteristics of the catgirls (especially Chocola) really makes it quite horrible. If you don't get discouraged by this description though, you should have a blast with this and all the other chapters of the series. I don't judge. Or at least I try not to...[/b]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Oh, hey, I bought the whole series during the autumn sale? I guess it'd be a waste to not out check where it goes from here...  ...what am I doing with my life? o.o
I was promised a catgirl café. Wasn't disappointed.
Was okay  Downloaded R18+ files  Now is ver okay  10/10
lowkey teasing
Wow Coming from playing every Sakura game on the market (the free ones too), the amount of effort that is put into these games is astounding. It's amazing, the soundtrack, story, and characters. Also, if you didn't know, there is a purchasable patch on D e n p a s o f t .com, so I'd recommend it entirely. It's amazing, and that's that. Buy it, it's worth a ton more than $11 CAD
neko jiggle tiddies. 10/10
Everyone just message me when I play ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A cat is fine too.
OMG!  Just finished chapter one and i absolutly fell in love with this VN!  I Will never regret spending the money i did for this game!  If u love VN's As much as I do. Then I highly recomend you check this out OMG!  The Story just i9n chapter one along is absolutly bueatiful!  I  rate  this  10/10 hands down!
A friend decided to troll me geez what an asshole. Well it will be a shame not to play it after he bought it to me. Of course for research purpose.....
Ayy, who doesn't like some cute catgirls? Also very nice hentai
My family might think im a loser, but i know im the real winner being surrounded by all these kawaii neko ladies , anyway i need more paper...
I play it for the story.          ...
It's okay I'm ashamed of myself as well
MY LOVE FOR NEKO GIRLS HAS INCREASED !!!!!!!!!!!!
One-handed gaming is the future.
great game of great franchise visual novel. I love the story and [b]cat[/b] too....
If you love cute girls, and especially cute [i]catgirls[/i] this you can't go wrong with Nekopara.  The game is overflowing with adorable catgirls, and the story is interesting and funny.
I spent money on this

This is is a mistake.... But I LOVE IT!

What are you waiting for? (´・ω・`)
One of my favorite visual novels. Vanilla is the best neko of all. If you do not share that taste, I'm sorry to say but you have a shitty taste
Mind the gap.  I give it 10 out of 10
Made my heart all fluffy and full of moe~ <3  The artwork is really awesome, and the voice acting is adorable!  Update: Nominated it for the no apologies steam award, because I won't apologize to anyone for enjoying this! 8D
It's so cute!
Contains lots of cute cat girls.  Your life will forever be changed by playing this game.  There would be peace on Earth if real life were just 1/10 as cute as this.  You have been warned.  Nuff said...
Jiggle physics
10/10 would bang cat girl again.
#OniichanApproved! if someone has called you a Weaboo/Otaku before, than odds are you already own this game, and are just here to try to rationalize your bizarre infatuation for two lovely catgirls named Vanilla and Chocola<3 d(^.^)b
im here to suck underage cat  c o  c k
These games are trash and so am I.
Played this without my pants on.....don't judge me....   all in all, this should be the standard for all visual novels on Steam, you know. minus the PG forced changes. Gabe. . . . . . listen. . . . . . you can delay Half Life 3 for countless years. but never.....NEVER! take away my ability to rub one out to clearly and absolutly "19+yr" old catgirls..
Greatest game of all time. The end.

Bought it due to memes!! Went through the weirdest journey ever!!

Best Game Ever
Vanilla Best Waifu
It's time.
i see catgirls i buy the fcking game
The characters in Nekopara are way too cute. Each have their own unique personalities, which are easy to get attached to. From an artistic standpoint, this game is also fantastic. While there aren't necessarily any branching storylines or choices, I never really considered this a negative aspect of the game, just a wanted addition. I'd definitely recommend you pick up Vol.0 to get a feel for the game and see if it's something you'd enjoy. Also the 18+ patch for Vol.1-Vol.3 adds quite a bit to the overall game - and lets be honest, that's what we're intrested in. However, you have to purchase these from the developer's site "Denpasoft" and they're quite expensive.
I have lost all sense of self. This game has consumed my ego. It is all I have left.    10/10 would press P again
Friends < Cat girls
This is one of those games that's pretty messed up when you think about it, but that doesn't matter because it's so fun and makes you so happy when you play it.
Cute Nekos <3 Much Better with 18+ version, not only you get to see the complete scenes but you also understand the story much better.
One of those games you are to embarrassed to say you play. Well...let's download a certain patch now...
best 10 dollars ive spent
It's better than I expected, I was abble to connect with the character in some shape or form... If you know what I mean.
I have some cats at home, hoping them to turn into catgirls and start a pâtissier with me.. hell nice 11/10 would find more cats
probably the single greatest game of my time!
Suck anime, wow
My cat walked in the room when i was playing this game and ever since then, I don't need a girlfriend anymore. 10/10 game
Cute nekos doing cute things.
BEST GAME
NEED MORE AHEGAO!!
Catgirls is life, catgirls is love.  What more can you expect?
good arm workout material. very relaxing to play too.
Cat.
How can you say no to cute cat girls.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
jiggle
What a beautiful paradise
Catgirls are gods gift to earth.
Easier than getting a GF
muh dikk
I just died from moes and bombarbments of cuteness.   Recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Vahalla sooner.
Maybe you're looking for more Waifu. I recommended This.
I would have liked for the cats to fuck but they don't
It's hard to sit on the bus, or study in class, knowing I have relentlessly banged loli catgirls   ...    But it still makes me smile.   nyan/10
Good
before I played this game in a illegal way, but now, I decide to buy it. No matter how many times I played,this game keep impressed me.this game is not noly just a 'FPS" game, but also a story of family that can impressed all most of everyone.Cherishing  all people  around you,and,do not regret when you lose them. waiting for NEKOPARA'S OVA.
This game change my life... pls add ova to steam pls
The world is grim enough, let us all [spoiler] h u g [/spoiler] catgirls!
Buy this if you like the any of following things : Catgirls Cats Cute girls Animals Anime Japanese Culture Female ( Just kidding xD )  You wil not regret. 11/10 will play it single-handly again.  Anyways , getting the R(17+1) version to replace in the directory with the -steam=yes command in launch option is a basic knowledge to all smart gamers. Enjoy. Go get some tissues in order to play it single-handly.  EDIT : All old pirated uncensor patches stopped working since they patched it. Either you torrent an old version, or you buy the uncensor patch from denpasoft.
good vn c-cute art sasuga sayori
Wear headphones and lock your doors for a good 2-3 hours, Install the patch to make your experience even better yet riskier.
Would you a cat?
Well, I don't know what I expected...  UPDATE: Still, nope.
Adorable cast of QT-3.1415 catgrills, all with unique personalities.  Coconut/10  Nekopara volume 3 has been released as of now, it's still amazing.
[b]Traps are not gay[/b]
<3 nya~
If you didn't like Vanilla before, now you will  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
Its actually the best visual novel I have played yet and I have played many... too many .. Still recommend it tho. Defnietly download the patch makes the game longer cause you got all the extra scenes so... Ye its nice go get it and while youre at it get the other 3 games aswell and the vr game ... Do it just like me
No regrets.
Cat lolis are all i need
yes nice catgirl sex
Catgirls? yes
THEY BOUNCE
its good
It has catgirls do i need to say anymore
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Why not
A visual novel about anthromorphized cat girls with player as the owner. If you like cute things, vanilla content and absolutely no tragedy story, this visual novel is for you.
Vote for these cats again!
Kawaii
BEST FPS FOREVER!
nc game
The deep storyline, the character development, the tiddies.. this game has it all (Coconut best girl)
good
Nyaa~~~~~ Nyaaa~~~~
There is no guilt here. Only pleasure.
i love neko
Still gotta get past 1 hour in it one day
Welcome to Weeb World
[h1][i]I never reget a single peny buying this game, Meow~ Beside the emotional story you get to see a bunch of kawaii nyangirl how good can it be, meow~[/i][/h1]
Literally the greatest game series ever to be put on steam
Nyaa.
All you need to know is that there is baking, catgirls, romance, and jiggle physics. Lots and LOTS of jiggle physics
nyaa?
good
Rule34
Just writing a review for The Steam Awards. But get this game.
NEKO IS LOVE! CHOCOLA IS LIFE!
Fapopara is a very gud gaem totally didnt get it cause of kinky H+ catgirls
it's a lovely game about catgirls and you can play it for all ages or r-18, the only bad thing is that you need to purchase the r-18 patch even when you already purchased the game in steam but still it has a great story
good
u wil regret buy this....
This game has catgirls. What else could you ask for?
There are cute girls... that are also cute cats. And they love you (well, the protagonist, actually). Need something more?  If you just want to chill out and relax, this VN is well worth your money. If you want a serious story with deep meaning... you'd better change page :)
nyaa
meow meow meow
Worth the money. Especially with the optional add-on from DenpaSoft.  Update: My brother keeps giving me the judging look, but I don't care. These Nekos are all I need; they are my family now.
So Sweety:3
Nyaaa for unique group would love this VL. Its a fun game were you play as the protagonist that owns a bakery and cat people nekos exist.
cute catgirls what's not to like?
Have you ever think about how many African children are dying of starvation every day? Me neither, but this game is good. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good game with topkek nekos. Good for playing one handed. Watch the OVA every night to understand the Lore better.
God is real. And he smiles when he sees Nekopara playing in my basement.My family may have deserted me because of this addiction, but I do not care, as Nekopara is my one and only true source of life. Without these beautiful bountiful babes, my life has no meaning. Nekopara is love, Nekopara is life. Infinity/10 - IGN
Sayori is my shepherd, she know what I want.
Good game played the better, non-steam version does not disappoint
jail never felt so good
its kawaii as fuck ^-^
A visual novel where you play as the owner of a group of cute catgirls. 10/10 would fap again.
Didn't know i can use my cats like this.
best game tbh
Love this game, recommend it at the strongest!
im here for tha tiddy
I picked "choices matter" when nominating... not in game choice but IRL choice.  the types of people that will haunt you or the types of people that blockes you or the timing to play this game from family... all this choices of games i have yet i chosed to play you . 10/10 play this game and make a bad choice IRL
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I have a life I swear.
It's been over a year since a finished this. I even played the other installments. But none of them had the same charm as the first.  NekoPara Vol.1 is my favorite VN all the ones I own. The Steam version to be exact (don't need any of that sinful material for my cute kitties). This is one of those things that just makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, makes you ready to cry, gives you emotions that make yo feel alive. I love this game and I recommend it to everyone who has even the slightest otaku living in them.  Nekogrills 4 lyef!
It's just a Kinectic Novel (no choices to be made) about catgirls working on a pattisserie, of course there's going to be white cream involved.

very nice to see these characters get a VN series, even if they are ruined now
great game for your young ones
In nekopara you get to show off your love for catgirls, while also disappointing your whole family, even your dead ancestors.  But who cares? Nekopara is a game about you (Cashew), taking care of "innocent" catgirls who just want to please their master and help with this so called "La Soleil", but for some reason your cats have a disability and think that speaking loudly, fighting and being all-around useless helps. But you forgive them, because they're catgirls.  If you haven't played this game yet, you should definitely.
*Takes deep breath* FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  If someone asks me to define perfection, I will send them a link to this game.  Patch it for the intended experience.  10/10, will pet again.  Game of the year every year.
Maybe I'm a fool for wanting a good story out of my porn game, but this seemed to have a lot of potential in the beginning. Some 'will they/won't they' tension gets established early on, and it seemed the girls would have some depth, but that all evaporates quickly when a shockingly arbirary moment arrives an it's time for a forced sex scene.  The part of me that likes a good story walked away from this with blue balls.  ... The rest of me did not, but that's beside the point.
First thing you do is go to effect setting and turn on the boobie bounce physics to Max level. Well aye as you can see I start this game review with the exact same line as my previous Nekopara Vol.0 Review.   There is a nudity patch for this game available but strangely I would actually recommend against it.The main focus of this VN is really about cute, adorable cat girls and for the general mood of the game it’s really actually feel awkward to add too much ecchi content to it.   Great Anime graphics, All around lovable character, Simple and heart lighten story with a Cat Maid sweet cake store is already a very interesting VN to read and smile about.   There are a bit fan service here and there as typical shower scene, wet cloth Etc. but not as much as sakura series. It takes about one hours for each chapter if you read line by line slowly without skipping content.   Achievements are very simple to get. I had some trouble to getting my last language related achievement but once i reinstalled the game i got it fine.  8.5/10 would be my rating! IF you are a cat person that love cute girls this game is for you. If you are not a cat person that love cute girls try this and maybe you will change your mind.
Great VN... I have "no ragrets".  Not even a letter.
Vanilla best girl.
At first i didn't care, now this is a stain on my steam library, a stain you cant wash away. No matter how much bleach you use, i have nightmares about it, where i boot up windows, i open my steam about to play some portal 2. and i just see it there...  "38 hours played"  there are some mistakes you can't forget.
i got 7 messages instantly the moment i played this game. now i dont get any because i think people are scared to talk to me now
Nice game with good soundeffects and design. Gets a little boring 5 chapters (or something) into the game. Overall very good :D
NekoPara Volume 1 takes place from the perspective of a man named Kashou Minaduki, whom is part of a long line of Japanese confection makers. His sister has also been raising quite a few catgirls, some of whom have become attached to him over recent months and years. Seeking to forge his own path in the industry, Kashou decides to leave home and open his own patisserie by the name of “La Soleil” – completely in secret to avoid the attention of his family. Originally it was his plan to run this cafe by himself, without the assistance of either his family or any catgirls he left behind. But this all changes when he finds two unopened boxes sitting in the shop with some perplexing notices on them. The noises from the box show that two of the catgirls his sister was raising: the enthusiastic Chocola and more docile Vanilla, have decided to stay by his side and help run the shop. Although willing to send them back home at first, events that follow see him deciding to keep the two on board – as they begin their life of running La Soleil together.  + r18 patch + cute nekos + boobs bounciness (press "P" to see the magic)
Catgirls saved my life
This game has completely ruined my life. I was disowned by my dad once he saw me playing this game, I failed out of college because I could not study as I was so enthralled with the complex story. I am now living on the streets trying to get enough money to buy Vol. 3. I try to keep a positive mindset so I can live with the shame and dishonor I have brought my family. Even though this game has single handedly ruined my life, at least I have virtual catgirls.  10/10
Why pay money for a real date when you can just pay 9€ on steam to get Nekos 4 Life ┬┴┬┴┤ ͜ʖ ͡°) ├┬┴┬┴
Well, its exactley what it looks like. Do with this statment whatever you want.
It's a good game. The plot is amazing. 10/10 Would recommend for anyone
Trashier than I could have even imagined
Just go and buy this game. Trust me you wont regret it :)
Don't do it.
This is not a game. It's a story where the only interaction you have is clicking through the dialogue. The main character has sexual relations (not pictured in the Steam version) with cat-girls who arre around a year old... which seems a bit pedo/creepy to me.
Omae wa mou shinderu, waku waku!

FeelsGoodMan I only blew my load 30 times during the 2 hours I played though, and obvious pick for your kids or even your cats. 100/10
Everyday we stray away from the god
This game is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a video game. I played it as a joke, expecting something bad, but I was negatively surprised by just how terrible the concept and writing are.  It's no surprise that people like Elliot Rodger go on shooting sprees if they think this is what human interaction is like.
Anime was a mistake and so was I
I'm starting to regret th-SIKE! I DON'T REGRET THIS DECISION AT ALL.
This is a very well written visual novel about a man who, along with his sister, have many sexy and fuckable cat girls. And trust me you'll get the good good later so don't worry. Get the 18+ patch for a better experience if you know what I mean.
Cat girls are all you need
You need an incredibly advanced set of intellectual skills, an IQ of at least 250, and you need to be older than 25 in order to truly comprehend even the most basic aspects of NEKOPARA Vol. 1. Think about it. Every click, every movement, everything you do can potentially determine the outcome of the entire game. NEKOPARA Vol. 1  is a strategy game many times more complex than Chess. Playing NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is one of the most mentally exhausting things even for Albert Einstein, the secret creator of NEKOPARA Vol. 1.
the regret, my dyslexia bounced off the walls
I played this ironicly. not like i enjoyed this or anything.
Came for the "Plot", stayed for the /Plot/
I never really could get in to the Visual Novel genre despite trying on several occasions.  I played ones that were critically acclaimed and then I played Nekopara.  Though its debatable whether I would actually call this a "game", but to my surprise I found this to be rather fun.  I mean its stupid but its charming in its own way.  If you enjoy reading manga at all you can think of this as a visual comic, or depending on whether you install the adult patch, an H-manga.  Recommended though I wouldn't pay full price for it.  Wait for a sale with its 75% off if your interested.
Best game
Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai ♥♥♥♥♥ desuka? Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores.

It's ok i guess,, tho the game is a bit short,,
Chocola and Vanilla are good kitties.
God's wisdom is wasted on our kind.
Best game to play :'> Chocola and Vanilla are MINE
Got this as part of a Humble Bundle. It was.... Interesting. My wife got more into it than I did. I guess I played the censored version? *shrug*
Its so nice I very love this game Hope you guys can do more VOl,4 and 5 VERY INTERESTED
moar nyaa~
This game marks the peak of human evolution nothing can top NEKOPARA (except for more NEKOPARA) I have never been more moved or inspired in my life before surpasing all other forms of greatness Sky High, Sword art Online, and even Neo Yokio. I recomend this game to any other depressed weeb out there seconds away from hanging themselves.
Cinammon is best catgirl.  (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
oh baby
Never knew a game about fucking your cats could make me sad.  23 hours [b]very[/b] well spent.  10/10 Masterpiece.
Played with the patched version -- Wonderful game. Enjoyed every bit of it =)
Got to admit, I think the sexual content actively interferes with the novel. Steam's censored version is the version I played and thankfully skips past the actual adult scenes and is one of the only instances where I feel like it would have been an inferior experience, but even in Steam's version the implications of what happened doesn't feel quite right.  Fortunately, that's about the only notable issue for me. It's otherwise an enjoyable experience in seeing the relationship develop between Kashou and his unexpected catgirls Chocola and Vanilla, especially as the catgirls struggle to fully understand the way humanity works. Seeing the three earnestly try to pursue what they believe to be the best for them all while trying to understand the bonds they have was very nice.  Nekopara is not without its humour and the novel delivers well on this too. A lot of it ends up tying into the catgirl tendencies to slip into cat-like behaviour, and while I wouldn't say every joke worked it definitely hit the mark more plenty to make it worthwhile.  It was also great to see the E-mote system in use for the visuals. The last time I'd seen this was Tokyo School Life, and the implementation here is even better as they're able to give some illusion of talking, walking about or leaning to the side as a few examples. While it's not the norm for visual novels the impact is massive and I do wish it would become more commonplace.  There are no choices to make in the novel though, with a single linear storyline to the end.
Very emotional story i cried through the entire game! It had beautiful messages that most people wouldn't see and really good voice acting! One of the best games i've played tbh and cant wait to empty more of my cumm to the next vol.
Great Game with excellent story plot
Its preety cute
Best game catgirls for life 10/10 not fan of the lewd but the wholesome bits are the future

There are lots of KAWAII NEKO-GIRLS. That is enough reason to buy this VN  P/s: there is a 18+ patch, remember to download it my fellow otakus
my parents wanted me to be a doctor
[h1]Well, NEKOPARA vol.1[/h1] When first time I ran NEKOPARA, my mind was almost at my cuteness and kawaiiness limits :3 Those Nekos are amazing. Never seen such adorable and vivid kawaii characters before. I love all of them. They are completely adorable.  [h1]Characters[/h1] [olist] [*][url=https://youtu.be/yH4R0MwExvo][b]Azuki[/b][/url]. Aaah, my favorite one. She has me to crush on her with that frolic character and sarcastic enjoyable quips, always on a perky mischievous mood, more likely [i]tsundere[/i] character. Don't get me wrong and pls stop calling the cops - she's the eldest Minaduki neko! Also her responsibility and tender insides just makes me thrill. Guess I like her bluntness + shyness on the other side pretty much. She's a [i]Munchkin[/i] neko.  [*][url=https://youtu.be/ZmIqFqnMj60][b]Vanilla[/b][/url]. Well, she's also one of my favorites. With that corteous behaivor, cold and mysterious look in her eyes, sharp piercing phrases, calm and reserved barely recognizable emotions, rare soft and genuine tenderness - all that kindly teasing stuff makes [b]Vanilla[/b] truly catching one. Oh [b]Vanilla[/b]'s really makes my mind melt. She's more [i]kuudere[/i] than [i]dandere[/i] character to me.  [*][url=https://youtu.be/MWDFRIL7LoQ][b]Chocola[/b][/url]. [spoiler]Eheh, that's where the verge of crime becomes barely visible[/spoiler]. I like Chocola, her energetic mood always cheers me up, she's a really adorable one. A happy-go-lucky neko, I'm in love with her sincerity. Her innocent and genuine elated character, truly optimistic, sparkling eyes, exciting cute voice - all of it makes Chocola really really great. Truly, genki + moe char. [*][url=https://youtu.be/isJEI88_ZgI][b]Coconut[/b][/url]. Oh my, she's the best. She's quite different from the other nekos. Tall, athletic, smart, doing some martial arts. Even she's young, you can suppose like she's the elder one. Confident and cool, she's really modest and kindhearted from the inside. As she says about herself: [i]"...I think I'd rather be a cute catgirl than a cool one"[/i]. Also she's little bit shy, has some issues with low self-esteem and jelaous to other catgirls for their appearances. But for me, she's more than just good. She's gorgeous. Btw I really enjoy huge cute&clumsy shy girls too. She's a [i]Maine Coon[/i] neko [*][url=https://youtu.be/qVmrIZTE06U][b]Maple[/b][/url], kind, proud and also vigorous and extrovertous neko. She's quite a young lady. Sophisticated in some way. Well, trying to show that all the time - how be perfect and versatile. She's an [i]American Curl[/i] neko. [*][url=https://youtu.be/ccIkbzFxwjc][b]Cinnamon[/b][/url], kinda perverted Neko, maybe too much. Cinnamon makes me feel really awkward sometimes with her lewd and lecherous polysemantic phrases, but she's rather nice in her own special way. She's tender, even voluptuous character. [spoiler]Never liked overweighted melons though :D[/spoiler] So, I guess it's just a common moe character. She's a [i]Scottish Fold[/i] neko. [/olist]  [b]Kashou[/b]. Don't think that I might be able to say much about him, but, well, he's ambitious,  responsible, polite and most likely collective character, reasonable and collective in order to be compared to the player. Typical [i]"nice guy"[/i], he's the one the catgirls surely can rely on. [spoiler]Also, sometimes he's quite dumbass[/spoiler] To be honest, i like him anyway. I guess I should mention one more character, [url=https://youtu.be/WgJM99I_IAw][b]Shigure[/b][/url], [b]Kashou[/b]'s younger sister. To tell you the truth, she's not the person who can actually make you feel something more than common character interest. Not really catching. I guess the very plot needs her in order to be more logical and sense-making, to make whole story cohergent.   [h1]Graphics[/h1] [b][url=https://youtu.be/TQudvxDriz4?t=13m14s][quote=Noble, 2014]THE MOVE! THE MOVE! OH GOD! OH!! HOLY SHI~, THEY MOVE! THEY BLINK! OH GOD! OH MY GOD!

MY GOD, THEY F*CKING BOUNCE[/quote][/b][/url] My god, Noble's damn right, developers made them moving, using E-mote technology, and now the characters are no longer the static sprites or smth, they are quite active during the game process. That is surely the completely new level of a visual novel gams to me. Spectacular! [spoiler]THEY ACTUALLY BOUNCE! BOINGBOINGBOING[/spoiler] [spoiler]P is my favorite button now. Definetly.[/spoiler]  [h1]Voicing[/h1] Ah, the voices...mmm. In addition to E-mote technolgy of animation, each one of the characters, except protagonist, have their own voices! That is really niiiice! The actual seiyus done great piece of work! Well, that's really looks awesome, making them even more charismatic, catching and loveable. Because of highly developed anime voicing industry in Japan, all those characters are greatly sparkling and outstanding, I am really enjoying their different personalities. [spoiler]Aaand...in R-18 cutscenes the voice is actually doing about half of the work, ya know ;)[/spoiler]  [h1]Plot[/h1] Well you all should know the plot, it's simple and consistent, just th way it should be in such game. Well, I wish I could have had more influence to the game process like choices or smth, but whatever.  [quote=Wiki]Kashou Minaduki is an aspiring chef who moves away from home to open his own confection shop. While he is unpacking in his new shop, he discovers that two of his family's Nekos, Chocola and Vanilla, came along with him by hiding in cardboard boxes. After the two Nekos convince Kashou to let them stay and live with him, the three of them work together to run his shop, "La Soleil". Throughout the story, Kashou is frequently visited by his younger sister Shigure, as well as the other Nekos owned by his family.[/quote]  [h1]P.S.[/h1] [b][url=https://youtu.be/TQudvxDriz4?t=8m03s][quote=Noble, 2014]You know what?

Fun game, but I would recomend finding the 18+ patch online.
it's pure, unfiltered moecrap  not even good ironically tbh
Cute neko girls, great voice acting, non-static animation and catchy soundtrack--what else could you want? Save for the H-scenes which are not included, Nekopara is definitely worth your time. It's not complex, it's not deep, it's just straight up warm, fuzzy fluff and that's all a guy needs from time to time.  8/10
the first and the beginning of a new era between human and catgirls. buy  it, enjoy it, and then wish everything was real...
Just Like Nekopara vol 0 being a "Fan-based on Game" the original series of the brand "Nekopara" still gives a lot of mastu.... purposes i mean studying purposes... obviously "cough cough"  10/10 Game  I studied so hard so hard that my right hand "My Writing Hand" hurts so much "Studies". In this Process buy another nekopara game and resume your "Studies" :D
nice shit
the story was so moving and cant get enough of it
I will probably kill myself if it weren't for nekopara, i live by nekopara and forever will be its biggest fan.
Economists assume all humans act rationally. That is to say they act in terms of marginal benefits and marginal costs, and behave in their own self interest. Now, as an economist, do I think a rationally acting human would purchase this good? First we must determine the marginal costs and the marginal benefits  Costs: $9.99 More than 10 hours of your time Your social status Most of your friends Your chance of ever getting laid again  Benefits: Cute catgirl pseudoanimation "nade nade nade nade" (sound of headpats) You develop a new lust for catgirls and them alone You become a microbiologist to study CRISPR/Cas9 and perfect it to genetically engineer real life catgirls  As we can plainly see, any rational human being would purchase this game.
good game
Why are we still here… Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg, and my arm… and even my fingers… The body I’ve lost… and the comrades I’ve lost… It won’t stop hurting, like they’re all still there… You feel it too, don’t you?    catgirls kill only u can prevent severe addiction to farming hours on a game about animated cat girls
chest bounciness to the max
It's not the hentai it's the plot.
"Chocola... even remembers the flavour of master's semen"  This game is fun for the whole family. It has pet cats for the young children and it has very subtle sexual innuendo's for the older audience. Would definitely reccomend for a game night with the whole neighbourhood
A well crafted story driven video game, very emotional and very well developed. Its completly original and there are no cliches or just used them to make the story better, iwas amazed by this feature. The gameplay is completly revolutionary. I spend a whole saturday just to master and try to comprehend such a complex way to play a game, all of the other most difficult gameplay experiences you've ever had will be completly blown away by how HARD this game was for me. Finally trhe character development is so deep and complex I was amazed. It ponders deep questions about the human nature between fighting for their own nature and insticts against some of the socially accepted constructs. If I were a teacher i'd use this videogame as an electronic learning tool for students to depate about the concepts of ethics, moral and philosophy.  My mom saw me playing it and she said nothing, also she believed the voices were from my 10 year old cousins, so that's a plus. Finally  I'll keep playing this game for at least 100 hours before uninstalling, it's completly not boring at all.  Edit: After some 50 hours i just realized there is an automatic option to not leave the game, when you hit close it automatically points to NO. So i'm never leaving this precious game.,
9/10 needed more of it
I can't call this a game.
10/10 would fuck cats again
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.
I accidentally put a slight bit of pressure on my enter key, and I skipped a quarter of the game.       Story's good, art's good, game ran fine.      I couldn't do a McTwist though.

Came for the cat girls, stayed for the story. 10/10 would watch again.
Not my cup of tea.
There's a lot of Nyan Nyan, awfully cute. 11/10 IGN
Humanity has fought devastating wars which had trillions of dollars wasted. Many preach for peace, but the only way peace could be achived is if all the scientist of the world came together and genetically engeneered catgirls. Lets make it happen. Let us give our children a better world. Let us give them catgirls.
this good
First of all, Don't forget your R 18 Patch.  Second of all, GG (No other complex words required to review a game thats already so much evolved with waifu's or Nekofu's).  Third of all, Vol 2 > Buy.  Fourth of all, Have fun one more time.  Arigato ~
The tissues aren't for wiping away my tears.
My IQ probably dropped a couple points because I played this game.
yes yes
Not as good as Sonic and Knuckles.  11/10 Would play again
purrfect visual novel~
Going in for the ninth time one handed
10/10. Best First Person Shooter game. (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
fuck you.
i got really board near the end
If you like cats or catgirls, thhis is the game for you! A Cat is fine and one cat leads to another.
[h1]Liked[/h1] [list] [*] Really liked the animation and voice actors as it made this visual novel come alive.   [*] The art style is high quality and clearly a lot of care went into drawing the characters.  [*] The story was an emotional roller-coaster and to me at least was a lot darker then what is presented on the surface.  Considering most reviews are jokes I am not convinced those players get what is really going on in the universe the game creates.   [*] Sliders to adjust text speed.  Fast reader here and all text at once is an option. [*] Easy 100% achievements.  [/list] [h1]Disliked [/h1] [list] [*] I suppose my only complaint… where are the cat boys? I would not mind some Yaoi action. [/list] [h1]Other Thoughts[/h1] I prefer ecchi/softcore/tasteful erotica.  This steam version is just that, cuts what is literally porn and keeps all the good stuff. Would not recommend the patch or full version, it ruins the story if anything.
This certainly a game that is available for money.
One word, amazing
god is real and he made this game
catgirls are the solution to world peace
you can even play a “shooting” game
Imagine... A Nekopara world.. with TWO Coconuts.
its a amazing game but steam is being bad for doing stuff
I used to hate cats but now I like them a little more then before.
The same friend gifted me another addition to this stifling story.  It was supposed to be a great time, y'know; late at night, experiencing it with close friends, getting a few drinks down me. And just to seal the deal, a friend recommended me to download the 18+ mod hidden from Steam. So I thought, why not, right? I'm only going to play this once, so I may as well get the most out of it. And that's exactly what happened.  We got the most out of it, and us.  Nothing can prepare you for what you see from this. Nothing. You think you'd have some idea as to what might happen, but anything you imagine gets crushed through the floors of your nightmares by the haunting reality of NEKOPARA, Vol. 1. Through blood, sweat, tears and alcohol, I managed to escape and live to tell the tale. My friends, however, weren't so lucky. I dedicate this review to them and simultaneously pay my respects.  Remember folks, in the world of NEKOPARA, sharing is caring.  Sharing... is caring.  Until next year.  P.S. As always... press P for bounce. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
If you like neko or kawaii stuff in general you will love this!
My parents really hate me.
Kinetic Novel (no choices). Nice story about bonding and "romancing" with Chocola and Vanilla, your two Catgirls. Pet the catgirls and follow their story through the opening of your bakery. Regular genetically manufactured CATGIRLS, that are normal in that world. They can be kept as pets, companions or lovers. No catboys, that is genetically impossible, I presume. Nekopara has one on THE BEST art and animation in VNs or KNs that I have seen so far! Steam has the All Ages version (no nudity), R18 version available to buy on the publisher's homepage. Reeeeally cute and mostly heartwarming dialogues. Really stupid parts as well.  Follow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050
I love this hentai I mean game
Amazing Visual Novel with adorable characters. For anyone wanting to get into visual novels this is one I can recommend trying. Also a bit of content is censored, but you can buy the patch on Denpasoft and not missing out on too much without the patch.
Not that great. you have no effect on story and feels like im watching a random anime.
I am not a pedo!
Personally the story was awful and I only kept going because the girl were cute but even then it was still a drag. Then I heard that the steam version has no 18+ content which I wouldn't mind....if the story was worth while. I got a refund after 2 hours and I hope I can buy a better VN.
10/10 best story ever. better than twillight
This game toys with your emotions as you grow to love the two catgirls you'll be with during the novel and as a cat owner myself I fell in love with this as soon as the first chapter ended, also boob bounces so you got that as well
i cummed
Thanks humble bundle... i'm going to hell.
*Sexually grunts in Japanese*
why
+install 18 patch get uncut "plot" (lew face)  +wear phone  `enjoy~
Using for JLPT2 'Study' 超可愛い
Now, one may look at this game and think, "what sort of filthy anime shit is this, theres not even the premis of choice or plot why the fuck is steam recomending this to me" and you would be right, in fact i used to think similarly, but heres the thing, steam allways know what you want, even if it is a weeaboo game about nekos. before i played this game i would have told you that anime is garbage, and if you said neko i would have no idea what you meant, but now i play nekopara, and even run it in the backround so i can hear the music while i play other games.  The actual story is very good, suprisingly so for a choiceless visual  novel, and all of the charecters are rather unique and fun to watch. the downside is that for the nudity sections you need a patch. Overall i would give this game a 10/10  Its honestly life changing
Not going to lie, Fun and cute story but it sucks the nudity is steamed out..........
animal abuse 0/10
The best game ever (1)
Best Game. Gonna AFK ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's... ok.  5/10.
Catgirls. What else is there to say? If thats not enough to get you buying the game, if you're male you should evaluate your sexual preference, just sayin.         also theres a patch that lets you see all the sex scenes so it is worth 10/10 would fap again.
"I find myself surrounded by two impressionable animal slave children, what should I do?"  "I know, I'll stick my penis in them!"  Kashou Minaduki belongs in prison.
+Fun +Nice drawings +No hassle +Addicting Story  -Price(?) I bought it for half the price. I would [b]never[/b] buy it if it was full price, it's not worth the full price in my opinion. %50 discount and some Steam funds that you don't need laying around, you can buy it. Get's boring after a while since the concept is the same and all you need to do is click. It's really not a game, actually a visual novel. Not my type but still would recommend [u](for the discounted price)[/u]  EDIT: JUST FIGURED OUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FAP TO SHIT FAM NOW IT'S WORTH 1 BILLION $$$
nekos and paras
Nyaamazing. I Nyaaprove!
It is a  game which can relex yourself.
Vanilla add cream :) (if you know what i mean (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )
Nekopara is about a dude who ran away from home with two cats that are supposed to be "catgirls". The catgirls are just delusions of the protagonist, they're actually just plain cats.  [spoiler]...He f*cked both cats.[/spoiler] 10/10
Did it for the memes, now filled with regret, could've bought doom, want a refund dude.
Reviews of this game have been done to death. Might as well just tell anyone reading I got it from a humble bundle with some games I actually wanted a while back and "played" it for the trading cards. It's a terrible excuse for a single-route visual novel and an even worse one for a story in general. On the plus side, it has lovely visual work and I got some nice steam wallet money from selling the card drops.
Sehr gut. 10/10
Fun for the whole family
[b] NOTE: This review is made for the uncensored version, without uncensoring no H-scenes can actually be seen afaik.)[/b] [strike] [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370848130] Instructions for uncensoring here [/url] [/strike] My experience with Nekopara Vol1 was amazing! i really loved the theme and artwork. This visual novel is not really a game in any sense of the word, it has zero interactivity except for *ahem* a certain button that makes a certain thing bounce by which i mean [spoiler] cats [/spoiler] and thus does not have multiple endings or branching, which most visual novels do have. You have to be [strike] a fitlhy weeb [/strike] a fan of Manga style art or anime to get the best out of this game, if you dont then you may or may not get the point of this "game" [b] Pros: [/b] - Awesome artwork - Good voice acting - A sweet love story - Well-written - Eroge to the max (lot of h-scenes, probably uncensored only) [b] In-betweens: [/b] - Japanese voice acting ( which i loved) - Settings are pretty basic (not a con, since this is very normal and understandable for visual novels) - No interaction - Very easy to get 100% achievements on - Absolute singleplayer - you will want to play this when you really are all alone. - requires tissues, socks or towels to play, will crash-to-desktop without them [b] Cons: [/b] - On the short side (my play time being calmly reading and getting trough the whole story) - side-characters have little to no development (but, it seems the developers are going the route of making new volumes focusing on the other side characters, with Vol. 2 having 2 of the side characters in the spot light as what i assume are main characters) -  [strike] not actually a con [/strike] [spoiler] DEAR GOD I JUST FAPPED TO 2 FUCKING CATS, SEND HELP  [/spoiler]  All in all a good game for you [strike] to play with your daughter to show her why her cat had kittens [/strike] to play with when you want to play with yourself. I would honestly rate it 8/10
9/10 Great
Dad is doubting that I'm gay after masturbating to cat girls
Solid replay value
Got em some thicc anime puss. Sad that you have to pay for the uncensor patch.
10/10 Catgirls FTW
My parents have never been so proud of me.
hmmm i will rate this a yes
I skipped everything except for the really important things
i'm only writing this review so this game shows up in my friend's reccomended feed
Why did it have to be censored
10/10 would disappoint parents again
OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE Vol.1
Make sure to buy the extra $10 "dlc" for extra "plot".  Congrats on discovering a new fetish.
Nekopara is the best game I have ever played with one hand!
NEKOPARA Vol.1 looks like it fits 100% into an outsider’s view of visual novels; a dull, fandom-focused story with pretty girls who do nothing but dote on you. Yes, these catgirls are pretty devoted, but there’s more going on than a simple harem storyline. One can’t help but be intrigued by Kashou’s devotion to baking, understanding both catgirls, and wanting to see everything turn out well. With that said, some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up. Others might be mad knowing they’ve missed out on some scenes due to Steam’s restrictions on adult content. Still, NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.
August 26th 1964, The Xin Wu dynasty.  In ancient India a great German windmill engineer came to offer his help in exchange for chocolate chip biscuit cookies, The ones wich where loved by many British farmers far in the south west.   As it stands the Federal line of Russian Democratic Countries has combined its forces to sexual harras the people of Turkey, Ofcourse the Communist state of global economic replublicans wasn't all too happy about this, so they sended out the People's Army of United China to fight these space monkeys wich led to an all out war of diplomatic aggresion against Africa, And thus nuclear winter begun.  You are given full control over Alkeb Mussin he's an european communist party advisor of the great Mexican wall production industry, As the player you're tasked with some pretty lame stuff "To make this city of united space rats run like crisps of baked cow oil." it's like a dream come true. This particular story features some amazing moments such as the one time you flew a Tu-144 into United Austrian Space Territory and Generic Black Male had to come and save you... Well that's about it, I guess.  More filler, Potato baking competition of united global potato states funded by the African Aqua Powerd Car Fuel ..eh Company yes that's it. After you fixed all the economic space whale problems the game ends with a big screw you and tells you to go and play the second game.   So yeah it sucks donkey dong.
the reason to live
This is probably the most wholesome game on Steam, and I'm not even being ironic.
Truly a 10/10 experience.   I would say that this game could easily be one of next biggest speedrunning titles in the community, there's some extremely high skill strategies that can be employed throughout this game which leads to an extremely challenging and frame-perfect run that could be improved upon for decades.   It also gives extremely satisfying... Entertainment.. For the viewer of the speedrun.  Certainly child-friendly, and would expect to see on the next SGDQ.   On a serious note, it's basically just an 18+ manga which has been animated slightly with if I do remember correctly.. A boob jiggle amount bar.
Purchase it and can't stop it. Tell me I am not the only one. WORTH.
It's cute and ecchi, just as intended. I'm surprised there's incest (which I'm indifferent about) and polyamory (which I'm glad about) though. Didn't expect that.   Although, I am glad that I didn't play the 18+ version. At least with this version, I could imagine nice, sweet, affectionate sex happening between the characters, instead of the gross CGs that are actually in the 18+ version. Fyi, probably about 99% of women don't actually like being covered in j*zz. Ew. Talk about being made for the cishet male gaze. I mean, I could've handled one scene like that (and ignored it), but literally all of them involve the catgirls being covered in j*zz (or cream that looks like j*zz). Like, seriously, have the developers ever heard of variety?   Since this is the all ages version, that's the only reason it isn't getting a negative review. I recommend getting it in a bundle or for free if possible. I try not to pay for ecchi or hentai anyway.
I fapped too much...  TOOO MUCH!!!!  11/10 Still fapping
Its already half away till 2K18 yet no scientist make any of these cute cat girls...  Why the fuck you goverments pays money for nuke the whole world when you can have a cute girl running around on your backyard?!
Vol. 1 possesses a much longer storyline and richer character development (focusing on Chocola & Vanilla) as compared to its predecessor, Vol. 0, which was more of an introductory VN than it being an actual story plot. The artwork doesn't seem to have changed much so it's still as good as before and the user-friendly UI remains untouched.  Also, unlike Vol. 0, this one has juicy parts but you'll need to buy the DLC from elsewhere first. ;)
It's Pawsitively Purrfect.
nice neko VN with a niceass story...  more great with R-18+ patch (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
I got this game in a humblebundle and then decided to also grab the H patch because I don't want to go half cocked into something, I go full cocked. The main character also decided to go full cocked into something, if you catch my drift. It started out as kind of... cute story that was even a little sad, but it got hardcore pretty quick. There was a shower scene pretty early, but I was like "Eh, that's not too bad. It's just boobs." It got way, WAY more hardcore later. It's still a little censored by pixelation, but there is some straight up sex in this game. Also the sex sounds they have sound like someone stepping on mashed potatoes over and over again. 11/10 easy to control with one hand.
Wish I never spent money on this, just learned I can find free porn.
Nekopra is a well told dystopian story about a race of genetically engineered slaves, cleverly told from the point of view of the slave owners. With near human intelligence and an apparent need for sex to stay healthy, the "catgirls" are used for sex, companionship and free/cheap labor. Is their affection towards the protagonist and his family authentic or simply an act to aviod the greater horror of being an un-owned catgirl; hunted by the authorities and forced to live as fugitives?
不错，我喜欢
veri gud game 11/10
I would like to remind everyone that technically speaking, these cats girls age the same as "regular cats". Just a thought.
10/10. Greatest game. *Don't press P*
Two weeks ago I was like "What the actual f**k am I watching!?" when I first discovered the game on YouTube... But I decided to give it a real shot and when Chocola & Vanilla came out of those boxes... I had no choice but to surrender and beg for mercy. Talk about a roundhouse kick in the face of adorableness, I´m in pain everytime I play and I like it ;P  This game made me hate reality. This game gave me a bad fetish for catgirls. This game made me jealous as f**k of Kashou. It´s both mentaly exhausting and energetic to play. I hate this game as much as I love it for what it did to me xD  10/10.
Its just story and not actually a game. Goodd cute story but just as an fyi its not interactive.
Just buy this game and enjoy the cuteness.
Everyday we stray further away from god...
great game best commies
Well, it's a interesting AVG with NekoMusume and their Master's life in La Soleil ( French, which means sun if you pay attention to their dialogue ) Western Dessert Cafeteria. Without any porn patch, it looks like an average AVG anything you can find in Japan. Perhaps it is one of the first totally Japanese AVGs on Steam, and it looks much cute compared with Sakura Series, all of this factor make it success when it come out from Greenlight.   Generally, it is a good time-killer if you feel bored to play other competitive game
I said to stop gifting me these and I woke up to another one
Chocola is the best That personally and hair YES! I love vanilla too! Buy this game; you'll drool
When I decided to buy this I immidiately knew it'll be the best purchase of my life. I never had any friends to begin with so it didn't hurt at all. Well who doesn't love a game with "Chest bounciness" option.
what the fuck
this totally doesnt make me wanna rape my cats. great game naice m8
Just so you know, this is the censored version on steam. If u want an uncensored version, go here: http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE144678.html Why am i asking. Of course u want the uncensored version 10/10
good shit
СИГУРЭ - ЭТО СИГУРЭ А ХОЗЯН - ЭТО ХОЗЯИН (С) Чокола И ЕЩЕ МНОЖЕСТВО ФРАЗ ЧОКОЛЫ В Nekopara
Parents were even more disappointed. Would buy again.
The option to max out the boob bounce instantly made this a 10/10.
^w^ kawaii cute game, I love it! <3
Fun and highly entertaining. I would definitely recommend this game if you like adorable catgirls! Meow~

Really gooooooooooooooood AND BEST with the  R-18 patch ^^
None the less, it's a good game for $10... But since they took out all of the lewd scenes I don't think it's worth it. The steam page says nudity but there isn't any, they take it all out. But, with Huniepop they keep in when you take them home for their last dates but we don't get anything like that in Nekopara... Made me kinda sad because getting the 18+ patch version is a lot of work if you have a laptop because it automatically blocks it due to everything being cencored now a days. So if you are thinking of buying this game for the nude scenes, you will sadly be dissapointed due to them not even being in the game in the first place. Quite sad but would still recommend the game in the end if you love cute catgirls. :D
Forgive me god for i have sinned
so frekn kawaii ugh why cant i have a catgirl thank u 4 this gift from the neko heavens
a game where you fuck cats. 10/10

As far as I have noticed, this is the best visual novel out there. High quality drawings, decently animated, and enjoyable story with solid writing, nice music, etc. This is a great first visual novel if you've never played one before, it's leaps and bounds beyond others. I would recommend installing an R18+ patch for the full experience though. This steam version has a lot of censorship that takes away from what you're likely expecting.
这款游戏我很负责的告诉你是和谐版 粉丝和支持作者的推荐入手 要是你就为了看看自己考虑清楚
NICE
Played a little bit, pretty good game
Good Game Eggs Dee
This visual novel has adorable characters, beautiful art, and a nice story that leaves you wanting more. While the lack of choices makes this seem more like watching a show than playing a game, the outstanding animation and heartwarming dialogue really brings the characters and story to life.  I would recommend getting this game, however due to the lack of actual gameplay I would suggest getting it from a sale or as part of a bundle.
Plz explain why I always find myself playing this game way more than I should.
Its meant to be a light hearted storybook about Catgirls/Neko and their human Owners/Masters. In this storys' setting, Catgirls are bio-engineered cats to have humanoid bodies and mostly human Intellegence. Think of all the other things the Japan has made into cute humanoids. Computers, cars, tanks, food, you name it its out there somewhere.   This VN has had some light hearted shenanigans. But parts of it really tug your heart strings.   I've known about Nekopara for over a Decade it seems.  Before Steam was big, it was sold as a top tier game from Japan on J-list. Surely it didn't have the censorship this one has.   I'd recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sweet story, or are Cat lovers themselves. I'm sure you'll like the scene where he is looking for a book to learn about taking care of Catgirls.
A masterpiece of modern age.

what is this prompty refunded afterwards
Sequel to the first one, still amazing.
Nekopara is good stuff  Pros:  - Good Voice Acting  - Great story line - Quite Funny - Some NSFW stuff  - Catgirls (why not) - BGM matches each part of the game - Get to pat them catgirls  - Adjust how the boobs shake hehehe (set to max for max bounciness)  - Amazing art especially for CGs   Cons - Some more intense NSFW stuff requires to pay more and is not in steam too (sad😢) - There is bug in the achievement for playing in different languages  - Was hopping to be able to make some choices in the game  Ahhh screw this review just buy the game for the catgirls! Isnt that why your here?
I am not a fan of catgirls, yet I enjoyed this relatively short VN.  The most prominent feature would be its highly animated characters, which is definitely a fresh experience as compared to other VNs. Just by having animated facial expressions and movements, the characters felt more lively.  As for the story, well, you can say that it is definitely lacking in content. But let's be real, I'm sure no one buys this just for the story  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  After all, plot > story.  Just relax and enjoy it
Cat girls and cake. I'm basically in heaven ok
Cat Girls                                   - Check Harem                                      - Check Good Stories                            - Check Unique Character Design        - Check Unique Character Personality - Check Unique Character Back Story  - Check Enjoyable Song                        - Check Good Animation                      - Check Indie Game                              - Check Flat Chest                                 - Check Boobies                                    - Check Kawaii Imotou                          - Check Cute                                         - Check R-18 Patch                               - Check  This game rocks! note: this game is enjoyable if you like the girls cuteness, if you aim for the R-18 content.... (you can download the patch elswhere)... in my opinion is a so-so. Dont get mad, this game is about cute cat girls enjoying their dialy life not Sex salve you perv!
This game had me genuinly looking thrrough the bible for help  :/
Catgirls. Need i say more?
Theirs a chest bounciness scale in options
Not bad for a visual novel. Didnt know about the R-18 patch you can buy for it till i finished the game.  Eh still a nice game for slow days... now to figure out what it means by play in English when it was in english..
i truthfully didnt know that there was more to the game and half was cut out but i bought it for the adorable cats
first of all the game is super cute, story was great (and a little sad) I recommend to anybody who likes anime cute cat girls and a good story
DISSAPOINTMENT.  THOGUHT IT WOULD SOME INTERACTIVE SHIT, DECISION MAKING AND SHIT  NOPE. NONE. JUST A CLICK CLICK CLICK AND LISTEN TO HALF BAKED VA'S  BASICALLY A LOW BUDGET ANIME.
Let's be honest. Nobody bought this game for it's "cute story" or "cute animations". I bought the game because I saw the tags "sexual content" and "nudity". Yet I have sat through about 10 hours of cringey-ass japanese meowing, in the hopes of the game living even remotely up to it's tags.   If you don't mind paying for ½ a game with a cringy story, and cringy characters, which there are 1000's of better iterations off, then feel free to fill Valve's piggybank. But if you are buying the game for it's sexual content, then don't buy it on steam. You will likely only end up dissapointed like I did.
people may seem joke around about the game (because you know 18+ game)  and i get where they coming from, but it's more then that  the visual novel focus on your character and his relationship with his cat girls (i know, that's why it's called nekopara) and how you and the cat girls go trough some daily activities, is like living and work with someone you actually love and care and overall is great if you really into love-friendship story and abit of joke (honestly some joke i don't get it)  the story have it's own flaw (but nothing is perfect by the way) the dialogue may seems a bit ridiculous (especially you chocola) but that's because she play the role of "innocent girl" is like she is too pure for this world   funny thing that i found out, that some people critizie you for having this game have because it has 18+ moment and we should be ashamed if we buy it, and some people confuse why there is no NSFW part  the steam version is the censord version, the only 18+ you'll find in this game are kissing the girl (at some place i know kissing is 18+), and the word "you are really good in bed", i know you can patch the 18+ but that's not the point  also dude, kashou the moment when you say "it's like my own daughter" to the catgirls, wtf man...
Nekos are always good.
I was tricked into buying this game. I can't play it any longer, i didn't know the nature of this game until I played it for a few minutes. Then i got the idea and closed the game before my mum see me playing this kind of thing. maybe carmelo anthony is into this game. he';s like that irl i dont see why he wouldnt enjoy this kind off court activity.
P-Mashing Simulator, SeemsGood
PROSTO GODNO, RUKA USTALA
it was pretty decent
Hands down The Best game on steam ever(For all nekopara games volumes not just this one), If the JOJO games(From HFTF, ASB, to EOH) were on the PC this would be the second best.
One of the best purchase in my life.  It features virtual reality that you may enjoy yourself and feel the presence of cat slaves.  But you'll realize how sad you are when you see the reflection of yourself on the loading screen holding your Weiner with tissues in the other hand.
I wouldn't dare defile my cat girls...              Damn me for being a horny virgin!
download game found the girl with cat ear Press P  10/10 I like it
To be honest, I really didn't enjoy these VN's at all. The writing was very cliche, the characters are annoying, and there is no choice at all. It's like I'm watching an ecchi (I understand that the steam release has all the hentai removed) anime. There is no interaction.   But aside from that I did find the interesting way that the characters were animated in scenes to be pretty cool. Just turn down the "boob jiggle" because it's really freaking annoying. Overall Nekopara 0-2 are "okay" at best. They are not something for me, but I decided to make the best of it and put a "recommend" because this game made me feel like a piece of shit for playing it and I don't want to feel like a piece of shit all alone.
how do i delete a game from my steam profile
This visual novel is cute :)
I feel like I got scammed by only getting half the game. When I bought this, nowhere did it say that the NSFW part was not included. Steam even rates it as "Sexual content" and "Nudity", but these were nowhere to be seen. The game is cute, but let's be honest, most people wanted the bestiality included. If you release future Nekopara games (or any other game series), please include that you only get half the game (or that you need to pay more for the full version.)
ERASE ALL WEEBS
So having completed Volume 1, I have to say that this game was surprisingly entertaining.  I picked it up in a bundle deal and I just thought I'd give it a spin to see what it's like.  The character art is certainly NEKOPARA's strong point, the character desings are well done and having them have an animated aspect really put it a cut above the visual novels out there with static graphics.  Chocola and Vanilla are able to emote and thanks to the stellar art it really helps drive home the emotions of the script.  And as someone who worked in the culinary industry I could relate to the struggle the MC was dealing with; which is always a plus.  The only downside is that this game is that you're locked in to one route, so you better enjoy the ride. I suspect that since there are other volumes of the game out there, they might focus more on the other characters introduced in Volume 1.  Though there is one character that I hope they don't, just to avoid dealing with certain taboos.  This game is at it's best when it's light hearted and silly.  So in conclusion; give NEKOPARA a shot.  The art, combined with the animation and voice acting make for a potent combo.
I loved this game so much! Vanilla and Chocola are the cutest things on earth, I love them. I think this game is worth the price and is a great deal during the steam sale!
Nice story and very polished graphic ;)
I can explain.
10/10 Would neko the para again.  I only play for the plot and nothing else. Ive truly trancended after playing this and  now respect Neko wamen even more.
All pain, no gain.
Wow Amazing Its a Game >_<
A penis joke and a gurren laggan reference in the same sentence 10/10
The writing is poorly done, the characters do not grow or change in logical/"good" ways, while the graphics are beautiful in color and shape the physics are poorly done, it would take significant changes to the plot and character traits as well as an overhaul of the game mechanics to make me even consider buying the next installment.
I. WANT. MY. MANLINESS. BACK.
I lost faith in myself  EDIT: Now seriously i feel like s**t.
Well.....what can i say? [spoiler] Nyaa~~ [/spoiler]

"A voiced picture book with jiggle physics". -Me, trying to expain the concept of visual novels to a non-weeb friend.
buying this game For Academic Purpose only ( ͡ ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ ͡°)  stop questioning me please           i hate my life...
i like cats boobs
cat
A very interesting game with a fun plot that also has amazing music. If only steam didn't remove the PG-18 content, then it would have been better.
It's aight.
Good light-hearted game that most fans of anime and especially catgirls will enjoy. Make sure to get the 18+ patch though!
Before playing the game: "Hmmm good reviews, good ratings, I should try this one" (I played many visual novels but not rated 18+)  After playing the game: *Goes to Church "Father, forgive me for I have sinned, I confess that I became a huge dissapointment"  10/10 would ruin my dream to became a priest someday
Cat girls I like. Like you cat girls too? Then buy the game you must.  There really isn't any other reason to buy the game... although that is a good enough reason in itself.
good game
11/10
great gameplay

Ah... NEKOPARA, where does one start?  The writing is suprisingly decent. The art and sound design are great. And, the use of the E-mote system brings a nice touch that really lifts it up.  Of course, there really is only one reason for a person to be playing, NEKOPARA, and that's fine. Because for relaxing, there's nothing better than tropsing around La Soleil with your trust Catgirls, is there?    P.S. Vanilla will always be best (cat)girl
A cat is fine to.
Rate 9/11 must buy
I got it as a gift after a changing my avatar.  I suppose to write something about this game, I think tag "Horror" and "Dating Sim" is the right choice
I think I'm on a list now.  100% worth.
Pretty good. Get the Patch? Its a masterpiece.
The bbob jiggling mechanics are way ahead of its time, a revolutoanry game that everyone should try
it is very good
Good game and good meme
Great game for Adult Graphic Novel fans. But it's for specific fans, because the heroines are really childish. I don't like it very much, even being a genre fan. I recommend it, just it's not my style of AGN.
Lord forgive me, for I have sinned, and had a damn good time doing it.
Divine
This is true art.  Pro's -Cute cat girls. -Sweet story. -R18 Patch. -Plot  Con's -I hate myself now. -Don't have the R18 Patch. -If my family finds out they will burn my laptop. -Finished it in > 6 hours.  Would recommend if your a weeb or furry.
这游戏，会让你索然无味的？？？！！
Lovely neko pls play them hard
People died to give us the freedom to play games like this. I guess. So. OOOOOOHHH IS THAT A TWINKIE OVER THERE (walks away)
This is, without a doubt, the greatest video game I've ever played.
[list] [*]cute anime waifus [*]nekos [*]nsfw scenes [*]really great art  [/list] 10/10
My dad disowned me for playing this game.
My parents used to be proud of me, and now they just cant see me...................
Do I find this creepy? Well... on the one hand, the restaurant owner isn't paying the girls, and also thinks of them as family members, daughters and even actual cats at times, and yet has sex with them. On the other hand, the girls are working voluntarily and are perfectly well looked after, and they also repeatedly request the sex and also perfectly understand what sex is.  Meh, I'm not paying up for the 18-rated version of the game anyway, not after only getting this at a large discount and only because it contains other things I really love: flamboyant outfits, pretentious cake shops, cake, cats, pretty manga art and nice music.  I'd recommend buying it but not paying full price for it and definitely not paying extra for things that the game's dialogue still doesn't exactly hide is happening, and that you can have more fun imagining for yourself :p
totally worth getting arrested for :')
Not a game. Not worth the money. Watch a let's play if you're into this kind of thing.

A truly distopian world wrapped in a kusoge shell.  [spoiler] Some time in the recent past, scientists have created a successful human-cat hybrid creature, all of which are female.  Their growth patterns are bizarre, combining "cat years" and human physiological growth to develop an adult at a mere one to two years of life.  As a side effect of the hybridization, they are born infertile.  As the hybrids grow in popularity, Japan's legal system develops a crude set of regulations to keep the new pseudospecies in check.  Catgirls, as they are informally regarded, must have legal documentation on hand at all times, or they may be arrested and detained.  They must be owned by a documented citizen, and may only be employed by express concent of their owner. [/spoiler]  All of this is explicitly detailed in the roughly two to three hours of text composing NekoPara Vol. 1.  There are no choices to be made, little player interaction, and basically no replay value. It's a technologically sound, high quality Visual Novel, with perhaps the strangest, most thought-out plot for getting cat ears on french maids even written.  Regardless of whether you download the 18+ patch for explicit nudity, and this truly is a plot spoiler, [spoiler] you unambiguously mate with both cats. [/spoiler]  It's not for me.  But it delivers moderately on every promise it makes.
I don't know if i should be playing this.
Fucked some cat girls maxed volume got the DLC told my parents I fuck cat girls and spammed it to all my friends thank you for making me lose everyone that ever loved me I was too busy laughing to get a good wank out of it though so it feels bad man.
My friend got me this for my birthday.     No idea why.     Help me.
this is the cure of deppresion
Nekos, do i need to say anymore.
Hentai
At 4 and a half hours worth of content, Nekopara Vol 1 doesn't have a ton to offer. The plot is a slice of life about opening a bakery and living with nekos that will either work for you because you wanna bone one of the characters or not work because it is, penultimately, boring. The writing isn't particularly good but the voice work is cute, the translation is one of the better VN productions I've seen in a while as well. The art is fantastic, I've been a fan of Sayori for a number of years so you won't be let down. Pretty much if you buy this, you know what you're buying it for and will enjoy the cuteness of it and the shallow self-insert fantasy. But if you're looking for a decent plot to complement your "plot" I'd check elsewhere.   But overall, it's a fun VN. I'd purchase it on sale though, the price tag is a little steep for the minimal content you get.
It was a gift I swear.
Where can I start? This game follows a Male Protagonist, Kashou, as he tries to stand on his two feet in society by starting his own cafe. Kashou discovers that two of his family's cats, Chocola and Vanilla, has followed him and allows them to stay by helping out with the new store.  Nekopara is slightly different compared to VNs of the past where sprites are not used. Instead the game relys on "E-mote" system where characters are brought to life.   This game has a very light hearted tone and vague storyline. Everything is done over the top like most VNs in Japan. There really isn't anything majorly wrong with the game per say, but I could imagine people not enjoying cat servicing.  I really enjoyed playing this w/o the 18+ DLC as it keeps it very light hearted. I do wish however, rather than skipping the 18+ scenes and placing the story just after the deed it done, the story should be skipped directly to the next chapter.  For the price of the game, it's definitely worth buying even without the 18+ DLC.
My arm has never been more tired.
You can play it using one hand : )
REALLY ? Is cat girl really exist in this world , i mean yeah they do in Japan , LOL ?
I'm a simple man, I see cute Nekos and a game that is 18+ count me in on some great arm excercise.
what the f***
Simple game which is good for singles like me. Just install a R-18 patch and play for yourself.
Waste of money, unless you are a dirty weeaboo.
444 NEKO take my soul
I expected this to be a mindless, plotless bit of cute fluff and lewdness that I could tab over to during downtime in other games.  Instead, I plumbed the depths of human depravity in an unintentional horror story about an eerie world in which people are chattel, either abandoned to die hopeless and alone or treated as a mix of animal and idiot child unless their owners feel like fucking them. The developers of Nekopara needed to tackle the question of how their faceless, voiceless player self-insert vehicle would come to live in a cramped apartment with a bevy of amorous catgirls.   They had many options. They chose, apparently totally blind to the implications, the option in which humanity uplifts another terrestrial species to human levels of intelligence, but then elects to keep them as pets/slaves/sex toys, maintaining a system of psychological degradation and police-enforced dependence in order to keep them docile and reliant on their masters.  And nobody comments on this intensely unethical behavior--in fact, it is so normal that people publically praise individuals who chose to maintain sexual relations with sophonts who are a) their property, b) in an extremely submissive relationship (in terms of power dynamics), c) viewed as nonhuman animals or children by most of the population.  That's purely the worldbuilding. I could comment on the fetishization of mating seasons or the usual pseudo-incestuous relationships, but frankly none of that could top the entirely unintentional creepiness of the worldbuilding which makes the plot possible.  Of course this probably came about because they used 90% of the budget animating sex scenes and boob jiggle, leaving their writers to subsist on the packaging from the instant noodles the rest of the team ate. Long-term dehydration and malnourishment probably doesn't help the creative process.  "9/10, needs more mosaic censoring." -IGN
-without patch- 1/10 reported no H-content  -with patch- overall inf/10 such gameplay, much physiscs, much cuteness, and other stuff iykwim
The story is on the lower side of mediocre, but I am still inclinded to recommend the game, based on the impressive visuals, good configuration options and the fact it's fully voice acted.
A cute fluffy story about Kashou's relationship with Chocola and Vanilla that was very enjoyable to watch. The artwork of the background imagery and the catgirls was very beautiful also.  (To mention also, I played the SFW version, not the 18+ one)
Meh
This game is great. Need more nudes. Duration 4/5 Hour    ~ARMO was here
This is my life now, day after day i stray further away from god.
NO I don't  recommend  NEKOPARA any of them . I Got volume 0 1 2 in a bundle. The story is so Boring . The characters are all Idiots. The  story is your some schmuck who moved out to start a barkery . While your little sister and a bunch of cat girls try to seduce you . All while fighting over you like your the last penis to be found.Then whinning at you that your a pervert for giving in to their advances . While feeling  like a crap about yourself for doing so . If you want bounceing breast play DEAD OR ALIVE 5 CORE FIGHTERS THAT'S FREE. For actuall breast and nuditiy if your an adult there are way better more entertaining venues. Also if your looking for game play / choices there is none .It is what it says it is a visual novel not a good one either.
The best game.
Mostly this game is good. But. Food Stand Cat is not a main character, despite being undeniaby the best waifu. 0/10
Just Do it.
It’s truly a dark day for humanity when a man has to pay money for game with promised nudity and feline fellatio only to find out that all of the nudity and pus*y pus*ies are behind another $10 paywall. It is an insult to my very sense of perversion that Steam and Nekopara think they can take advantage of my gruesome desperation with false labels and promises only to give me the ol’ masterbait and switch. Here I am wasting my time downloading a game, listening to “~nya~” every two seconds, about to tear my hair out only to find out that the game I downloaded, the game I purchased for the sole reason of committing digital bestiality, is actually a hollow shell of what I was promised. I don’t even want my money back, Valve. You can keep your filthy money, at least one of us gets to get off that way. I have to type this review with one hand since the other is icing my blue balls. All I wanted to do was take a calm evening after a long day of work and f**k some cats. Is that too much to ask!? I don’t think so. I’m a humble man, a man of God. I don’t think I was asking for too much here. I just wanted to give my kittens some milk and cream, but instead I sit here left yearning for the fap that might have been, the spank I’ll never yank, the banana I’ll never buff, the guerrilla I’ll never shave. You broke me as a man Valve, I once was a normal functioning member of this society and now you made me into this.
This game has taught me how to spam ALT-TAB really fast whenever I hear foorsteps.
nice game
nekopara vol come with cute vanila and chocolate <3
i play this game for the plot
:3  CATGIRLS
The number of friends in my friend list dropped faster than my pants
YOU LIKE NEKOS! I LOVE NEKOS! 10/10
Money well spent
God has left me
i got this off humble and it gave me cancer
Awesome Visual Novel. Totally Worth It!!!
Bought this for the cat puns... got what I wanted.... and more.... F***
I went into this game expecting a more 'choose your endding' type game.  I got upset the further i went in with no options, no questions for me to pick. So i had to look up endings and found it was a true visual novel.  Once i accepted that i was 'just reading a book' i really got into the game. The chars are well played out and balence nicely.  Of corse this game being on steam takes out a bulk of the....ahem..... action.  I assume i would have enjoyed this game more if it was the full game rather than the major tease it was.
wanna watch a lewd film with cats? go for this one
Just Here For The Trading Cards Hombre
and this pack completes my life.... i'm ready for neko paradise....
Got this as part of the Humble Bundle, got all achievements in less than 30 minutes... Zero choices in this game, tired of these VN's with no path choices/flags or any content worth my time...
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
To summarize my list; i would give this game a 6.5-7/10 because  as a person who wouldve rather sayori pump out more color doujins over this, black and white doujins, and an OVA that is practically this game, this series (as a visual novel) made the doujin die. I gave this game a yes because of my luck with the trading cards. 4 chocolas. Life complete.  Pros: Waifus Adult/18+ patch Easy achievements Decent story (In my opinion it isn't GREAT but it also isn't bad, espcially when compared to the doujin story)  Cons: No caramel (props if you know who I mean.) Overpriced hent (if you obtained the patch LEGALLY) Killed the doujin Short when compared to other VN's of the same price
hey it's the sin game
MY DREAMS COME TRUE!!!!!!

I cant stop fucking my cats
[h1]OVERVIEW[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 is the second in the Nekopara series of anime visual novels from developer NEKO WORKs, published by Sekai Project. It was actually the first game released, but now has a fan-made prequel: Volume 0.  Nekopara Volume 1 introduces Kashou, a young man who has vacated the family home and moved into an apartment above his new bakery, Patisserie La Soleil. The game hints at various previous happenings in the family that have led Kashou to move out and attempt to start his adult life again on his own. While moving in, Kashou discovers that two large and unfamiliar boxes have been left in the bakery by the movers. When he opens them, he finds Chocola and Vanilla, the two youngest catgirls in the Minaduki family, waiting inside.  If you're not familiar with Nekopara lore already, catgirls are genetically modified human female / cat hybrids, who are partly treated as pets and partly as valuable family members. They are human-sized and with mostly human looks, but with ears, tails, and very feline personality traits. The Minaduki family's youngest member, Kashou's sister, Shigure, owns six of them, all with very distinct personalities: Vanilla, Chocola, Cinnamon, Coconut, Maple, and Azuki  For various reasons, not the least of them being emotional blackmail, Kashou ends up keeping the two catgirls around to help with setting up the bakery, and chooses to hire them as the shop's poster catgirls when La Soleil opens. He soon finds that to be legally employed or to travel around by themselves, the catgirls must pass a test and carry a bell-collar license with them at all times.  Volume 1 focuses on Kashou, Chocola, and Vanilla, in their efforts to open and run the bakery while also learning to live together.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] Graphics are extremely similar to Volume 0, with beautiful paper-doll cut outs and animated models of the catgirls over slightly blurry digitally painted backgrounds. As with Volume 0, animations are much more detailed and frequent than in any other visual novel series that I've seen.  The game has some different drawing styles in parts, including 'chibi' art.   [h1]Sound[/h1] As with Volume 0, both title and in-game music fall into the typical anime theme-song style, with upbeat electronic instruments and an elevator-music feel. The music is well produced and inoffensive, but not the sort of thing I'd listen to while on a long drive.  Sound effects are good, but few and far between, being used to punctuate the music and speech at appropriate places in the story.  All characters except the protagonist, Kashou, are fully voiced. Though I don't understand Japanese well, they seem quite professional to me and suit the personalities well. Sounds and voices are normalised well.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 plays like a traditional visual novel, with no player choices and thus only one available ending. The norm in the genre is to promote replayability through multiple available choices and multiple endings, so it seems a little bit of a letdown to have only a completely linear path with no real interaction available.  The game engine appears to be exactly the same one that is used in Volume 0, with features such as autoplay, skipping, backlog, multiple languages, animations, and the all-important chest bounciness. There are no real interaction points on the screen; all you do is click to advance to the next line of dialogue or the next scene where appropriate.  Though the game has the sexual content and nudity tags on its Steam store page, without the official adult patch it's actually very tame for an anime-themed visual novel. There's a mildly raunchy still shot of a shower scene, with censored nudity, and sex scenes, which are implied or talked about, but not actually shown. The patch is prohibitively expensive -- often more than the game itself -- so I wasn't able to review the adult version of the game.  The story is fairly typical of a manga, anime, or visual novel plot, with no real twists or surprises. It's mostly light hearted and fun, and there are a few genuinely funny parts. The translation isn't the best, but it's definitely passable. You may notice some poor grammar and weird sentences: "She smiled with her usual tone of voice."  The Achievements are almost all unmissable, though there's the same secret Achievement as in Volume 0.   [h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1] Pros: + The same attractive catgirl characters + Steam Achievements and Trading Cards + An adult patch is available, but ...  Cons: - ... the game is already a bit pricey, and the adult patch doubles the cost - Some grammatical errors and other weirdness - No choices or control; just watching and clicking  [h1]CONCLUSION[/h1] Nekopara Volume 1 is an enjoyable visual novel with beautiful, lovable catgirl characters, but a somewhat banal script and no choices or real replayability. Anyone interested in the adult version of the game needs to realise it will cost them double the price of the 'safe' version on Steam, and the Steam version completely skips the erotic scenes that are included in the patch.

Just realized I don't like kawaii things
The first of the many games so far (4 games total atm Nekopara Vol1-3 and a prequel Vol 0)  Our main protagonist Kashou leaves his family and starts up his shop called La Soleil (a cake and patisserie/ Pastry shop)  When the unexpected happens two of his family "cats" Chocola and Vanilla ended up being delivered to his new store/home with him thanks to his sister   and then the adventures start with Kashou starting up his business and looking after her two catgirls or Neko's if you prefer.  It's pretty good just like all the others (depending if you played VOl 0 first or if this is your first) The design/art of this game is really great and is worth the money. (imo)  Only thing I kind of wish they could've added to this game were decision making but I guess it would take alot longer and more money to do that stuff ether way though it's a really fun game and again worth the money.   (And if you’re wondering why I'm doing a review with the amount of hours I have in it, it's because I had vol 0-2 on my other steam account before I lost it so yeah... REVIEW!!)
go out and meet girls, this shit only makes you more awkward
first review ever  this game and its predecessor are a huge waste of money  no naked catgirls anywhere in both games,so you obviously buy the  censored version X-(   better try and get the uncensored japanese versions if you want to see  some boobs.........  otherwise just press and hols crtl left and skip through the hole game in a few minutes.......  worst of all, i won't get the wasted time back
Very Very good game i recomend you play(also anyone know the link to the free version of the 18+ my friend just got the game and wants to get it for free)
Well, looks like I've been added onto another watchlist.
Best game eu west.I'm starting a new religion based on nekopara
This is the best game I've played so far My life is finally good :3
Nekopara devs can i borrow the characters for a story that i am making Nekopara fans and undertale fans Unite
Very sexy girls
This is funny, cute and I am not sure whether I want a catgirl of my own or whether I should hand myself in at the nearest police station for having watched this. Thumbs up.
All these Nekos.... so damn Kawaii
there's no way I actually played this right oh shit fuck
Very good game.
this is a peice of shit game
So if Shigure is like my little sister, and she raised the nekos as there mother, then am I screwing my sister's daughters or my sisters cats? Please help, im confused. 11/10
I love kitties :3
Good story, deep characters and very emersive.
Bought this for mature content. Got caught completely off-guard when the feels arrived.  10/10 would cry over catgirls again.
I was offered this game and i let me tell you that the achievement "That something that shakes..." is the most satisfying achievement you can get   [spoiler] Bouncy, Bouncy, Shake that screen off ;)	[/spoiler]
Catgirls ✔ R18-Patch ✔
i tried this with my cat and she bit me super bad but at least now i know cats can't bake pastries
GOD LEFT ME UNFINISHED!

I Just Love My Nekos uwu
Honestly just here for neko girls- great game 11/10.
love this <3
I do not like this because we can't touch them like a (Nekopara Vol 0) >,<
This game....This game....This damn game...Is addictive.  Day 45: Still waiting for nekopara Vol.3 Side note: Also waiting for 50 mins of NEKOPARA Ova :3
WEEB DansGame
"You wouldn't download a cat"  F*ck you I just did! And I f*cked them too!
This game is waaay stealthier than Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Metal Gear Solid, Hitman, and Dishonored combined
It's a visual novel about cat girls.  Kawaii neko girls doing Kawaii neko things, desu.  2 nekomusume 1 senpai.   weeb joke aside, this is a well made VN. Story wise... I'll admit. kind of a snooze at times, but cute cat girls. pretty cliche. you get what you get.   After playing Panzermadels and Stay! Stay! DPRK, I'd have to shift my reccomendation a bit.
One of the hardest game i've ever played, i have to constantly peek out the door to make sure nobody was there, and then i must pull my pants down while constantly jerking off without making any sound (note that the pants should still be hanging on your feet in case someone knocked), and then i must clean everything up, go to church and ask for forgiveness, then go to a mosque to do a 12 rakaat prayer, and then sacrifice a goat in the name of allah,   10/10 would do it again,
Personally I think this game is PURRfect.  Anyone who doesn't love this game has CAT to be KITTEN me.  I'll stop now.
the fucking fly voice acting d e a d  what a time to be alive
The cycle of guilt never ends.
Best Eroge / Visual Novel i've ever Played ! and its unique since there's chest bouncies option on the config :v  for the update = thank you very much valve, sekai project, and most of all LORD GABEN the creator of volvo for updating nekopara vol.1. I really like the subtitle option.  Now i can play using the Japanese text with English subtitle.  for the next update please add hiragana and katakana only for the japanese text please
I play it for the plot
I came looking for pussy I got those pussies 10/10
best game since 1939
Great game, especially if you love anime waifu cat girls <3 lovely artwork too.
Maids Cats You can f*ck em' What's better then that?
this is more just a guide but any ways  only buy it if you patch it and make sure to hold cntrl untill you get to the special parts
10/10 Boob Physics
Am a weeb. Never interested in  catgirls.  I love catgirls now  10/10 would play again.
Tell my mom im sorry.

100x better than Trojan
Just an awesome plot :D
Been watching NEKOPARA again recently in preparation for vol 3, so thought I'd give my reviews an update too.  NEKOPARA was the first visual novel I tried reading, and it's still the best I've read. What its story lacks in choices, it makes up for in a story with excellent characters and actual depth, which I personally find is lacking in most VNs. Though to be frank, the people who read VNs for the story is probably less than the ones... you get the idea :) Anyways, most of the characters (<3 to Chocola, lol :D) are amusingly quirky, the plot has some great twists to it, and it has a really solid ending - most VN's I've read tend to kind of flop at the end tbh.  A more than solid 10/10. Here's hoping the OVA is as good :) (Only thing I've ever supported via Kickstarter, so it better be, lol)  As a side note, ignore the playtime. I've put far more hours into this than it says, lol. Had to start running it off steam because they made a mess of things and trying to run it with the adult patch installed now makes the game go up the spanner >.>
I like this game very much it cute! 10/10.
Hush, don't make a sound. [spoiler] Meow Meow~~ [/spoiler]  I didn't buy this anime [spoiler] FPS [/spoiler] game  and never played for a sec.  That's it.   [spoiler] WTF NOT A CASE [/spoiler] [spoiler] OH I CAN'T STOP IT [/spoiler] [spoiler] sry for evaluating too late after two yrs passed, I love it :)  [/spoiler]
Chocola best kitty
Ok so alot of people are making masturbation jokes in nekopara reviews but im actualy here to tell you about the game. the story is a cute love story and it actualy made me cry at some points because it was so emotional. the voice acting is cute and all the actresses were fantastic. 10/10 get hype for vol 3
perfection
Cat + Girls = The best game ever
4/10; everything is pretty good except for the characterization, the incestual subplot, and the apparent beastiality.
Want more Meow? keep playing <3
As they say, playing with cats serve some kind of therapy that able to calm your tense.  I purchased this solely to calm my depression whenever I was put together with bunch of noobish in Team Fortress 2.  It really helps ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's hot af
Your sister can't bang you so she gets her cats to do it for her. 10/10
its a gift I swear
lets be honest...you only bought this game cuz porn
My hand after this game is now stronger than my arm itself
PETA took away my cat after I named her "Vanilla"
oh my how lewd -neptune
MeoW MeoW  continue
Here's the review at least a few of you have been waiting for!  For those of you new to visual novels, Nekopara and games like it aren't really games. There are no decisions to be made, no changing the outcome of the story. Just like a book or a movie, you're merely observing as everything plays out.  This story is set in a world where genetically modified cat-girls are kept as pets and servants. The main character opens a bakery and his (oddly obsessive and possibly incestuous) sister sends him two cat-girls as companions to help him out.  The story is, to put it mildly, odd. It gets even stranger when the cat-girls become, ahem, "interested" in their master.  GAMEPLAY  There basically isn't any. You can advance the dialogue and you can interact with the characters in a limited way (by petting them). Again, this isn't really a game.  STORY  There's basically nothing else to Nekopara, so this had better be good. And it is. You'd never expect a story about running a bakery with two "curious" cat-girls to be interesting, but a good visual novel gets you invested in its characters. The two cat-girls are well-written and their personalities are quite distinct. The relationships develop somewhat naturally, as naturally as relationships between humans and genetically-modified cat-women can.  I *did* say it was weird.  GRAPHICS  Honestly, these matter more to a visual novel than you'd expect, since they're half of the game (the *visual* part of visual novel). And here's where the game absolutely shines. Not only are the characters extremely well designed and drawn, the animation is lifelike and fun. Since it is an H-game, there is adjustable bounce, but it seems somewhat odd to include it when neither of the characters it affects are particularly busty.  The backgrounds and settings are pretty average, but the characters themselves are so eye-catching and fun that it's never really an issue.  CONCLUSION  The game's weird, and not really a game. Those are two key points here. It's also (if modded to its intended content) an adult game. However, the story and art are fantastic and the animation is the icing on the cake. If you're the sort of person who doesn't mind games with extremely strange premises that are basically waifu simulators, then this is a really great game.  I give this game five cat-girls out of five.
I can't launch the game I always recieve this message,  DirectX, some japanese, DirectX, more japanese:Cannot load Plugin drawdeviceD3DZ.dll  I don't know how to fix it. Other than that I would recommend the nekopara games they seem good but I don't know since I can't launch them but I bough Vol.1 and Vol.0
Great game, for all neko fans.
The best series of games about neko. LvL of Kawaii 10/10
I have disappointed my family in many ways for making this purchase.  No regrets.
Feels gud man. Recummend.
Would be better if it had Mac support :3
It was just too boring for me.  I stopped last year and tried to get back into it again a couple weeks ago but I just couldn't.
I don't see any real cat.
Well I came for hentai and I was dissapointed due to it being censored ;-; but the story is great
I last played this type of game maybe 5-6 years back and I can honestly say that they have improved a lot in terms of graphics where everything is now more or less animated, even the erotic scenes which was a nice surprise. A bit disappointed that the steam version cuts out those scenes but as others have said, 15 minutes of googling can help you find the H patch. Overall, and very cut and enjoyable game that can also have its touching moments so its definitely well recommended.
after chapter 2 the 'game' takes a rather abrupt turn right into ploughing the catgirls.
Cute girls doing cute things. Story is forgettable, art is pretty, girls are cute.  Well, what are you waiting for? Buy it, you weeb.
turn back and never return. there's still hope for you
nekopara最高
Good, still a bouncheeses games
Como não gostar de um jogo desses né? Ainda mais da Vanilla :#
I swear I am playing it for the plot
Before I begin, yes. Yes this game is almost exsactly what you think it is. If you can't draw judgement from that, I'll elaborate.   This game is a visual novel, so not so much a game as much as it is a short story with some pictures and animations to go with it. You do not play it at all.  For what I was expecting, I actually got a lot more, though I"ll say my experience with visual novels is extremely thin. It has a great menu system. Everything is where you'd expect it to be, and there are a lot of options to help fine tune the game should you feel the need to. There's even a "Bust bouncyness" option, which thank the lord because it's akward to see them flounder like a fish whenever they make a move. It even comes with 80 save files for whatever reason.   Visually, it passes all the tests. Backgrounds and characters are detailed, and said characters are animated and fully voiced, minus the one male in the game. They even have proper lipsyncing and animations that play on queue to what is said. Though the farther into the game you go, the more you'll see repeating animations and movements. They serve their perpose well, but it does get old after a while.  The music is fine, good even. Nothing to hum to, but enough to set the mood. There's only five of them though, so expect to hear the same tracks many times.   Lastly, the writting... Kinda a mixed bag. What little lore they put in place makes complete sense and makes a great backdrop to the happenings of the game. Things don't tend to "Just be like that". It's coheisive and straight forward.  However, they hit all of the sugar sweet troupes for an anime of this type. Everyone loves the none discript main charecter, everyone is amazing by in game standerds, yadda yadda, you get the idea. You'll catch on to the true motives of the game really quickly. It's dangerously sweet, to excess even. I'll admit I was having fun for a while, but it wore off right around chapter 5 when things started settling in. The pacing is pretty shotty, like a photo album someone made of their favorite parts of a story, the biggest exsample being [spoiler] When the two cover catgirls are trying to obtain their bells, a sort of right of passage permit. One day the little sister know it all comes over to help them study for the first time  to the end of some hijinx, and the very next scene they're coming back from a delivery, bells firmly hung from their necks. No signs of an endevor or anything. [/Spoiler]  Can I reccomend the game? Honestly, I don't know if I have the right to. It's obvious that it has a very specific market it's trying to pitch itself to, even more blatently so in the R-18 version which, thankfully, was edited down in the steam version. My positive recomondation score is based purely off the effort that was put into the workings of the game and the effort that was obviously put into it. What you get out of the game is up to you. Just trust you gut on this one.  TLDR: Sugar, hold the spice, but leave the everything nice. What you see is what you get.
[h1]tl;dr: Buy it. And don't forget the H-Patch[/h1]  [b]Pros:[/b] + Catgirls + Moving Catgirls + Fuck Catgirls + Good Soundtrack + Quality Voice Acting  [b]Cons:[/b] - They aren't real - Kinda Beastiality (who cares +  with H-Patch only)  [b]Should you buy it?:[/b] Buy it. Look at my playtime and buy it. Soundtrack is nice, Story is short but nice. [b]And there are catgirls.[/b]
Honestly, I bought this game because I had extra cash lying around. Calling this a game wouldn't do this justice however. This is an amazing visual novel with striking artwork and a heartfelt story. (I'll have to admit, I did tear up a few times.) If you like visual novels, this is a great buy. I certainly think my money was well spent.  NOTE: I also have the r18 version of this game. The steam version cuts out A LOT of content. If you don't mind some eroge content then I HIGHLY recommend getting the r18 version.
When cat people reach maturity, well, things get a bit weird. Thumbs up for the animation and 'aspects' of the story. Great VN if you want cutting edge VN animation and especially creepy background elements. Download the uncensored patch if you want to cringe.
This is a funny little story about Master Kashou Minaduki who has left home to follow his dream of starting a bakery. What he hadn't counted on were two stowaway catgirls named Chocola and Vanilla shipping themselves with the movers to stay near him. Hilarity ensues, and even some... romance. Well, of sorts. It seems like romance at the end of this part, but... I'm not sure.  There is apparently an explicit patch out there, but... I'm not sure how much it would help the story.
It's very good.
I can feel the ghosts of my dead ancestors glaring at me with disappointment as I maxed the bounciness option.
come for the catgirls and fanservice, stay for the emotional storyline and comedy.

Bad
I have a love-hate relationship with visual novels. I love the medium and its potential, but the unfortunate truth is that the vast majority of them -- even many popular ones -- have downright execrable writing. Fortunately, [i]NEKOPARA[/i] does not.  While [i]NEKOPARA[/i] occasionally stumbles by including a few of the typical "visual novel-isms" such as a bland protagonist (not too bland, thankfully), characters who state the obvious (though the game doesn't assume we're dumb), characters who announce their feelings ("You can't just have your characters announce how they feel! That makes me feel angry!"), and unnecessary flashbacks (mercifully few and brief), it is, to my amazement, well-written and intelligent for a visual novel and eroge.  The dialogue is, for the most part, passable with occasional flashes of brilliance and poetic constructions -- yes, really; there can rhythm and beauty in seemingly ordinary prose, even in the gutter -- and I have to admit that certain word choices really provided some much-needed scratching of itches. In addition, the dialogue often made curious use of English-language idioms which, to my utter disbelief, were not only used [i]correctly[/i] but also used in evocative ways. For that, I commend the writers and translators for their work.  You may find this hard to believe, but there is some thoughtful and intriguing world-building going on in the background of this silly little erotic visual novel. The idea, for instance, that the catgirls will be arrested if they wander around on their own -- that some catgirls have turned to crime to support themselves -- provides a brief but tantalizing glimpse into a world in which the visual novel's cute, nonsensical premise clashes with a serious, harsh reality. Even the idea of the Bells the cats wear -- the idea that catgirls can educate themselves in human culture in order to be more autonomous -- is fascinating, not the least because the idea's foundations rest on a very old English-language proverb with political connotations: "bell the cat." Think about it.  I'm a writer, not an artist, so I can't give any in-depth review of the art, but in my opinion, the character design is fine. Some of the secondary characters are a little too forgettable in their design, but the main characters are appealing enough. (My personal favorite is Vanilla.) I think the breast bouncing is a bit silly, but the animation during story scenes is often striking. And the animation in erotic scenes is quite good, indeed.  The music is all right. Some of the tracks wear a little thin after a while due to their short length, but others are quite evocative. Some of the sound effects are bad, and they're made even worse by how short they are and how frequently (and unnecessarily) they're looped. The licking/sucking sound effect in particular is irksome -- ugly, even. I would rather have just silence between lines of dialogue than [i]that[/i] particular sound effect.  The voice acting is good. You will likely find some characters more enjoyable to listen to than others, but for my part, I liked all of them. Chocola and Vanilla's voice actresses, of course, deserve particular note. They went above and beyond in recording erotic dialogue. I often found myself astounded by their voice acting.  I have high praise for the UI. It's simple, aesthetically-pleasing, and the configuration menu allows you to change a number of aspects about the game, which I appreciated.  [b]One final thing, and this is important:[/b] if you buy this game on Steam, note that [i]you are not getting the full version of the game[/i]. You are buying a version of the game which has apparently been heavily censored -- all the erotic scenes have been removed from it. I [i]strongly[/i] disapprove of that kind of censorship. [spoiler]Fortunately, there is an unofficial patch available on the patch18 website which (in my experience) allowed me to effortlessly restore the originally-intended content.[/spoiler]  I believe in the right of all artists to write, draw, and otherwise depict whatever they wish. And there are other erotic visual novels available for sale on Steam -- completely uncensored -- so why was this one subjected to such heavy-handed and needless censorship? I don't know the full story, but I can say this: if not for that patch, I would not be recommending this game. To me, it is unconscionable to sell only part of a product but market it as the whole. Perhaps this is Steam's fault. Perhaps it's the distributor's. I do not know.  Overall, I would say that [i]NEKOPARA[/i] is worth taking a look into if you're looking to play an interesting and sexy visual novel with fairly good dialogue. I would especially recommend taking a look at it if you are interested in, as I am, writing and developing erotic visual novels. It has many elements that it does well -- dialogue, voice acting, character design, animation -- and you could certainly do worse in finding games to guide and inspire your own work.
aint nothing like a good cat tiddie :^)
Quality                                                                                                                     Neko
I was only 40 years old I loved Nekopara so much, I had all the bodypillows and figurines I pray to Neko Works every night, thanking them for the waifus that I’ve been given “Azuki is love” I say, “Coconut is life” My mom hears me and calls me a parasite I knew she was just jealous of my devotion to Nekopara I called her a baka gaijin She slaps me and sends me back to the basement I’m crying now, and my face hurts I lay down next to my Chocola bodypillow, and it’s really cold Suddenly a warmth is moving towards me It’s Neko Works I am so happy They whisper in my ear “This is my bakery” They grab me with their powerful Developer hands and start up my computer I’m ready I open up my storage space for Nekopara Vol. 2 It starts to download It takes so long, but I do it for Nekopara I start to breath harder as the download bar nears completion I pound on my kotaku I want the nekos now Neko Works meows a kawaii meow as Nekopara Vol. 2 finishes downloading My mom walks in Neko Works looks her straight in the eye and says “3D women are ugly” Neko Works leave up the stairs Nekopara is love. Nekopara is life
Every day, we drift further from God's light... I wish someone would kill me now.  Would recommend/10
I really loved the story, it made me laugh, cry, smile, and chuckle at how sweet and loving the characters are to each other....plus the 18+ patch made it even better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11/10 got roasted by my friends within an hour of buying.
Yea I play for the plot;)
good game, nice cats too, and a workout for my right arm 10/10
[b]The cold stares and visibly disappointed friends is a sign how good this game is[/b]  Plus: - Great art (well above the bar especially among translated JP VNs) - Funny as hell - Catgirls (some of us only need this one to buy it)  Minus: - Bit short - Needs moar episodes  TL;DR: If you harbor even a microscopic interest in catgirls - buy it now.
My real life is too hectic, i have asthma, i'm 12 btw  - LRC
THe only game that lets you legally fuck one year olds.  10/10 would get myself on a government watchlist again.  (plz dont hurt me NSA)
Gaben blinded me with his 50% off...
[h1]Nekopara is a visual novel where the main character moves out of his home to start his own cafe in the city. Not too long after moving, he learns his kawaii catgirls decided to tag along with him.[/h1]  [i]When I boot up this game, many of my friends call me a creeper, a weirdo... and some even call me a nerd without a girlfriend, and one even called me a weeaboo freak. When I look at the cute neko girl faces in this visual novel, I don't care what my friends call me.[/i]  As a visual novel, [b]Nekopara is just a game you play for the story[/b]. Listening and/or reading dialogue, and seeing the characters animate (which they animate pretty well). This game is pretty short, and [i]could be completed in about 4 hours on autopilot.[/i]  [b]There is an 18+ version/patch available not on Steam, if you would like to see cutscenes involving intimacy with the neko girls[/b] (I personally have it).  Is it worth the $10? I personally enjoy anime/manga, so a visual novel of this quality is actually fine for $10 in my opinion. Is the 18+ version worth $20? Well, I'll admit it's the first time I've seen an 18+ visual novel with animated scenes, but uh... no comment...
My friend is the only reason im playing this game I swear. I was set up.
It's alright.
my soul is filled with regret.  10/10
Make cakes, bang cat chicks, live life. 10/10.
nekopara is my favorite game series hands down. the steam version is for playing in public obviously why else would you buy the censored product.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Cure to cancer? Yes Cure to aids? Yes Cure to every other disease? Yes Vanilla?  Yes Made me walk again? Yes Cure ro blindness? Yes Cure to deafness? Yes Cure to poverty?  Yes Do I recomend this game? Yes
Why the fuck is this game's reviews so high?
The only reason i reccomend this is because it reminded me of billy mays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtYdDK1uTDI
Best purchase I have ever made.
oh dear
I fucked girls I saw as my own daughters and baked cakes.   cant wait for vol.3
I finished in under a minute.  And the game lasted about 4 hours.
Bestiality inside, hehe                              Jk
I am lost for words.
Nekopara Vol. 1 an continuation of the orginal fan disc in Nekopara Vol. 0 is in short sweet an charming and winsome portyal of an thought out alternite fufture in wich Cat Girls actualy exist and thankfuly this is an semi realistic potrayel. A good game for someoneone looking for a great game to simply feel an honest emotion. This game comes highly recomended even if some of the charcter writeing can feel archatypel  at times
ok...................
Story theme was gross in my oppinion. Should not have bought. Regrets.
is best animu i r8 9/11
Let me answer your first and only question: Does this game have the good-good?  Yes. This game is the answer to all of your favorite cat girl dreams. And a some what incest relationship with your little sister that doesn't make any sense because she knows things that any other little girl shouldn't.  Let's be honest, the storyline here is as realistic as any other porn plot, but this game is actually pretty to look at, and really does require headphones, however, at the same time, it doesn't require any pants or lotion, because by the time something *does* happen, you're dripping with "How are my cat girls going to give the owner a boner this time?" if that's not a plus, then I don't know what is.  The first time I played this, I didn't have the 18+ Patch on, and I still generally enjoyed it, so in my expert opinion, you can still have a good time without any of having to download the porn patch. By the *low* chance that you *will* download it (LOLOL WHO AM I KIDDING?!?), it does have some pretty graphic scenes (that move w/ bouncy boobies), that are seriously hard to explain to anyone in your family, or at least I assume it would be.
Definitely a game for those who enjoy nekogirls. From how they meet to the dedication these two catgirls have shown the protagonist, it's a fun game to play.
Vanilla <3
NekoworkS/NekoPara and Sayori, simply put.. a gift from the gods. /thread
No, seriously.
Best catgrills on the Internet. Cute, sexy, sometimes a little sad and emotional.  I am really happy to recommend this game.
Basically if you like cat-girls, slice of life, and some lewd, this is your game.
i think nekopara is a really nice game and even with the h-patch not used (which seems unnecessary) it is a lot of fun and even as a straight (no choices) vn it is good at all the right moments, it is sad, happy, funny and very weird at places  you will fall in love with the whole family Chocola, Vanilla and the rest of the cast are great and even if it only lasts 7-8 hours , i still think it's value for money  i also bought the recently released figure set which was really great and can't wait for the ova or to start playing vol 0 and vol 2  8.5/10
gud
Can‘t stop playing it!!!  Best game ever!!!!!  NEKO SAIKOU!!!!!!
10/10  Would exersise my arm again
Best game
:ok_hand:
Anime tits  Was gifted, I downloaded the h patch before I even finished downloading the "game"
Best FPS ever.
Words can't describe how I feel when I kept playing. The story line was actually good, i kept continuing because im interested on the story. Also once you have that R18 patch, you know that 3 hours spent time would be more than that ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 10/10 Would go for another Nekopara Vol xD
This game is absolutely good.Its theme is that human equals to animals. Althrough,it has,some sexual episodes,it's vaulable to try it.
[quote=author] [h1] k	[/h1]	[/quote]
Perfect score on steam fully shows the excellent power of this visual novel, it's completely no need to say anything to recommend Nekopara Games.  Try it!
Первая была ещё ничего, но вот эта игра это не игра это ПИЗДЕЦ. First game was OK. But this one, this one is facked up.
very good satisfied my dingle
I know these kind of games usually gather the funny styled reviews but I will try and give it a more serious one for people who are geniounly interested in Visual Novel titles (Hentai or not).   Let's start with the positives first. Everything in the game is well drawn and all characters during dialogues are animated giving it far more flair than most games of this genre which are usually consist of static images. The voice overs are decent (even though there is no choice for other languages other than Japanese), and the translators did a good job not butchering the script. Also if you apply the 18+ patch the sex scenes are well drawn and animated, so if you bought this game just for the porn aspect you will get your money's worth.    And those are all the positives of the game. Unfortunately the negatives outweight them by quite the margin. For start there are no choices to be made in the entirety of Nekopara. You just read the dialogues with no way to alter the story. And since I mentioned the story, basically there is none. It tries to tell a story of a world were humanoid cat girls exist and what is their place in the society but quickly it stops bothering. After the half hour mark it only cares about the sex and every conflict it tries to create is resolved in a couple of panels. Also, not only the game last around 2 hours it doesn't have multiple endings.   All in all, a well drawn Visual Novel with decent echhi scenes but nothing else. No decent story, no memorable characters, no multiple endings, extremely short. Get it only if you are into anime cat girls.
11/10 "Heavenly Great"
Great game to play with your family.
Tooooo cuteeeeeee! one of the best Visual Novel series that I've played
NEKOPARA Vol.1 was an amazing, thoroughly thought out game, with amazing animations, voice, and gameplay. At points, I thought my brain would explode from the heavy lore that i was experiencing, but in the end, it was all worth it, and was an amazing experience. I will be buying Vol. 2 for sure. 10/10
Best game I get from frend I play hav god tim fep
Played it a bit, it's ok.
kawaii
Japan holds technology capable of breeding a race of humanoids who reach maturity in about a year. In most cases, this would lead to an army of easily and quickly replacable samurai assault troops with the capacity to conquer, say, the South China Sea. In this case, however, we take a sharp left through a brick wall and create a race of adorable, female only, human-feline hybrids, whom cannot produce offspring with humans and have no logical means of maintaining population, and are also quite dim-witted. World conquest grows ever farther, but cuddles and fucks aplenty here.  Nekopara is a kinetic novel about a guy/possible robot who finds family and companionship with his ever loyal twin catgirls. Yep, that about sums the plot up. That said, the animation is pretty amazing, with characters that sway and blink and whatnot, appearing quite lively compared to most VNs I've seen. I was quite taken by the animation, and the catgirls are endearing characters, although I sure as hell wouldn't want a real one. Overall, I'd recommend it, especially if its on sale.
god forgive me, i have sinned
Perfect for any nerdy otaku ready to game. Panda Approved!
I won't go into the pro's and con's of visual novels, nor will I discuss the.....Adult...contents that were cut away in this one.  Frankly, this is one of the best I've ever read through, in terms of visual novels. Why? Because the characters are so poignant. I don't know how else to explain it, but there are points where the characters just tugged at my heart, dealing with rejection, love, family, and so on.   Definately worth buying, not a single regret on my end.
nekopara/20
All the nekos you could ever want.
CATS  [spoiler]send help D:[spoiler]
What have I done
i mean theres nekos, cute and sweet ones at that, plus with the 18+ patch it gets lewd, and we all know lewd is icing on the cake, no pun intended ;) the nekopara vn is my favorite! i totally recommend it! :3
Great game gives me a boner everytime i played it 10/10 cant wait for the sequel
Honestly a game from the Gods
No Need to explain, Chocola is bae! ❤❤❤
I really hope Jesus wasn't watching...
holy fuck don't buy this shit fuck this god damn game
10/10 would fap again
9/11 would play again,i love the fat titties they give the cats, one of the best features about this tho is the quick save and load, multiple times while my parents walked into my room i would have been caught jerking my dick,however with the quicksave and load i can just save quickly and stop and make it seem like im doing nothing,   Cons-not enough anime tittys thats it
catgirls are love. catgirls are life.
Good game for neko lovers ^o^
[i]Is very! good game, I think it develops a little fetish Neko Girl, when I started playing. Recommend![i]
You should be ashamed if you don't have this game,. But you, oh you guys, the people who would play this game and resort to offline mode, there is a special spot in hell for you and your family. 10/10 Would lose more friends again.
neko
perfection
glad i invested in a mx speeed keyboard. ultra fast 'p' smashing.
That's the good game. But,the only regret is that there is no option to choose the same as watching cartoons.
kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty
Pretty cute game. If you like relaxing stories with Neko girls I reccomend this. There are a few nsfw parts but without a 18+ patch its pretty safe to play if your not into the games for that. 8/10 I really want vol 2 for Coconut....
Another type of vanilla i like to eat
Cute catgirls! What more do you need?
This is the most exciting and interesting FPS game I have ever played. All the weapons models are painstakingly created, and the texture is also amazing. The game is all about shooting and surviving. The most creative part is that all the enemies are cats, and that's why this game is called NEKOPARA. All the players should try this great FPS game, seriously.
Though the whole process is a bit short, it's fun and all the characters are  sooo kawaii. 大好き！
Everyone loves neko waifus.Everyone loves bouncing titties. Absolute masterpiece, 10/10!
Best game ever no question ask
整体来说不错，但是看不见绅士画面。
like it ........                 r18 patch makes it better          vanilla best girl  lol
While I thoroughly enjoy vol 0, and the first half of character developement in vol 1. The latter half of vol 1 was awful, especially toward the end. The h scenes contribute absolutely nothing to the story, 2 hours worth of story telling wasted, and I would gladly play this game without it.
if only nekosgirls were real
Nekopara (volume 1 of 2)  Length: Short Number of Routes: 1 Choices: NO Characters: Decent Progression: Weak and Rushed Soundtrack: Alright Achivement Difficultly: 1 Additional Thoughts: Dont get me wrong, I like how this Novel is presented however alot of my issue rests within how unstable its plot was (even after a certain point) how the characters were and the lore. Now i mean Lore as in Logic, Although we are given much background info about the "Neko Humans" although i still argue with majority of the lore behind it. I think i would have liked this more if they didnt rush certain areas and maybe it would had made the progression of the characters much cleaner than it was.
No.
Great. 10/10
10/10 Tutorial on how to deal with cats in heat.  EDIT: I had to make a make-shift door lock to play this game in peace lmao
"We're not friends anymore." - Me, to the dirty weeaboo who gave me this.
Meow.
10/10 would lick cat again
Cat pucci
A visual novel masterpiece. 5/7 -IGN
You little fucking pervert
This is what they mean by "A catgirl is fine too."~  Pros: - Enjoyable BGM~ - Fun, fluffy and bouncy Nekos~ - Animated Nekos, gives them more personality~ - Multiple Language Selection~ - A few humorous exchanges~ - Voice Over (although Jap only)~  Cons: - Too much Comedy/Slice-of-Life, not enough Drama (imo)~ - Story is kind of repetitive after first H-scene~
NekoPara Vol 1. is an adult oriented, though there is an All-Ages version available, VN featuring adorable catgirls and is the 1st of a series of 3. There are no choices to be had just plain ol’ reading/listening & a few vanilla sex scenes in the 18+ version, this is an Eroge not a Nukige, so the sex is not the aim of the game, one does not equal the other. It features only Japanese voice acting, a lot of it & for everyone but the MC. The story follows Kashou Minaduki, an aspiring baker who has recently moved away from his family for reasons to open up his own shop. Metal Gear Solid style our 2 main catgirls, Chocola & Vanilla, have snuck in inside of his moving boxes. After some back & forth they convince poor baker boy to let them stay.  Right out the bat I will say that the overarching story is a bit drab as this is an introductory game, though individual characters show some growth so it isn’t all that bad & has its funny as well as its share of sad moments.  The story is presented in the VN style of text boxes & sprites, though the sprites are animated using ‘E-mote’, a system akin to Live2D. It is pretty amazing seeing what would normally be plain static images come to life as they express themselves in various ways as they talk. This feature is also used on most of the sex scenes to great effect. Standard art is also used, with some chibi art used on comedic occasions & backgrounds fitting the overall style, which I appreciate. Music is decent with most of it being cheery stuff and a few somber tracks.  Option wise, it is also the standard VN affair for the most part, with sliders for sound volume, text box transparency, etc. The game features Chinese along with Japanese & English text, as mentioned voices will always be Japanese. You can customize the sound volume for each character along with extra voices. The ‘E-mote’ system allow for... chest bounciness (Press the ‘P’ on your keyboard, trust me) which you can customize with a slider too, though I must be blind since I didn’t see much change.  All in all, Neko Para Vol. 1 is a beautiful, but only ok storywise VN that would be of best value when purchased at a discount as the story was very tame & serving as more of stepping stone to the sequels. The art & usage of ‘E-mote’ to bring to life sprites is pretty amazing & something to be experienced & will definitely continue to experience as soon as I get my hands on the sequels. With a 3rd one in the works along with an anime OVA fans are sure to have plenty of NekoPara for a while to come.
OH Shit this game finally have an OVA!!!! Praise The neko lord
When you're playing nekopara and all your friends go online...
my wrist hurts
The story surprises me. Don't think it would be like that. Good job :like:
All my friends tell me I'm crazy, there's no reason to enjoy this Loli meme fodder, how could you? I write this review as the cops knock down my door for downloading the uncensored patch and with my last free breath I must say this, do not speak of this games name around friends, don't even speak of it period. Simply enjoy the journey and realize what 6 month old cat girls can do for a persons criminal record, and how claiming that you ate your roommate was not an act of violence. As I enjoy the last of this delicious femur and wipe my hard drive know this, Do not eat your roommate. 10/10
its ok
Story was totally unbelievable & unrealistic.
Well... I regret nothing.
Wow I must say I was very surprised of the amazing jiggle physics and that I could change them very pleasing indeed. Id also like to add that I wish steam would not be a bunch of cucks and censor it i do know you can fix that but still an anoyance. Overall id very strongly recomend this game to the familly. 10 nekos / 1.
go buy huniepop honestly, unless you want to click for titties. then again, you should probably stick with this. if you don't have boob physics on max, youre a homosexual.
this is a really awesome game for vol 3 i do wish i can get an early accuses it'd really be awesome
I don't know which demon it was that possessed me to buy this game, but I did...And I liked it.
I got the patch.  Oh boy.
What am I doing with my life?
-Great game ever -Broken P button Only thing wrong with it is that the boob bounciness slider needs to go farther.    11/10 would play again
11 wife's from 10
Boring as hell game, would rather watch it as anime. visual novel games just sucks.
super cute :3
its ight
yeah boii
Friend gave this to me for Christmas. I did not want it please don't judge me. If you hold ctrl it skips through the game. 10/10 all achievements in under 10 minutes.
Checklist of wisdom: Catgirls ✔ Dense MC ✔ MC's name too similar to the word "cashew" ✔ Incest is Wincest probably? ✔ More Catgirls ✔ MLG reflexes for alt+tab mechanism ✔ Have absolutely no life ✔
very nice :)
This game makes me want to adopt a catgirl~
Great gameplay, very interactive A+.
It's reading a book with voices and tits... not a terrible time, but I would rather read a book or watch porn separately. Either way, it really isn't a game at all. It's not my cup of tea.
Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) i played this game at home alone, and you know what... i feel kawai than before
Loving the cute artstyle and how its animated, would want the novel/game to have a little more interactions tho
This game is  very good to meet a variety of Indoorsman is not more nutrtious  That is, some small patches to download their own a little trouble, but the oad driver Eightee ban on the game is not a patch is not cured Overall,l like it very much LOL
Pleasantly surprised by the effort gone in to animating the characters throughout the entire game. Please note this is purely a “Visual Novel” as there is no game mechanics at all.
We all know why people buy this game ;) Chocola <3
Literally the greatest thing I ever played if I ignore the superior Nekpara Volume 2.  Can't wait for Part 3 that just got announced.
nice
水無月嘉祥(みなづき かしょう)は伝統ある老舗和菓子屋である実家を出て、パティシエとして自身のケーキ屋『ラ・ソレイユ』を一人で開店する。 しかし実家から送った引っ越し荷物の中に、実家で飼っていた人型ネコのショコラとバニラが紛れ込んでいた。 追い返そうとするも二匹の必死の嘆願に嘉祥が折れて、ついに一人と二匹でソレイユをオープンすることに。 大好きなご主人様のために、失敗しながらも一生懸命頑張るネコ二匹が織り成す、ちょっとＨでハートフルなネココメディ、ここに開店！
When you think everyone should be sleeping in middle of the night and it is safe to play.  They will always walk in at worst time possible even if its middle of a night...   My family doesnt even want to talk with me anymore.. Was it worth it? Hell yeah man.   Catgirls in heat / 10
I have exactly 69 minutes played on this ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
only played this to please my bae
Bestu Waifu #NoLifu  Nya
It's a visual novel about catgirls.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXRzCWaiFfQ&index=14&list=PLYkTBSuzozCT-BbCgYlMNe_df9GbiOlCV  I like it, but mostly because it's a believeable story.  I mean, from a fantasy angle, but yeah.  The art is good, the characters are good, and the story is decent.  I don't really get into visual novels much, but this was fun.
You know how your mother always ask u to stay home and study. This game gives u an in-depth look of the anatomy of a 'human body'. Not only does it teach you about the reproduction organs, but you're also able to pick life skills that might help you in the future. I rate the diagrams a 10/10. It is fully colored and very detailed. It is also very appealing to male players which makes it easier to 'memorize' all the body parts. Remember, don't get more than one waifu or else you will ruin your laifu.
BEST CHOICE I MADE IN MY LIFE!
:D
My hand hurt...
Well, 2017 (well, the Winter Sale, actually) got me to give in and try these "Light Novel" things.   Now, as an anime fan, I thought this was cute. Since all you can really do is watch it go by (automatically or at your own pace) it's another show to watch / experience.  As a gamer, this was boring as HELL!!! There is little to no input on your part. All you really do is click to continue the script and that's it. If there were any choices, that would have made it more of a game (and IMO, more fun) but as it stands, it has none and shouldn't be considered a game.  But, all in all, this was a fun experience (if, at times, a bit uncomfortable - I never will understand the Japanese fascination of sisters wanting to get it on with their brothers) and I recommend it if you need a break from long gaming sessions. I can definitely see the appeal for Fan-Service fans and anime fans alike. If the Nekopara franchise ever makes an actual game where you can do things, I'm in. An anime is planned, I believe, and that will be something to look forward to as well.  TTLD: If the price is right, pick up this little show but don't expect any actual gameplay, there is none.
this game was monumentally enjoyable and adorable i extremely recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience! 12/10
Good Story ;D
Mehhh...Everything is okey just my cat runaway. 10/10, since I never played this game out of my bed :) [spoiler] why my cat isn't female???!!!	[/spoiler]
The shirts for this game will garner you basically anything except for what is known as a "straight face"
Wow, i rlly love this game ;D  Petting multiple waifu's is fun :D
ITS GOT CATS  ITS GOT GIRLS  IT'S GOT CATGIRL  no petting mode in this one but I'd argue it has the strongest story of the 2 volumes released so far  just remember to install 'that' patch for it :^)
My proudest purchase
The gameplay is very deep, your decisions affect the storyline in an impactful way.
v short, with less-than-stellar story and characters; but pretty good musics and super polished in its art really only worth it if you just want to look at cute catgirls for like less than a day, though i don't think it's worth the price tag
Dear you, the buyer,  What a adventure this was. Chocola, Vanilla, and all the kittens at it again! Great time for the whole family. Good pussy mein. In total I feel that what the fuck is a tambourine.
Vanilla Best Grill
lol
Don't play this game without the r-18 stuff or you'll be missing a lot, and by a lot i mean A LOT.  Oh and also uhh, just prepare tissues by your mouse cause you know.. you might need to sneeze or something.. you know..
You can stream R-18 scene to your friends, but you can`t pet them.  69/10 I should do something more important in my life
Oh god,Why am I buying this.......Why that bloody man have THAT with his cat girls......I am so done right now.......But it's good..I think?
This game is pretty much porn with some really detailed dialogue on how the porn starts. So, if you like trashy romance novels, you're gonna enjoy yourself.
can't say i've played this game ironically.
This game needs a lot of preps before you play. First, you need to isolate yourself from others except network. That means, lock your room door and window, and make sure nobody else in your house. Then you have to set your steam account offline so that people will still talk with you as if you are normal after you're done with the game. Third, for some people, napkin is necessary; for a small number of people, 5-hour energy is a must-have; for an extremely few, a doctor is recommended. And last but perhaps the most important one: STAY FXXKING AWAY THE CATS!  Embrace this mental destructor with your regret and guilt.  BEST ANIMAL ABUSE GAME, will never play it again....probably...possibly...
Ok, I want to be honest.  NekoPara is my favorite visual novel.   I mean, come on, agree with me. Who never thought about Nekos and how nice it would be for them to be real. Well, NekoPara lets your wish come true. IN A VERY GOOD WAY. First of all, I should warn you, since it's on steam, this is the ALL-Ages version, means no "special" scene's and censorism, but still, that doesn't kill this for me. I love the story and the characters into the absolute. You really recognize that this visual novel was made with lots of love and hard work. The drawings are good, the story better and the characters are the best. I love how vanilla changes her way to think of her "master" Kashou. First, she dislikes him a bit, but then slowly she begins to fall in love with him. Also, the music is just great.  Huh, I love NekoPara. 10/10, You should definatly buy it if you like Nekos and Visual Novels!  (Btw, an Anime is coming soon. Before someone insults me, I mean an "OVA"!)
Got the uncensored patch and I gotta say Made me enjoy the game a whole lot more 👍
I see cat I click buy 10/10 play with patch XD
:)
CRINGE
Patch might make it slightly better for some people.
Just make sure to close the door and to use headphones.
Amazing experience with Chocola and Vanilla. Would recommend for fellow anime lovers out there ♥
This game liberated me multiple times. Cannot recommend enough... Euaaaaaah!  (Game recieved for free because a good friend knows my tasted very well. Merry Christmas!)
u will see a cute catgirls in this game prepare ur tissue , dont play this game while there is ur parents or ur family ,  u will see jiggle jiggle things here u will smile , without a reason , and i ll fudging recommend this game to those who love  fudging LN with jiggle
Chest bounciness slider? Check Make boobs jiggle anytime? Check Mutated 2-D Cat women? Check  This game is the future and will revolutionize relationships between the 3-D Fleshbag version waifu to 2-D Waifu (AKA Waifu 2.0!)   For all those who picked Chocola over Vanilla. Your waifu ain't SHIT  10/10
Is this what happens when japan trys to inter-breed anime and visual novels? This is freaking insane i got VOL.0 along time ago and with the 2016 christmas sail i decided to buy the whole back with a good of a reason as why not because I watched a short reveiw from somebody who lives in 4-Chan and finished The VOL.0. I always loved Visual Novels and this is really high qaulity even though their arnt any choices for me so far I dont really care its a really nice and cute but thats what you get when you combine fluffy cats, Japan, and japanese anime girls. Also this game doesen't capture how much of giant asses cats are, cats are selfish, ego centric furbags... But they are so freaking fluffy... you can't resist but pet them XD. Anyways 10/10 or at worst 9/10 but I cant find my self going lower then that its just so happy and light hearted early on atleast, I say atleast at first because I hear its like bringing your junk to a crusade. Anyways over all... Freaking Japan Man...
Girls with cat ears> girls without cat ears. :333 9/10 because no petting mechanics
Disappointed. I used to play this the r-18 version so i thought it would be the same but they completely censored it and removed those good parts.
Best gift I've ever had.
fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck   10/10 vanilla best waifu
Nekomimi ga suki desu.
Not too recomended (6/10) Pros : • Love animation • Cuteness high level • Flirting a bit  Contras : • Bored (?) (Or maybe, basicly i don't like VN)
I patched it, not knowing what I was expecting.  Would dissapoint myself and all those around me again.  10/10
Cute little story to read along.  Also if you shake the window the catgirls bounce in it.  If you like Catgirls you will like this if not search something different.  I liked it.
10/10 for the "koetjing-koetjing lucu" inside the game.
best  game EUW
nice game :)
Masterpiece
Best stealth game ever.
Cashew doesn't know about true freedom and right to choose
Great animation and it is what it is, you know what you are buying.
Wonderful game!
Art, story and music is well done im not proud but i recommend this game to all anime lovers out there  also there is an h version of this game online, just saying, has more "scenes" with your catgirls if you know what i mean.
If cute cat girls are your thing.. 10/10
Still A Better Love Story Than Twilight
Huge fan of Sayori but the... "game" was plain boring.... The visual are pretty as expected from Sayori but... Man I was so bored but Im not a visual novel fan at first so... Eh.
Note: I played the non-patched adult version, meaning no sexual content was shown or told, but time lapsed over.  I had to read these in short bursts, like a chapter each.  People kept implying it was a porn-game with the screenshots I kept seeing so wasn't interested in getting it. A friend gifted me this and Vol 0. I read vol 0 first and wrote a review for that then started reading this. (Vol 0 review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/385800 )  There's a lot of tear jerking moments that at times seems overwhelming or ubundent, or just drones on as filler that it gets annoying and want to move on. The characters you meet are unique in their own way. The animation for a VN seemed good. Voices... I guess were okay? Usually prefer english dub in Anime so... what do I know?  How the story ended left a sour taste in my mouth... felt it should've ended a few chapters sooner.  However... despite all that, I loved it. I was slowly warming up & understanding the characters and the world they lived in. My only constant irk was catgirls always refering to their owners as "master"... I understand it's part of that world but just felt awkward, always, when they tell that to the guy you're viewing from that it feels like they're saying that to the reader directly.  There was suggestive themes that I didn't mind since it didn't get carried away or annoying, as they were either comical or romantic... however some parts were overly romantic that I wanted to throw up! (I'm not a romance person, obviously.)  This is a good read though. The story is actually interesting overall and the characters have their purpose in the story, regardless of how they were designed. This isn't a porn game, this is a story with minor adult themes but not focused on such things.  I have no interest in getting the 18+ or patch as I prefered, in this VN, to time lapse them and let me speculate what could happened on the after-math scene. Wouldn't feel comfortable to see such a thing with these characters.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url] Join and/or follow if you wish.

MEOOOWWW!!!
(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
haha! xd
Press P for life
Cute cat girls, Maid Coffee. Everyone can love this Game <3
If you live alone, buy it.  If you live with other people(roommates, friends, family), buy it only if you have the stealth skills on par with the likes of Solid Snake, Assassin Creed MCs, Agent 47, Corvo Attano, f*cking Batman, Sam Fisher or max-leveled stealth-archer Dragonborn.  After I bought this game, my stealth skill surpass all of those I mentioned. The last time my family members looked at me in the eyes was years ago.
What the fuck. Thats's all there is to say..
it's decent
yeah...its catgirl
It's catgirls.
Nut
Saw cute catgirl, buy the game Didnt expect that you can **** them Pretty short but perfect visual effect  Disappointed that steam ****ung censored my kawaii cats
(´・ω・｀) Cute as Shit.  20/10 Cocconuts would Nut Again
the only time i've ever jacked off to cats
So I bought this game just expecting a simple slice of life visual novel.  Oh boy was I stuck between a rock and a hard place.   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good
I don't really know what else there is to be said about this visual novel. The full animation and art style for the characters is great, but the plot is fairly basic. If you're looking for something more story rich, then I wouldn't recommend this game. However, for what it is and the time you can get through it, it's okay. Also tsundere protagonist and boobies, that's nice too.
Tis the best game to have kittens falalalala la la la la
Nekopara is a good game.
Quick Achievements, mainly the reason i bought this game. I also bought it because of the henta.... I MEAN QUICK TRADING CARDS! TRADING CARDS NOTHING ELSE YOU BAKA....
had a good fap ey *also check out my soundcloud, soundcloud.com/n3komusic , i make "okay" music*
Catgirls are adorable ^_^ also the story is pretty amazing, I'll give a perfect 69/69
For years Mankind was searching for the answer to Life. It´s 42. Like all ages of the Characters combined.
看什么评论还不去买!!!どんなコメントを見ても買いません!!!See what comments are not to buy!!!
If she's not 2D, she's not for me.
do what u gotta do
I'm allergic to cats. I'm not sure if this is a good substitute. I still feel sick. I guess it'll do.
Two nukes weren't enough.
Great CG, great soundtrack, cute catgirls. Perfect for me and I suggest you to try it out
Nekopara Vol. 1 is a Japanese anime Visual Novel. This story is an alt future slice of life story with an "eroge" love triangle. I thought it had good, understandable, cute, funny and interesting story. It has great artwork, japanese voiceovers, english subtitles, animation, music and sound.    Has more animations of characters, including a chest bouncyness slider.  It is a cliche anime story, characters and fanservice.  There was no choices, but Good for 5 hours of "Reading". Has Easy steam achievements and badge cards.  Has a movie gallery and a scene gallery.  It has a free hentai patch, wow nice extra hentai material, blurry xxx.   Warning: NSFW, NSFH and could give men a boner. I needed a shower after finishing this. Nudge Nudge Wink Wink.  Might be worth the full price, but better to get this on sale or with the Nekopara Bundle.

(´・ω・｀)  Very Cute, Amazing game!
Cute Cat OMG ㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇ Can't stop ㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇ ㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇ ㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇㅇㅅㅇ
Cute horny maid neko girls. what more do you need
This game was great, It kept me up all night when I first played and like cats are so fucking kawaii!
Looks likes it's that time of season again  [spoiler] Mating Season [/spoiler]
Nekos.
The greatest game ever, AM I RIGHT FELLAS?!
I cant imagine, anyone regardless of their age, gender, colour whatever not like this.  This is the solution to all our world problems.
I came so hard my cumm hit the ceiling.
Im a OTA-COOL :D I like cats. I don't have a girlfriend. This game is perfect for me. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST VN I EVER READ AND DONT FORGET TO LEARN HOW TO PATCH THIS ONE 1000/10  Nekopara Vol.2 im comming
I'm so alone.
Held down spacebar.  Got achievements.  I think there were cats or something too.
I recommend this game.  This is my first VN experience.  I was VN-curious, and when I saw this one with all the cat-girls, I thought that seems right up my alley!  I got this on sale for like 3 or 4 bucks, and I played all the way through.  I like: - the artworks - the musics - the character development.  I really enjoyed the characters.  In fact, there is a semi-crisis near the end and I felt all sad for them. - the story was pretty decent. - lots of cat-girls!  I didn't like: - there was nothing about this I didn't like!  With all that said, I feel like this isn't for everybody.  If you're into VNs or cat-girls, then get this on sale.
This game gave me a brand new outlook on my life.
Kitty titty
Cat girls, enough said.
Nekos who talk and have se...fun with you, what's there to hate?
Pro's: Beautiful story Catgirls The Wonderful E-Mote System  Con's: None at all  What's more to ask for? Go buy it!  NOMINATED FOR STEAM AWARDS
God dammit, Tom. Stop gifting me visual novels.
I just voted it for THE “BEST USE OF A FARM ANIMAL” AWARD.  Couldn't think of a better game to use this nomination for. Just writing this for the badge tho. lol
catgirl haven right here xd
mom walked in. explained im not gay and they are female cats. made things worse. WOULD MAKE MY ONE LAST PARENT DISOWN ME AGAIN
Easy achievements :^ )
Best game, you wouldn't believe it. Cat girls, the best. You've never seen catgirls like this before.  7.8/10 too many catgirls
dude this game has catgirls fuck yeah
What can I say? I came here for the options menu and came out feeling enlightened on the status of human-cat hybrid welfare. This message then proceeded to get destroyed when they start getting naked and getting 'plot' heavy. This is one for the ages ladies and gentlemen.
Whooooaaaa dude.
Mom looks at me with eyes of disgust and dad is proud of me. Nya/10
(ノ≧∇≦)ノ
Love this game lol
Its ok.
A lovely story about a guy trying to make his own life separated from his family with the bakery La Soleil, when suddenly a box starts moving and inside there´s two cat girls! Chocola and Vanilla! Now from now on they´re gonna start the bakery together, have trouble,fun,sex and a very touching story between a Guy and his beloved catgirls.
my right arm is satisfied  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
以投家畜的最佳用途
Prepare yourself when playing this game. THis might be the most exhausting FPS you have ever played...
Probably not a good investment, but still good.
10/10. Would bang cats again.
Shigure needs to get gassed.
Visual novel about cute cat girls doing cute things.
Roses are red. Violets are blue. Catgirls not real ? A cat is fine too.
Really enjoyed the adorable characters and the cute story. Looking forward to playing the other volumes.
LOVE IT!
incredible plot XD
I sexually Identify as a neko. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of pouncing on my master, pawing at his bulge and saying "owo what's this?" People say to me that a person being a Neko is Impossible and I’m a fucking weaboo but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install cat ears, a fluffy tail, and feline hormones in my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Chocola" and respect my right to welcome master home. If you can’t accept me you’re a nekophobe and need to check your otaku privilege. Thank you for being so understanding, nyaaah~.
Buy this game and I'm sure you will buy all the next volume like me  Good UI / Good Graphic / Good music / Good story if you like novel, you gonna love this. What are you waiting for ?  catgirl are cute, that all reason
Wank Bank created duuuh
"better stealth experience then metal gear solid" 10/10 -IGN  Also I dont know how but the 18+ patch just magicly instaled itself on my computer i have nothing to do with this. i swer on me mum m8
This game just looks so pleasant and Weebie! who wouldn't like to play it.  Of course if you're unsure then this may help you decide if it's for you -  It's a VN so there's little gameplay and no choices but the story is quite nice and the art is really clean! the characters speak and even move and erm... Bounce. The game nicely caters to your fanservice needs with cat-girls, but it's all very linear like a kinetic novel.  You don't have choice between your hoes, despite it saying "dating sim" in the tags, it in fact follows the two simple-minded neko girls Chocola and Vanilla as they're being cute around Kashou Minaduki, the owner of La Soleil. The whole Nekopara bundle is probably about 20 odd dollars all up so it's reletively cheap for such a pleasant experience.  It's basically a kinetic novel but if you like cat girls you should buy it.
I died from cuteness overload
learn to play a game with left hand simulator ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Welp to start off, the story was fun to go through , did give off a deep mood by the end of it, had some interesting scenes that only mature people can see :3   But all together it was a great Volume of nekopara  the story was great, (Didn't cry at all ) Soundtrack was just perfect  Made me laugh and i enjoyed spending nearly 4 hours playing through this :P 10/10 would "NOT" cry over again
These cats are just so adorable. I think when I play more I will die of diabetes... xD
I saw an anime character
Made me cry in more than 1 place
I nominated this game for an award >w<  NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.
Amazing game. Keyboard and mouse gets sticky often, but that's not too much of a problem
boobs/10
My heart already melted with this...
Shut up and take my money. Cats the best
a fun game and you can run it on a potato
i love this game, all is so cool
Nyan (´・ω・｀)
best game ever
Bakery full of Cute Catgirls, what more could you possibly want? P.S Bring Tissues
A deeply emotional Visual Novel about the troubles of a young man running away from his responsibilities only to have them catch up to him. In this VN we see our main character adapt to new enviorments, meet old family and forge bonds that will affect him for years to come  10/10
The most adorable game i have played so far. Best game for cat girl lovers~
Cashew is a lucky dude
best FPS game ever 10/10
i HAD THE BEST JERKOFF FROM THIS GAME SINCE 2 GIRLS ONE 1 CAT CAME OUT OMG. LOVE IT. WHERE IS THE SQL FROM ATLE NES
According to all known laws of aviation,     there is no way a bee should be able to fly.     Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anywayy     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     "What's the difference?" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
BEST VISUAL NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ/PLAY !!!!!!
I don't even like Cats or Humans.  Having Cat Humans is my worst demise...
It was uhh, pretty fun. Story is interesting. Charcters are cute and loveable. Money was well spent.                 [i] (Please don't tell my family I played this.) [/i]
cool,,,  and  ....nice
"MOM,I wanna pet a cat!"
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
:D
Definitely a shooter game.. Shooting lots of white stuff onto them. Like the frosting that we use in our bakery.. Psychological horror, indeed.
You fuck the Catgirls, who woulda thought?
Cute cats that follow you around all day, you get to own a bakery, what more could you ask for?
牛逼XDD
I'm a sinner
I'm a simple man. If I see a cat, I'll pet it. If I see a catgirl, I'll po-   *ehem*  ...I'll pet it too.
Best intercousre i have had with cat girls in ages, 11/10!
10/10 would read/play again.   Great game that only needs one hand to play.
Now that this game can be awarded a Reward for its chest bounciness and Maximum neko jiggle physics you can now fap to this with an award with it too only for the low price of 9.99 euro
En heng
Nekopara is a high calibre, age and gender neutral game designed for the 21st century lifestyle, just like other sports with international appeal, such as basketball, soccer, golf, or nekopara 2. And it is our vision, that nekopara will become the pinnacle of all olympic sports. Now if you, or someone claims that they have played a game similar to this, consisting of only hentai, remember that shit is for amateurs. If you want to play with the big leagues, you gotta know these juicy moves.
the things I'd do to these cats
Really good and cute game.
Cats~
A good story dosn't need nudity
I just like cute stuff.
What can I say... If you are a pervert (and you most probably are if you are reading this), you like to take care of stray cats and fantasize about your younger sister every night, look no further! This is the asylum you were loooking for :D  Pros: -catgirls -cute catgirls -more catgirls! -cakes  Cons: -u may faint of bloodloss after several nosebleeds
more cat more girls more boobs
Vanilla <3
:3
A very good game :3 For those who are interested in cat girls... Hehehe
This is REALLY FPS.a hentai friend  ofmine like this game very much！！！
I do recommend this game for lots and lots of reasons, but to keep it short, it's "amusing" how "engaging" this game can be. From the characters being virtually alluring in many kinds of ways you can describe "lewd" of any sort. However, not just the product of eye candy and blood enducing moments does this "game" can make you create, but it can also twirl your heart in such a way no man can ever explain, only a neko can I presume, no, I believe. As this game can toy with you here and there it can also shape you into a person you'd never imagine. A human, a cat, heh, a NEKO. The embodiment of all creations, the starting point of life itself, the almighty NEKO can change not only your mentality towards the world revolving beneath your feet, but the soul residing within you can change from a pitiful shrowl of death to a blossoming garden of tranquility.  In short, this game is pretty good :D
Cat girls... that's all you need to know. 10/10
nice novell
Yes, yes I did buy this game cause it was anime neko girls. Yes, yes I did go out of my way to install the patch for H content and yes, yes I do regret it.  For what it's worth, I found myself skipping through the H scenes and trying to get back to the story. It started off a little slow for me while the game set the scene and pace, but once the story got going I found myself rather hooked and even saw myself crying at the end as the hairs on my arms stood up. Much like a cat actually, this game changes you...

Catgirls :3c
I love Vanilla.
Not the Unrated version 0/10.
珍惜生命，远离什么 cherish your life ,keep away from nekopara
This is easily one of my favorite visual novels. It's also the reason why my friends judge me so harshly..
I see boobs, I pay for it.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
the game has maids, i like maids.
Step 1 : download uncensored patch, Step 2 : find a (lenny face) part Step 3 : Fap Step 4 : get caught by parents Step 5 : Get disowned Step 6 : Die homeless
Nothing beats this game.. It has a great story, great graphics, great gameplay, great controls and everything u want
(´・ω・｀)
I love cats.  I love girls.  I love cream-filled pastries.  This story is everything I could ever want.
It has catgirls, that in itself is reason enough to play this game.
Just supported the game with The “It was totally a gift from a friend” Award.  And yes, I totally got this from a friend, and I have only took a peek of the game. True stroy , bro.
Fantastic Baby
I have to choose between Nekopara and my girlfriend, very hard decision ahead.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
How can anyone hate this game. for real.
Really cute anime game and a good story.
Nominated this game for "Cures Me On Workdays"
Cat girls 10/10
This was a gift!
This was an exciting VN experience after going through the short but sweet vo. 0. It really immerses you in the world and you start to develope an emotional attatchment to your catgirls. Finally Chocola is best girl :^)
Do you like anime? Do you like lolis, moe, tsundere, kuudere, dandere etc.? Do you like cat-girls? If your response for these questions is yes you can easily throw your life out and begin a new one with Vanilla and Chocola and other girls
It's a really cool game for all you weaboo's out there, I recommend this game because i think it has a potential in showing how fragile girls and women are and if you like Neko's this is a great game to start with :D
I saw Dodger play the demo and thought it would be funny to do a let's play of the full game.  Even got my best friend to agree to what I -thought- would be a short, cutesy co-cast.  What we got was countless hours of recording an emotional rollercoaster: uncomfortable bonding, coping with alcoholism, developing the back story and lore of an Italian cashew masquerading as a French baker in Staten Island, Japan, battling to keep the game as Wholesome, Family-Fun™ for as long as possible, and trying to salvage a finale we accidentally skipped through twice.  Nekopara destroyed my channel and I still haven't shaken off all the subs asking for more catgirl/animu/VN videos.  100/10 actually the most enjoyable ball of fluff I've ever played.
This visual novel is one of the best of what's out there. It's the only visual novel that makes the union of chocolate and vanilla more pleasing than their seperated heterogeneous selves.
This game cost me all my friends and everyone dear to me
it's too kawaii
Nekopara, oh boy. You're just a normal guy who finally moved out of his home to pursue his lifelong dream of running a bakery. But, guess what? It's not that easy when 2 cargirls follow you. Nekopara has comedy, a bit of romance and if you have the 18+ version, well, you're in for one heck of a treat. What's better than catgirls and sex? Exactly, nothing.  Worth getting. 10/10
The plot is boring,though the CG and music are pretty good.At least it's worth its price.
10/10
我觉得 “家畜的最佳用途"奖，就是为这款游戏量身定制的嘛

In consideration of the ageing population of Japan, it is a relief to find that there are still young members of the workforce who are able to take the next step forward in small business ownership.   NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a visual novel that deals with the startup and establishment of a small business in the local economy. While not so much touching on the subject of financing and legal procedure associated with new entrepreneurship, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 does delve into the issues associated with human resource management particularly those of the interpersonal relationships between employees and employer. As with any SME (small and medium enterprises), delegation has long been an issue in the first few years of ownership. In fact, inefficient assignment of responsibilities is a major cause of business failure.   NEKOPARA Vol. 1 follows a young business owner in Japan as he works through the bumps and kinks faced by new business owners. It touches on subjects related to the securing and development of human resources which in turn leads to the promotion of organizational growth. Subjects such as: - pampering your kawaii neko-chan employees through intimate skinship - sleeping with those same neko-chan employees to indulge their lust as they sexually mature - acquiring the most kawaii desu attire for your neko-chans to wear to satisfy your filthy maid fetish - appease your imouto-chan who calls you up every second day to get off to your alpha male-testosterone filled voice - baking cakes.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for insight into the development of SME's in Japan under the parliamentary guidance of Shinzō Abe during his second term as PM.  And lolicons.
Neko for Life
There seems to be a glitch where when I opened the game for the first time, my friend list was half its size. Could I please get some help :(
11/10 Cat is cute :3
That awkward moment you have this game twice..... Because not enough catigirls.
If you love catgirls, then you must play this game. If you do not enjoy catgirls, then this game is not for you.
Nekopara was one of those very few games that started me into loving visual novels and as embrassing to say this but i love  it. With its jokes and cuteness, interactive gui by interactive i mean very interactive. Well if u r a big fan of catgirls, i recommend u to play it just do it. Lol
this is the single best game iv ever played
Best game ever
Adorable catgirls who need so much love you'll be giving it to them all night long, no sleep for any of us catgirl lovers.
Maid
This is a dank weeabo game.
Once my parents gave me kittens to be raised because I am such a NEET, f❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ weeaboo, killing me inside.  One day, I looked at them with a sinful stare, with a messy lotion and liquids.  Now my family never looked the same at me anymore, may God have mercy on my soul.   - Lots of nya nya nya~ - 10/10 Naked catgirls - Waifu all over place - Best first person shooter game, if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I swear I didn't purchase this game to fap to, I bought it for research purposes...yeah, research... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
probably the best game ever tbh  10/10 xd
Who need a real woman without nekomimis anyway
Nya~
(´・ω・｀)
Be wary potential buyers. For the cover of this book is quite missleading. I didn't ask for a heart wrenching tale... But I got one.  Buy the game already.
[h1]The “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award[/h1]  喵喵喵喵~！ すごいですね！
best game 10/10 cat girls must play
Very cute VN.
very gay
~Nya ~Nya ~Nya ~Nya ~Nya ~Nya  I'm Verry recomended this game :3
IT WAS ON SALE! Did not regret spending my time with the kawaii neko girls,too afraid to finish the game now.Heart you <3, IT'S STILL GOOD VOL 2 YE
Not bad. I enjoyed the ears
best cat game ever !!! xD
;)
This game is just to cute. A must play if you like Visual Novels like this!
When a game features catgirls, it's probably not surprising to hear that people are reacting to it in funny ways. Especially since, in this case, the catgirl game is of the 'sexy' variety.
neko girls are best
Anyone want to nominate this game as "Hentai of The Year"?
My hand is not in my pant when i play with those nekos, i swear :'( Well, maybe not usually...... Fine, but not always.................... Ok, you win >.< Just kidding XD, this game is so cute, i love those nekos, love their voice, love those BG,... love everything about this game. Can't wait to play vol. 2 :SBpenguin:
Just nominated this for Best Use of A Farm Animal Category.
Didn't you played this yet?
now that the volume 3 is nearing, i still think that volume 1 is the best 10/10 game series
(´・ω・｀)
Do they expect people to buy every game with boobs and cute anime girls? What kind of people do they think we are?  *click**purchase for myself*
Yeaaaaaaah.
Tear in my eyes man,so touching :(
Took me two years to realize I never posted a review to this Volume to the series of Nekopara.  *clears throat*   Are you a weeb? Are you single? Are you male? Are you a gay lesbian? Do you think 2D is superior to 3D? Do you like animal ears/tails on your waifus, but aren't a furry? Are you just a plain out lonely loser?  If you said yes to any of these questions, you might as well either end your life or make your life even more disappointing to the general public by buying this game, getting the uncesor patch from online and *cough* for a day.  And then after that become emotionally attatched to either 1 or all the nekos, wasting even more money on merchandise of these neko waifus for: Dakimakuras, T-shirts, Bed sheets, etc.  Why are even still here, for neps sake its a cat girl and this game is some good shizzle.   BUY IT YOU WASTE OF MATTER *update* Nominate this game for The "Most Weeaboo & Faptastical Game" Award.  Nepping do it
I'm so lonely  9/10
10/10 of perverds recommends this game
Nekos, cuteness and purrs. What else could you ask for? (maybe more interaction)
This game has Vanilla. Vanilla is best catgirl. Ergo great game.
plz vote this game for best use of a farm animal award
Nekopara vol. 1 is quite long than the previous (vol. 0), but this volume has a +18 or R18 patch that made me play this more, it's very addicting for me because  1st: I like catgirls  2nd: They have cute voice 3rd: The art is so cute, the characters move also their Oppai(breast)  4th: A good Soundtrack/background sound. Very atmospheric 5th: Lolis \( > ◡ < )/  The story focus to Chocola and Vanilla and You / Kashou Minaduki of course
It's full of catgirls, what's not to love?? The art is gorgeous! The VA work is amazing! They're all adorable!!
Good shit
re-vsited this game again after a while to remember some things before playing the vol 2 and oh god, this "game" is so good, its basically a pretty book , but the story is quite compeling (CHOCOLA IS BEST GIRL 4EVER)  just here to let eveyone here that doesnt know what they are getting into that this is s quite good game, plus, the uncencored patch is a must for this game XD those H scenes really rock n.n
my friend bought me this as a joke it's ok i guess there's a tit slider that determines how much the tits jiggle so that's cool
Me. Alone. Playing This. With. One. Hand.
meow-meow-meow
[b]Would play again![/b]  I´ll rate 6/9 great game enjoyed myself alot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A game you just wanna keep revisiting over, and over again.
10/10 would neko again
:D Report pedophile game !!!
Very touching :'(
For everyone without a gf. Buy this. It is way more worth the money than you gf
One word. Nekos. Buy it.
REAL good 1.0
If you like catgirls, why have you not yet played this game?  If you don't like catgirls, what the hell is wrong with you
I was with two cats and i had the best time in my life
This game gave me the will to live again.
Cats Cats Cats CATS!
if you're not spending your "best use of a farm animal" vote for this, you're missing out.
It's okay.
I honestly though I would lose my virginity in a better way. Not that im complaining.
Best cat lover games, except the voice acting is bit exaggerating.
I have played this game and I do not know what to say. I honestly have zero idea. The guy dates cats.  Now the one thing I have to say is that this universes moral and ethics are insane, Catgirls are legal slaves with no rights really and nobody cares at all. It's really really odd.  I seriously have no idea what to write here, I'm just writing a review just to write a review. It's a game, it's about cats. Nothing else about it other than it was six hours down the drain.  EDITED: I've bought all three, this still remains.
No idea why bought i this 10/10
This Is Why We Should Genetically Engineer Catgirls For Domestic Ownership.
One of the best game you can buy on steam.  Even if you r not intreast nekos, it is still a must have game.  Happy +1.
It's nice, now i just need to get reall gf :( I'm so sad.
Chocola is my waifu ♥
"You have nominated this game for the hentai award" 10/10 would nominate again
Beating the Meat vol. 1
I like Visual Novels and Nekos, so I decided to buy this and I gotta say: I don't regret anything! I bought this in a sale where you got all parts, have only played this one though.)  The Dialogues are cute and I found the game pretty satisfying so far.  I recommend this to anyone who likes Animes and especially Nekos.
T̶h̶e̶ ̶“̶V̶i̶l̶l̶a̶i̶n̶ ̶M̶o̶s̶t̶ ̶I̶n̶ ̶N̶e̶e̶d̶ ̶O̶f̶ ̶A̶ ̶H̶u̶g̶”̶ ̶A̶w̶a̶r̶d̶
The in-game music itself is enough to convince you to buy it.
cat girls ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2D neko-chan fucking simulator. Musthave, 10 pervy weebs/10!
Oh boy, oh boy.
I played this to fap not to feel. 9/10
neko!
Nyaaaaa!!!
Nekos , This Game is heaven
If you're feeling suicidal, You've come to the right place.
This game.....When it gone to 18+ scene.....and i didn't install the patch I be like "OH SHETTTTTTTT I NEED TO INSTALL IT NOW!!!!!!!"   You buy this game for story ???? NOPE !!! Don't do it cus it didn't have much impression. BUT!!!!!! If you guys looking for your "waifu" or "something" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) You need this game XDDDDDDDDDDDDD  8/10
cooooooool!
I reccomend Nekopara but don't get the Steam version. Not because it was censored but because you'll be advertising to your CS:GO buddies that you're masturbating.  Unless you want that, then go ahead.
Oh boy, what am I doing with my life? Just kidding, I have no regrets! Btw., where can I get my own catgirl? m^_^m  Oh, and for review - worth of playing, R18 patch is must have. You know the drill, otaku fellows ~_^
First time played this....Must say it was quite an enjoyable moment in my life
cats and cute loli hybrids  10/10
Absolutely no cat sex happened. Heavily implied sexual intetercourse is not why you buy visual novels you buy visual novels for the VISUAL penetration. 0/10 platonic relationships would not recommend,
v good
One hand on the mouse and one hand on the cock
Disappointed. Some visual novels gives you choices to affect the story, but this was completely linear with no choices at all.
Dammit, what have I done ;_;  10 / 10  Will stop to control my hand again
I played this game during a bout of heavy insomnia, stress (moving houses/downsizing) and anxiety. at first i was intriuged at the thought of girls that were also cats (once a wholsome concept to me i assure you) but around the time of the "give us a bath"scene (if you've played it, you'll understand) i began to realize the true horror that was "NEKOPARA Vol. 1" after the aforementioned scene i clung to my chair as the lights in our neighbor's house flicked on and in my desk mirror, i watched my neighbor's eight year old son stare on in horror through  his livingroom window into our diningroom window (moving houses so no curtians) as the cat girls "chesticles" ungulated at high velocity. at this point i could do no more than turn off my monitor and then all the lights in the room untill his mother escorted him sternly (assuming) back to his bedroom. after that, i decided to tempt fate and return to the game (i have to finish what i start... i'm also sort of a self loathing masochist) i ended up completeing the game with all but two achivements (something that jiggles...) and by the time dawn rolled around my face was frozen in a perpetual scowl and my voice obliterated from screaming "NO!" as loudly as possible. overall, not a bad game for someone who's into this sort of thing, but for eight year old boys discovering voyurism for the first time, curiosity definately killed the catgirl.
Good game. I would give this my spastic hawk.
That's a kinetic novel, not a visual novel. Play this only if you know what 'kinetic novel' means and like this genre. Everyone else should pass over this franchise.
11/10 Vanilla is best girl
Step 1: buy and download this game Step 2: download the uncensored patch (just Google it, the installer is the second link) Step 3: press Alt key until you get into the R18+ sections  There you go, now you have not only beaten the game but also you've beaten your meat.
What kind of Visual Novel doesn't have choices or multiple routes? This was waaaay too linear and short to be considered "Story Rich"
Lovely cat personification :3 A standard visual novel about human and catgirls in family romance  Nice story tho :3  I recommend this game to all Japanese or non-japanese visual novel gamer, and cat lover like me :3  Buy this first before you want to play the short pre-quel Vol.0 and Sequel Vol.2 if you want to know the story :3  Overall: 97/100  Nyaann~~ :3
i got boner when i see cat ...
I'm a simple man; I see loli catgirls, I give a good review

I'm a weeaboo. I like cats. I don't have a girlfriend. This game is perfect for me.  11/10
Let'sssssssss Fap!
is niec
Very Recommended One-hand game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good but boring at the same time,i cannot count how much i almost felt asleep and the story is just mediocore at best. sure i like VN but i do not find particular interest in this one though mainly because of the protagonist i assume. but to sleep with catgirl is low by my standard i guess.the animation is top notch though so as the voice acting.the only thing is what so different from nekopara 0 and vol 2 is you cannot pat the cat girl head in this one. the sex joke are mediocore at best maybe for me.i know this is an old game,if the story is a lil interesting i might not as well fall asleep.eventually i force myself  to read through till end for card drop and archeivement. get it on sale if you may since if you like cat girl. for this price though i would not even recommend it, not only the story is short and uninteresting you were given no choice at all for the dialog as well since the game has only one route. your job is mainly read through like a kineric novel till the end. but sadly i have to give it a thumbs down for this one since it was according to my preference in VN. MIGHT AS WELL HATE ME FOR HIS THOUGH since this is my feeling towards the game.
loved it played it sevral times but the achivement system dose not work in offline mode so ya...
Cute game, but not kid friendly!!  Be sure to play with the 18+ patch!
I was scrolling through steam games and this came up under "Because of your interest in other shooter games". I decided to buy this for the meme of it. Lemme tell you. The only shooting you'll be doing in this game is shooting yourself within two minutes of starting it up.    10/10 would shoot myself again.
作为正统FPS第一人称射击游戏的第一作，还是极力推荐的，酣畅淋漓的动作感，让人沉迷其中不能自拔，2D与3D的完美结合更是让人眼前一亮，堪称虐爆某召唤和某地的世纪大作，不入不是人啊！（好吧，steam按第一人称射击游戏推荐给我我也不好说什么是吧）
When are we getting the competetive update
tasty fresh
Neko So Sweet >3
i dont know what im doing with my life
These arent games. These are essentially an animated book. I love the series --- PROS♥ ______ - Runs on garbage computers - Pictures - Edges of erotica - fantastic story line - Cute 100% - Unisex ---- CONS :C ______ - You will get sterotyped for viewing the "game" - People Might unfriend you
this is a game that your friend sends you when it's on sale to be funny, but then one night you get really bored and your friend is like "hey remember nekopara? you should play that" and so you do and it's really bad but you have nothing better to do so you play for like 3 hours and then the story comes to an end and it fades to black and you celebrate cause at that point you'd rather be sitting in a pit of flames than playing this game, but then the title screen pops up and you realize that was just the intro so you close the game and go to bed while contemplating your choice of friends and the overall direction of your life.  and then the next day your other friend is like "hey you should finish nekopara" and you're like "no" but he's like "if you don't finish nekopara i'm gonna burn your house down" so you decide to finish nekopara. so you're playing it (and by playing i mean watching cause you do literally nothing but click forward) and it's like 2 in the morning and you're kinda tired and like 31% more confused than usual and your friend is starting to get... kinda into things despite not even being the one playing the game and then suddenly he's off somewhere having jason bourne grow potatoes in his ass and you're alone and vaguely traumatized so you go to bed.  then it's sunday and you're like "man sunday sucks" and hey guess what else sucks? nekopara. so you decide to finish the game cause you've got like 20 minutes of it left anyway, and also you noticed that the trading cards sell for like 3 dollars each for some reason. so you finish the game without paying attention to what's actually happening in it and you're like 40% sure you might've fucked your little sister but nekopara is finally over so you don't care anymore.  for weeks afterward you have nightmares about catgirls running for president. your friends are starting to look like catgirls. you went out to see the new jason bourne movie, but it was actually about a 12 year old catgirl escaping the bonds of slavery and leading the catgirl revolution. after deciding you need to do something, you schedule an appointment with a therapist.   8 years later, the hallucinations are gone. you've got your life back together. you married your high school sweetheart, and you live with her and 3 kids in a nice suburban home you bought with the money from selling nekopara steam trading cards. you're working at your dream job, and everything is going well.  it's christmas morning. while you relax, watching your children play with their new toys, you feel a buzz from your pocket. you got an email.   you read the subject line.  [b]You've received a gift copy of the game NEKOPARA Vol. 2 on Steam.[/b]
Cute gurl, but they ain't like yasuo
-WARNING- This game contains jumpscares!! The catgirls get really close to you unexpectedly, and it sp00ks you hard.  This game has the best grafix evr made, especially the part where Vanilla rotates Chocola in Photoshop to carry her out of the room.  Best Line in the Entire Game: "Oh, you came?"   The entire rest of the game is sh**.
The only game ive ever got all the achivements on. Don't forget to R18 patch kids!
this game doesnt have any fucking decisions i want to kill myself someone please send a noose
Read it for the plot, was not dissapointed

In my opinion one of the best visual novels on steam especially if you get all the volumes.
The game was only 10€, but I had to buy 600 other games just to prevent my fiancée from noticing this in my library.  10/10 would install the patch again.
I enjoyed every second in this game  The story is good , The plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) too. And u can set the boob bounciness in the settings from  Flat to MAD JIGGLY WOBBLY BOOBLY BOUNCE (which I took right away I saw the settings)  And yeah the r18 patch needs a bit of research as they're not available in steam.     [spoiler] If you're not playing the game with r18 patch you're not playing it right [/spoiler] So my ratings are 10/10 as I enjoyed every seconds of the game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
5/5 Would buy a catgirl (or two).
As a filthy weed, this pleases my kokoro.
10/10 would fap again
This is a visual novel about You opening a brand new bakery away from home. Your little sister is left in charge of the Nekos (catgirls) at the home. However she is rather good at being a troll it seems. While unpacking you discover that there are two boxes that are quite heavy and also making noises. Two of the Nekos, the two main Nekos of this chapter, have stowed away and are now living with you in the bakery. This follows You and Chocola and Vannila as they try and become official workers at your bakery.   This story is awesome. It is full of adorable voice acting and scenes. Slight animation on the characters help to bring them more to life. The pros and cons will follow now.  Pros: 1. Excellent Voice Acting 2. Adorable Characters 3. Well written story 4. Quite fitting animation 5. Written text is available in English for us Muricans 6. Character development is pretty natural in the story flow and not choked in with exposition. 7. Voice over is only in Japanese 8. Optional H Patch  Cons: 1. Optional H Patch ruins the purity and cuteness of the Characters. 2. Animation can be a little jumpy and can glitch out the character sprites. (Happens very rarely) 3. Voice over is only in Japanese  4. Story is over a little to quickly
[Note: There is an unofficial 18+ patch for this game.  Don't use the YouTube video tutorial, there is a different page with an actual download for an installer.  The game will still blur out certain things due to Japanese law.]  Played some Sakura games prior to this and was suprised by this when I started getting into the story.  (Sakura Swimclub was pretty weak, just there for the patch...)  This is really funny and cute.  Even if you want the kid friendly version it's worth playing for the lols. Will probably play the other games in the series.
Came for the cat girls. Stayed for the "plot"
I really want to make a serious review on this title as I actually quite enjoyed it not because of the mature parts, but more so for the art and music.  Got this game when it went on sale as I wanted to try and see what the appeal of visual novels were and why there were so many on Steam. My reasoning for choosing this one is actually pretty simple: it's very colorful and the characters all have glass-shine eyes which I really adore. Anime in general always inspires me to be creative whether it be art or writing.  Anyway, the story itself is not bad. It's a simple story of a guy wanting to start a life of his own only to have to deal with his catgirls which are considered pets. If I recall correctly, they're not Humans made into Cats, but the other way around which kind of gives me some moral issues. That's just me, but each their own.  Each character is a stereotype of some kind. Chocola's an airhead, Vanilla is calm-minded but always goes to the extremes, etc. About halfway through, I actually stopped caring about any of them apart from Vanilla who at least stayed consistent enough to not have me smash my face against my desk. There's one minor arc in here that I made me sad which I won't spoil here.   Music in this game is fantastic, each track sets a perfect mood for the scene even if it's cliche as hell. Art, as I said before, is really beatiful and very well done. For me it was worth the price I paid which I think was $8. As for the suggestive scene(?) it's not really that bad. Definitely want to make sure nobody is around, though.  Also, I want to gripe about this because there is absolutely [b]NO REASON[/b] for this, why the hell are there 10 pages of save slots? Also, deleting them corrupts the file so if you accidentally saved, I don't know of a fix right now other than probably a fresh install. Back to the point, no visual novel, I don't care how long, does not need 170 save slots even if I were to save at every single scene.   I recommend this if you are looking for something simple that you can read for an hour.

Cat girls are one of my many weaknesses. Because of this I’ve made a lot of bad decisions. This one is not one of those. If you are reading this it means that you’re already thinking about it. So stop thinking and do it.  Don’t you spend your life afraid of what others might think. Own you’re life choices, Everyone one loves a person that confidence. Being always looking for approval makes you look weak and desperate. Buying this is a step of becoming a better person.
I installed the nude patch and fucked my two catgirls uncensored. You should do the same.
Best game i've played with one hand
Catgirls:Check H-Scene Patch:Check Replayabilty Level:Unlimited Pros +Beautiful character designs +H-Scenes available +Nice Slice-of-life atmosphere +Cute interaction between protagonist and catgirls +Chocola is a QT +Easy to finish all in one sitting (Only 5-6 Hours long) Cons -Sex scenes are pretty tame (still good though) -Not all girls covered (More are in later installments) -Nekopara Vol 3 not out yet (The Wait is killing me) -Ending has a bit of unneeded, out of place drama (only like 10-15 min) 8/10 Chocola is best catgirl

Pros: +rich cat lore +"puss" +kawaii as fuck  Cons: -not enuff sexporns -kill me please  420/69 breddy gud game
Steam what do you mean 95% positive its 169% positive fu
[i]Joke reviews aside[/i], this VN is pretty good! The artwork is superb, the VA is great and it has animations, that's right, animated characters! Be wary though, because the animations in this VN is quite taxing on your CPU/GPU (It might not be the case on your PC, but it's a little too heavy on my netbook). Also, make sure to set your [u]mipmap quality[/u] setting for this game in your GPU control panel to [u]"High Quality"[/u], since setting it to "Performance/Low Quality" will make the characters in animated scenes blurry. How about the story you say? Well it's there and it does its job, but it's there so you can see cute catgirls moments and nothing else really. Also there's no different conversation choices and ending for this VN, but you're going to see catgirls anyway, so i won't worry too much about that part. In conclusion, if you like animated catgirls and you don't mind going through texts to see more animated catgirls, go buy this VN! -billy96
I thought about going out and maybe finding myself a gf but now I'm thinking I'll be just fine.  Side note: If you're not playing with the 18+ patch, you ain't playing it right.
The world of NEKOPARA sounds interesting enough. At some point, genetic engineering has progressed to the point where catgirls are available as pets, companions, and whatnot. Nowadays, there are less stray catgirls, and there are hints of problems with some involved in criminal activity. To combat this problem, catgirls with owners can have their pets take an exam to get a Bell collar that allows them to be monitored and walk in public by themselves.   Unfortunately for those who like visual novels with serious storylines, this is not one. Kashou leaves his strict household to open a Western-style bakery. However, two of his family's cats, Chocola and Vanilla, follow him, and refuse to leave. He ends up hiring them, and light, fluffy, slice of life romance ensues. Made somewhat awkward by his initial impression of the two as daughters, the romance is pretty much tacked on.  Thankfully, the ero scenes have been removed from the Steam release.  However, as someone who loves cats, there are some interesting questions that just don't get any answers. Catgirls, despite their humanoid appearance, age at the same rate as real cats. People refer to treating their catgirls as their children. There's a bit of fridge horror in that question. Catgirls seem to be genetically engineered to be sterile, presumably to save them the trauma of a surgery. The criminal element is not explained, though for some reason, catgirls stealing people's food, knocking things over, and causing trouble by climbing tall things comes to mind.   So do I recommend this game? That depends on the player, really. Too bad there's not a 'so-so' button. Despite that, I want to see how Kashou and his cat family do running the bakery. I'm actually curious about the background of this world. Will I like what I find? I'll find something, I'm sure.
This is the best alternative to having a social life.
This needed to be experemented so i did it the results are 18+
this was a super cute game and i enjoyed every bit. the animations set this aside from other visual novels and i completely recommened it to everyone who loves catgirls

I had three friends before I played this. Now I have 2.  10/10 would lose my friends for this.  (the game is censored on Steam, however, there is a patch available)
I would like to give this series a 9.5/10. I love the art style and story. I just wish it came uncensored, or you were able to turn that on or off, other than that I would so fap to it again. 5/7 Great hentai story.
Good Game
i wanna pretend that the girl that sits next to me in my math class is a neko girl
The best option in life to spend my time ♥♥
There's a setting to change chest bounciness...   10/10 would bounce again.
The time has come! And so have i...
Looks great, very nicely animated, touching scenes, humorous, cute, great game
I knew as soon as I bought this that I have sinned. Forgive me Jesus.
Love this game. It has a setting for boob bouniciness. Best. Setting. Ever.

Episode 1. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ  |NEKOPARA| Episode 2.   ᕕ( ᐛ|NEKOPARA| Episode 3.     |NEKOPARA| Episode 4.     |NEKOPARA|ʖ ͡°) Episode 5.     |NEKOPARA| ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Sakura games are garbage. This is the real deal. It has:  + Waifus + A decent story + Good progression + Animations everywhere + Boob physics + Every catgirl is fully voiced + A +18 patch (IMO the only way to play this game)  Only 2 downsides:  - Hentai-like censoring (even with the +18 patch nothing can be done, it's a japanese game) - There are no choices and therefore only 1 ending  Also trading cards are expensive as hell so you can make a quick buck by selling them.
Shamelessly stayed on the shower scene for 10 minutes.
nekos....nothing more i can explain their
Nekos or plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ? why not both ?
Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture.  There are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients, and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread. As a result, there are wide varieties of types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads in various regions. Bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes (for example in sourdough recipes) to high-pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking. However, some products are left unleavened, either for preference, or for traditional or religious reasons. Many non-cereal ingredients may be included, ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats. Commercial bread in particular, commonly contains additives, some of them non-nutritional, to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, or ease of manufacturing.  Depending on local custom and convenience, bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day. It also is eaten as a snack, or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking, or the bland main component of a bread pudding, or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away.  Partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff, bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition; it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions ("He stole the bread from my mouth"), in prayer ("Give us this day our daily bread") and even in the etymology of words, such as "companion" and "company" (literally those who eat/share bread with you).

It may be connected with the root of break, for its early uses are confined to broken pieces or bits of bread, the Latin crustum, and it was not until the 12th century that it took the place—as the generic name for bread—of hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern English loaf), which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name.[1] Old High German hleib[2] and modern German Laib derive from this Proto-Germanic word for "loaf", which was borrowed into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (Finnish leipä, Estonian leib) languages as well.  In many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a "bread-winner" is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase "putting bread on the table". The Roman poet Juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for "panem et circenses" (bread and circuses). In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised "peace, land, and bread."[3][4] The term "breadbasket" denotes an agriculturally productive region. In Slavic cultures bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests. In India, life's basic necessities are often referred to as "roti, kapra aur makan" (bread, cloth, and house). In Israel, the most usual phrase in work-related demonstrations is lekhem, avoda ("bread, work").  The word bread is commonly used around the world in English-speaking countries as a synonym for money[1] (as is the case with the word "dough"). A remarkable or revolutionary innovation is often referred to in North America and the United Kingdom as "the greatest thing since sliced bread" or "the best thing since sliced bread". In Cockney rhyming slang, bread means money; this usage is derived from the phrase "bread and honey".[5]  History Main article: History of bread  Bread shop, Tacuinum Sanitatis from Northern Italy, beginning of the 15th century Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.[6] It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest will become naturally leavened.[7]  There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce "a lighter kind of bread than other peoples." Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter.[8]  In 1961 the Chorleywood bread process was developed, which used the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.[9]  Recently, domestic bread machines that automate the process of making bread have become popular.  Types  White bread (left) and brown bread. See also: List of breads Bread is the staple food of the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa, in contrast to East Asia where rice is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread.  Bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum, spelt and emmer), rye, barley, maize (corn), and oats, usually, but not always, in combination with wheat flour. Spelt bread (Dinkelbrot) continues to be widely consumed in Germany, and emmer bread was a staple food in ancient Egypt. Canadian bread is known for its heartier consistency due to high protein levels in Canadian flour.  Pita is an ancient semi-leavened bread widespread in the Middle East, Levant and South Eastern Europe. White bread is made from flour containing only the central core(endosperm). Brown bread is made with endosperm and 10% bran. It can also refer to white bread with added coloring (often caramel) to make it brown

Generally speaking, NEKOPARA is not a real epic or something like that. The stories are even quite boring. However, in view of vanilla's insanely cuteness, it's impossible to post a negative review. After all, cuteness is almighty.
cat girls plus an 18 plus patch means hours of fun for the whole family
Goodbye social life, goodbye society, goodbye world.  11/10
great novel. Cute and Funny, much like your first girlfriend, if any of you guys had one!! Aahahahahahaha.  Just kidding, dont hate me >.> Again, I support this kind of content just simply cause its a middle-finger to censorship and I hope paves the way for eroges and h-games alike. And more. I like the artstyle, I appreciate the design of the characters and also the fandom behind it, oh my god.  People are nuts for these characters. Including me :3 This game introduce me into Nekos! Nyan!! ~:3 I purr for joy <3
The game isn't anything like I expected but it's a good read. The story progresses rather slow, and the characters are cute and adorable. ^-^ Lol but you don't really witness anything too revealing on the game. It's good to keep yourself entertained. As well as easy achievements. :3 is it worth 10 dollars? I personally don't think it's worth 10 dollars but if you can get this game discounted or free. Go for it, because it's worth the read! :D
+vanilla is cute +there is good customization settings B) +vanilla is cute again  thank youuu zarah-chan for buying me it c:
good
What the hell am I doing with my life.
I LOVE THIS GAME
If u plan on buying do ur self a favour and download the uncensored patch
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a great game, theres are countless hours of fun and there are a lot of aspects to if that a similar game league of legends is lacking.  1. The workshop, this is where the community really has its biggest aspect on the game, most of the items put into NEKOPARA Vol. 1 come out of the workshop and community artists that are dedicated to their work! 3. Unlike League of legends, all the catgirls in NEKOPARA Vol. 1 are unlocked when you start the game, giving the game a total different aspect and feel. 4. The catgirl pool is very big and very diverse, all the catgirls have differing abilities and there are multiple catgirls for everyone. 5. The catgirls looks beautiful - I personally prefer NEKOPARA Vol. 1 graphics and they way the catgirl  is layed out far more than that of League of legends, I just think its a smarter design. 6. It is usable through steam - My biggest complaint with LoL was that I couldn't play it through steam, but NEKOPARA Vol. 1 solves those problems. 7. If you have a full party or at least 3, the game can be super fun - I think this game is way better with friends, as it adds a whole new aspect to the game. You can show off your gaming skills and honestly have better gameplay with friends, as you know you will be able to communicate with them and pet catgirls much bettter than if you were playing with a bunch of randoms.  There are many more pros but those were just a couple i wanted to say. however there are downsides to NEKOPARA Vol. 1.  1. The community, many members of the community are hostile, or dont communicate or just cant understand you, For example, when I try to que in US West, half the time my team mates are from mexico or just dont speak any japanese. Than you get the people who just mic spam for no reason. 2. It can be really hard to get a match sometimes because of the people who take forever to accept or the people who dont load into the game. I have had times where my games have failed up to 6 times in a row! 3. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 Reborn. For people who may have played the game previously and stopped for a while, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn may be a shock. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn was pretty unecessary and has made the game much more confusing than it needs to be. With NEKOPARA Vol. 1 reborn they are trying to make NEKOPARA look like a much more fancy game than the old loading screen stuff did before, but instead has just made everything more confusing. It will take them a while to work out all the kinks but I think in the end they will work it out.  This is one of my favorite games, it is up there with the likes of Counter Strike - Global Offensive as my top all time most played games, also, living in the NorthWest region, I did get the chance to attend the Sakura-Con, which was one of the best Experiences of my life and would recommend it to anyone interested in going.
le me pat head dem those sound ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
bad fapp meterial 10/10 fucking kilmaself again
If youre looking for feels and want to feel lonely for the rest of your life look no further this games got you covered. Come in and let the nekos take you to paradise. Lets be honest you all came for that COCONUT Booty didnt you. Remember Vanillia is always watching you :3
goty 2014
Look beyond the front layer of cute character design and suddenly this game is about apartheid and Stockholm syndrome. Both of which it trivializes.
Not the best, good fap tho. Still better than No Man's Sky. 11/10 would agree.
Played through Vol 0 first.  Disappointed my friends.   Played through Vol 1  Still disappointing my friends.
it's pretty good
10/10 would bang myself again
What more is there to say other than... Mmmmm... I love this soo much, I love how when you complete the game you get all the scenes and photos saved after all of these lovely scenes... so entising. (◕‿◕✿) I am 100% buying the rest to this collection soon!! I LOVE IT!!! <3 <3 <3
Worth every penny
Mom walked in midway through a very delicate scene, minimized it in time, sound still at max, blasting through headphones, i hold a 5 minute conversation while trying to drown out the moaning, it works. [spoiler]I think[/spoiler]    10/10 for adrenalin, get the 18+ patch tho
Why did I play this?
Best game ever made hands down (^_^)
I got it as a gift! I swear I didn't buy it!
Vanilla is best neko. /justsayin  That aside, the story is a cute slice-of-life with plenty of plot, particularly because I downloaded the R-18 patch (which I would recommend you do as well) of the story. Just look in the community forum for it.  Combine a lovely story with a suitable soundtrack, visually stunning artwork, and a propensity to go on sale for half-off, and you get a well-worth addition to your VN collection.
Love the art style.
10/10
meow meow meow! A smooth act STG      worth 5 US dollars
Great game
The most self-indulgent, predictable visual novel that I didn't mind sitting through it.   The locked achievement amused me so much I abused it.
get gifted game cause someone thinks im perv no matter install nice.jpg bouncy.. uuu Ok something is wrong Something has got to be wrong.. This...  is censored?..  Highly recommend 18+ patch
meh...
Nekopara isnt just an anime bestiality Cardinal Pell simulator, its about living your dreams and this can be done with the checklist I have created: -Lock The Door ✔ -Tissues ✔ -Manliness ✔ -Nosebleed When Spamming "P" ✔ -Steam Offline ✔  Bought it on another steam account to play again  10/10  Also there's an achievement called bounce bounce, got it on accident when typing to a friend  11/10
the best features of this game surely are the skip and autoplay button
i just want to say.....BEST GAME! LOL
Opened game. Saw cafe. Opened box. catgirls.png came in my pants. exited game and entered a stasis of shame and depression. realise im a weeaboo. accept it. plays more nekopara. buys body pillow. loses job. gets disowned. watches more anime. 10/10 would ruin my life again

THIS GAME IS HIGH QAULITY SO ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU GET THE R18 PATCH
It's short, cute, and fun. Not into catgirls, yet found it enjoyable. Better with the 18+ scenes.
Catgirls - Check Jiggle Physics Button - Check        ( it's the "P" key ) Jiggle Physics Slider - Check Compelling Story - Check Smex - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Feels - Check  What is there not to love!
This game makes you really want catgirls to exist on the Earth  10/10
Got this game gifted to me and never played it. Installed and started it for 9 min so I could write this review.  10/10 would get it gifted to me again and never ever. EVER play it again
Lol funny game although I got bored in it for a few hours. I wish I could pick choices or something but nice visual graphics.
If lewdy VN's are your thing then go for it
[b] You want the play this game? okey then,buy (Only Coconut :3) 	[/b]
What can I say about Nekopara besides bring some tissues you'll need them for more reasons then just the one your thinking [spoiler] this game will make you cry :( [/spoiler]  [list] [*]Good story  [*]Lovable characters [*]Funny [*]Cute [/list] and it has a chest bounciness slider...Just saying.  Turn up the chest bounciness to full and press "P" you won't regret it ;)
I... I don't know what to say... It's a visual novel after all and not really a game, but, it does have some noice hentai scenes. Screw it, honest review now: This game destroyed my life, and I'm happy it did...
I-I swear this game was gifted to me by a friend!!
with this I can finally enter your world DIO!!
"Boo hoo no interaction" "I can't make any choices"  "Wahhhh wahhhh wahhh"  It's a visual novel for f*cks sake. Do you people not know what a novel is? You don't pick up a book expecting to make the descisions (Unless you read Goosebumps choose your own scare, which is awesome) The book makes the descisions for you.
(~￣▽￣)~ Kinky Cat Girls.
Nekos Good for your health ;)
look, im not a guy for games like this but this "story" takes a while to start but it does get good. I might not have the +18 patch on this game but it still is a good story, its even better if you get a bud to voice it for you. anyways... I rate 8/10 imo
I DONT KNOW WHAT PEOPLE MASTERBAIT TO CAUSE I SEE NOTHING
Money Well spent ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Tiddy Kitties
A guy I knew bought me this game to win my affection, looking back it seems kinda weird that he would do that :P  In the end, I spent far too long playing it and he got upset and left. 10/10 :3
My first impressions were that Chapters 1-4 felt a bit short and underwhelming which was understandable since it was to set up the story of Nekopara even though i took my time reading the text, listening to the music and watching the oppa- i mean animations (I didn't spam click nor click the skip option.) It gets pretty good after Chapter 5+ with those "scenes" if you know what I mean. (¬ ͜ʖ¬) I probably spent a 30 mins to an hour or two per scene. Anyway I would definitely recommend this to anyone because Chocola and Vanilla are the best waifus for Master Kashou and no other neko girls should have him and Vol 1 clearly shows Chocola and Vanilla as the one and only true catpanions for Kashou-sama tho Vol 2 and upcoming Vol 3 will give fanservice with Kashou and the other nekos so unfortunately I can't be selfish asking for more personal Chocola, Vanilla and Kashou fanservice sadly >3<. One of the definitions of Kashou is "temporary name" so I'm assuming it's the reader who fills the role of Master Kashou in the game, If that's so then Chocola and Vanilla are the catpanions for me >3<. I rate this game a 10/10 with the patch of course. :P Btw there's also a anime adaptation coming as well so more Chocola and Vanilla! <3
What have I done?!
After reading many reviews I finally decided to give it a shot.  Its literally better in every way compared to Nekopara vol. 0: the girls are lovely, the BGM is superb and the one line jokes really made me laugh. All in all a very enjoyable game if you like visual novels!  Also, when can I have my own catgirl?
3D girls aren't important anyways
DanK MeMes equals DanK anime Gal  the only game to play with one hand and the other on the joystick
THEY GAVE THE CATGIRLS DRUGS  neko/10
pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Pros: Good art style, and decent scenes Cute characters Easy going interesting alternate reality  Cons: Story is sort of bland overall Boring typical h-game main character  No choices/not interactive  Overall it's a cute story with decent amount of H content, but like most VN it lacks a real storyline and the character you play is so absurdly passive it almost hurts.
10/10 would pet again.
"Let's just say the cup broke by itself."  10/10, would break master's cup again.
UH, I can explain. I bought this for the plot nothing else I swear!  I was truly innocent til I played this game. I had no knowledge of anatomy til now.   The Game has lied to me over and over. When I think nothing will come up it does........  I'm gonna just hide in the shadows.
Excellent art and a really good soundtrack. Story is relaxed but sometimes dull. Length is longer than expected clocking in at 8 hours with autoplay. Some genuine feel moments early on. High quality VN package worth its price.  Best enjoyed uncensored but you knew that already ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Why did I buy this. I could've had a life, friends, a girlfriend, but I chose to buy this.  Anyway, catgirls force themselves onto you and there's a chest-bounciness setting.  10/10.
My life was a mistake...
10/10
Great story Lots of vocab good for improving language
This game, much like vol. 0 did, will make you question your life. [i]What am I doing with my life?[/i]  This game, is unique to it's story, it teaches you a lot in the relationship between 2 catgirls, how to care and look after them, and what to do and not do as an owner. [spoiler]But let's face it, you just came for the explicit content...[/spoiler]  The game starts off quite what you'd expect, you are a business owner and you have just moved out of the house to try and make a living. But of course, let's not forget, you have extra boxes of stuff that you [i]didn't[/i] order. Which turns out that someone else ordered, you and the delivery woman take care of that and so it then on progresses to you noticing 2 boxes with strange labels on it, that has no delivery notice or anything. You hear a sound from the boxes, and notice that it's the catgirls from the home you moved out from.  As the story progresses you become more and more attached to them, eventually making said catgirls your "catpanions". In other words, they are basically your girlfriends in bed and for life. [spoiler]( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)[/spoiler]  If you are like me, then you will probably chat with other people 90% of the time and the remaning 10% just not care about the explicit scenes. Though, this makes the game appear longer than what it is, partially because it's not really suited for everyone's taste.   To summarize, I enjoyed the story, the details were good and, (I never thought I would say this) felt some kind of attachment to the catgirls. Don't blame me, I like to read, but I aint a bookworm.  It's a good game to "troll" your friends with, but I wouldn't recommend buying it for full price unless you basically have no worries about your economical situation (unlike me).  [spoiler]Though, you should convince them to install the "special patch" for full effect[/spoiler]  10/10, would learn how to get emotionally attached to virtual catgirls again.
I accidentally bought this game I had already bought the game, might play it anyway Played the game, because I kind of like cats.  My life went down like a waterfall I barely talk to anyone now, except my waifus Chocola and Vanilla. Don t worry, I talk to my waifus in a different dimension, it will not conflict with your waifu.   Serious review: If you like cats and girls, buy this game for catgirls! 10/10 would ruin my life again for catgirls. Just don`t tell normal people you play this, or they might not understand.
came back home,added funds into steam wallet,ready to buy some great games with great expectations,browsed into steam store...  Bought Nekopara vol.1
Once I was a middle school student who loves life, and was interested in making friends with the opposite sex. Until one day, a certain player and I said, bought NEKOPARA this game also what girlfriend? I am very surprised ~ the world really have such a wonderful game. My only know before have before, inflatable dolls after VR girlfriend, but I do not know how NEKOPARA regardless of the sequel. So I excitedly place open the steam, have found such a liar, not hesitate to place the buy button, after downloading start game Chang look cool, only less than three hours, tissue was I used light. So I am really conscience, shed tears of gratitude! If the second day I with my girlfriend break up so suddenly and let her off guard, I said, in fact, I think for a long time. You really is not my vanilla. So, after I started my love affair with Vanilla. It was "NEKOPARA" this game changed my life.
A fun time for family and friends
I want to kill my self
I will never be able to say chocolate or vanillia innocently now.
i busted a nut five times in chapter 1
[b]Kitty, Kitty, Kitty,...  omg so cute Uncut Patch in Guides  perfect Game for pervert like me haha must have for Anime / Hentai freaks[/b]
Neko Harem King 10/10 would Conquer the world of Neko again.  PS. If you want to become The Harem King Of Neko I recommend you get the R18 version.  PSS. God Bless Neko Girls...!
Press "P" over and over again :V
Besides having a relatively boring plot. the fanservice was good, and with the 18+ patch its even better. 8/10 would dissapoint parents again.
Anime tiddies
Hate those times when your Internet goes out and you cant look up porn to flick it to ? Well say goodbye to those because now you have Nekopara Vol. 0, 1 and 2 and with juicy sex scenes with just a download of a simple patch !  Buy it now, Loser. For the good 'ol price of when its on sale or on a free weekend.
Disappoint everyone you've ever met. 9001 out of 10
This is where it all began......
Press P ftw
adorable af.
I got this game for the plot...  P.S. highly recommend downloading the patch for this game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
After many hours in my room and having to minimize the window when my parents walk by, ive gained a new passion for this game that allows me to understand keys to life. I want to become a veterinarian. After playing this, i think im prepared for medical schooling for animals and the understands of "heat". Thanks to this game I feel more prepared for the college exam more than ever.
lmao how do people spend 1000's of hours on this
10/10 would marry Vannila... If you're a discusting weeabo who has no life, no girl friend, and fap on hentai... well shit, look no further as you just found the best game for you. Nekopara is for you!
H3H3
The revolution has begun people... Go get some NEKOs now before it's too late...
Characters: 6.5/10  The main character is relatable, and his role seems to be something of a bastion of reliability, and, well... normalcy. His sister, although quite quirky, is also well written. The two main catgirls, by contrast, often behave instinctually, and can be unpredictable. To be honest I found their characters a little exaggerated at times, and difficult to engage with.  Story: 6/10  The story is long, but slow. Character develop and plot development happen in relatively discrete steps, rather than a gradual progression, which for me made immersion difficult. The development of relationships between the characters similarly seemed a little difficult to credit. The story reads like a chapter-based fairy tale or sorts. The fantastic nature of it is good, but it lacks the kind of interal consitency and attention to detail that make other stories believable.  Visuals: 7/10  The artwork is quite nice. Animation is basic. If you have a particular interest in catgirls in maid outfits, or the loli aesthetic (ribbons, bows, lace etc.), it may take your fancy.  Sound: 6.5/10  Voice acting is good. A few nice soundtracks as a backing to the story.  Overall score: 6.5/10  As a visual novel, this story just doesn't have quite enough going for it for me to recommend it.  It's worth noting here that while there is a mature content patch available for this game, it's not the product being sold here on Steam, and as such it's not what I'm basing my review on.
I played in hardcore mode, without headphones in the middle of the night
Press the P key to make their boobs jiggle    You're welcome!
This is the type of game you buy for your own personal reasons and whenever questioned about it you say it was a gift from a friend.  Catgirls 10/10
10/10 best game
I like it ...  12/10  if you fangays here are for the nude scene, the r18 patch are worthwhile to download ...  I recommends you fangays to play this!!!!  PS: I really love Chocola , she was so CUTEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[b]Well.... Now they comin up with Vol. 0 and Vol. 2..[/b] < Cant control myself and bought 3 of them.. LOL :D  Played the Vol. 0 and I save Vol. 2 for later. (Hmmmmm... :3)  What else do you wish for when you love cats. (Plus this one is a girl with cat ears! LOL) Its a visual novel with moe-moe cat ear girls. Is it Harem? I dont know, probably, since all the girls love their master (Master = You) Recommended if you love [b]Cat-Ear-Girls[/b] < IYKWIM :v
[strike] Japanese Cartoon-ized Early-Stage Sex Education [/strike]  A pretty good game that my brothers can't handle.
By playing this game I have mastered my One-Handed and Sneak.  And this isn't even The Elder Scrolls.  I am sorry Mom and Dad.    10/10
The game just feels too easy to me. The game consists of two cat-robot girls that follow you around and call you master. I came looking for my waifu, but left disappointed by two 10 year old whorish robot catgirls who are programmed to please senpai. Perhaps I would be more pleased with this game if the visual novel gave you options. However, clicking through text leaves me with no sense of accomplishment.  Still hunting for waifu :'(
28/15 My friends turned away from me
Do you like younger sisters that have weird [i]creepy[/i] crushes on you? Do you like the idea of getting it on with anime twin cat girls that you consider your daughters and have the mentallity of preschoolers? Then well do I have good news for you friend! Thats it, thats the game.   However, thats not the game for me. And I didnt know there was a 2hr playtime limit when it comes to refunding so I'm stuck with it in my library.   So if you're only thinking of picking this up because you want to experience weird stuff, don't. Just, don't. Don't be like me kids; learn from your elders. Watch lets players do this instead.
OOOOH  MYYY!
Ive failed the reddit NoFap....
CUTE LITTLE ANIME ....STORY TYPE GAME
The story of how in the novel which can be completed in 1-2 hours,you can still sit for a day Papa on Chocola and Vanilla.  Thank you NEKOWORKS for this series, because of them I been working out and now I can easily go to the beach. But overall, the plot is nice and cute. I wouldn't mind another couple of parts, and have not regretted a single ruble invested in this game.
I just cleansed myself from being a weaboo.  2 months later i received this as a gift.  Now a weaboo again... Damn it...
I think I'm gonna study human & animal genes and some advance biology and DNA manipulation.  For science, of course.
Cat fetish continuation Vol 2.  Lewd? Yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is a top fucking quality VN. It has a chest bouncey-ness meter and is easily patched for the +18 ver. Also catgirls.
I played this game for the articles. It was very informative.   *buy it, but patch it.
1/10 really disappointed. when i was looking at reviews of the game i only saw trolls saying how there were lots of choices. skip ahead to me 3 hrs into game with no choices finally breaking down and looking it up and finding out there are none! and i cant even return it because over 2 hrs of play... this isnt even a game, it's just a poorly animated, extremely slow,fanservice anime...
Bought Nekopara. Began playing/reading at 11:45pm. Realise a light is on outside (12:30am). Shit begins to roll down by pants. I've been seen! Go downstairs Mum and Dad crying at table, horrified at Nekopara search results. Thanks Japan.
traumatized for life!
This game was a gift to me from a very good friend. Now I need to buy him a ''good'' B-day present.
Ever wanted to run your own bakery, but wished that it involved less cakes and more humping of catgirls? An incestuously inclined little sister strike your fancy? Then look no more!    The sex scenes aside, the story is a cute and light-hearted one that should make you smile and then afterwards crank one out. They felt a little awkward though, as the context of the catgirls is that you supposedly raised them from kittens.   Do I recommend this? Certainly I do. If ya want the naughty stuff, you'll need to check on the forums for the patch, but the story still makes sense if you don't go down that road.   With the Nudity Patch = Great game with a cute story and fairly smooth h-scenes.  Without Nudity Patch = Great game for the whole family.

I hope my parents are proud of me now 10/10
Every waking day we stray further away from God's light.
i played it for the plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Actually this isnt really a "game", you cant even control your ending through route selection, it is just a weiboo movie made as a VN. But well... if you are weiboo and want fap material then buy this !
This game has ruined my life and turned me into a hardcore weaboo.  10/10 would "schlick, schlurge, and schloock" the catgirls again. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
MEOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cat Paradise, 'nuff said  ....Honestly, as I see many VN, this game is an okay for me. It may has some flaw but it's not too bad. Pros + Very good art : What did you expected from Sayori? It's beautifully drawn image of cause!! + Feel lively : E-mote help this so much + Relaxing story : Has little serious moment, for those who want to refresh from stress + Something that bounce : Well, I'm not into this thing much but I think it's a nice touch Cons - Too short : It ends quicker than I thought, or my VN standard is around longer game, idk. - Something is off : I feel like there's detail that left untold, but maybe it's just me - Take your risk : Seriously, You'll look like an Otaku just for having this game even if you're not.  Still recommended if you want some relaxing VN with good art, maybe buy when it's cheap. (I did just that)  If you pick this game a try, well.... Good luck with your Catpanions
The game glitches every time I try to open it, and it hasnt been working for months.
It's actually a good love story 10/10
What do you mean cat-girls aren't [i]real[/i]..[b]WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAT-GIRLS AREN'T [i]REAL?![/i][/b]
"Chest bounciness" is the best button ever.
perfect little visual novel for all people of all ages ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Hentai ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
This game has shown me the meaning of life. No longer do I need to worry about my impending existential crisis that I'll have because I can simply turn to this game whenever I begin to doubt the path I have taken in life. Truly god has gifted us with perfection in this time of turmoil and unrest throughout the world.
Me like. Alot.
My friend said this is an animal abusing game!  10/10
Tits do i need to say any more ? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Don't play the last half hour of this game. Everything was amazing up until the very end, which was the most forced and most melodramatic piece of crap ending i've ever seen. It used most of the tired old tropes that are supposed to elicit feelings from you, but considering they are just rehashed scenes I've seen 10 times before in other anime/manga/visual novels, all I felt was sickness at how tired I was of seeing the same crap.  Overall amazing game. Just stop the moment the MC gets "sick"
this game is so cute and the PLOT is really good :D
10/10 will pay for bouncing boobs and animated characters again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 10/10 will let my parents get disappointed in me again _(:3JL) 10/10 will patch Vol 2 for sure  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 10/10 will fall in love with cat girls and Shigure again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Conclusion: The past 8 hours that I invested in this game was worth it, I can't wait for Vol 3 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) p.s. Maple is best Girl ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Perfect for weebs like me.
Forgive me God for I have sinned. I didn't buy this, I swear.
This is not a game at all. DON'T BUY IT EVEN ON SALE!!!!!!  ....to watch porno manga better google it......
wew lad
This is best fap material 9/11
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  69/69
let me just say this... Cat Girls, Boobs, And a Cafe. 10/10 would buy this series again.
Really ``Deap´´ Story i had to Cry.
This game consists of many cute and also beautiful anime catgirls. Besides that, the story of NEKOPARA series are awesome!!! Though this game also contain some lewd scenes and also dialogues, BUT who cares anyway :D Instead of saying that I like this game, I would prefer the word 'LOVE'. I LOVE THIS GAME VERY MUCH!!!! I recommend people to play this game especially OTAKUs!!
Adorbs as it looks. Also well-written to the point that the feels will strike you. Hard.  THE FEELS.
Thanks to this game my entire family now hate me.
Best "game" ever.
As far as erotica goes NEKOPARA is on about the same level as stuff you can find for free. There's no real gameplay, so the achievements are pointless. Thanks to Steam's ban on adult content you can't even get the full package unless you resort to an unofficial patch, so if you are interested you need to make sure that's still available before you even consider purchasing.  The only reason someone might have to pay for this is the art and the voice acting. Unfortunately, the art and voice acting are in support of a dumb harem-style adventure. The plot is over-written at times and the main character is a jackass. Not the worst jackass I've ever had the displeasure of reading (the male protagonist isn't voice-acted), but still annoying. He's also kinda condescending, but considering he's basically a slave owner that's to be expected.  The weird cat-girl slave-race thing is both omnipresent and ignored, like in most pretend-monsterworld-japanese-fantasy-things. Some of the issues that might result from having to share society with less-intelligent genetically-modified human-like creatures is almost touched upon at times and swiftly discarded, because no one wants to go there even if it's hard not to wonder at the twisted possibilities the writing skirts. They make it clear that humans can't breed with cat girls, say nothing about cat boys, and leave the player to fap.  Not worth paying for unless it's heavily discounted or your really into stupid sappy hentai plots and meaningless achievements. Or, if you don't care about buying actual games on Steam. I'm still hoping there's a failure state in here somewhere :(
The japanese are some kooky folk
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
petting my cat with my mouse  legit
It's a Neko Paradise... need I say more? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1 out of 10 - ign      No dogs!
Oh, Japan...will you never cease to make me question myself in ways I didn't know needed questioning?
A well thought out story, and rich plot. I jiz-wizzed through this game. Prepare some tissues. This game has such deep plot, made me ran out of tissues
[b] I'm sure we can all say that this game gets: [/b] [h1] Nekos/10 [/h1]  (also p key/10)

The sister...Dont trust her.  10/10
I don't have cats but I have NEKOPARA that I think is better than a real cat...lol
Great game, but I can only play it for about 15 minutes at a time without a break. 10/10, parents won't look me in the eye anymore.
The story could use some work.    10/10
A cat is fine too. *unzips pants*
It's ok so far... I guess that I have to play some more to see if it's as good as everybody says.
well i let down everybody in my life... i guess i can play Nekopara now.
Bought it for the acheivements, decided to actually play it. Can confirm that god is dead. 10/10

This is not my proudest purchase...      Do yourself a favour and get the 18+ patch for this game, you can thank me later.
This game has plenty of vanilla cream, coconut milk, and maple syrup, if you catch my drift.   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
How to dissapoint your parents simulator 2016.
I love nekoo >w< dis gamee <3 <3 <3
sex with kitten girls
I am a certified cat-girl expert and I'd say this game is purr-fect!
I've never been more afraid to play a game during the day in my life
Cat girls call me master all day. #lifegoals  It's really well put together. I am not a big fan of visual novels but this has really good voice acting and visuals. I am currently on Chapter 5 at the time of writing this. Yeah....  ( Some brit gifted me this. )
Weeb Anime Cr@p.   >Accepted It >Completed It >Reviewed It >Uninstalled It >Deleted It.
It's a fun, cringy animated story with Catgirls and a weird little sister... and it has a few cute moments. Don't expect to get more than a couple of hours out of it - and oh yeah, don't forget to press 'p' (a lot).
it's good.
Best horror game I've played in my life. I experienced true terror, constantly turning down the volume, looking over my shoulder every few minutes, making sure my door was locked several times throughout the game.   My parents are talking in the kitchen just outside my room... I know they're talking about me. I just know it! They must know I'm playing this game... Minutes pass by, I'm just trying to enjoy my catgirls, pressing P more than occasionally. I just know they know! This feeling of dread washes over me... I have to rip my shirt off as a cold sweat takes over and my heart begins to race.... My breathing grows quicker and quicker. I hear footsteps approaching my room... Then it happens. As I get to an H-scene, there's a knock on my door. It's my mom..... she says dinner is ready. A wave of relief passes over me. I step outside my room, happy as can be and go to the dining room. The look of horror and disgust from my parents... They did know... "Son... What were you doing just now?" That's when I realized I was in my boxers, drenched in sweat, with a raging boner. "I swear I wasn't masturbating to catgirls!"  69 catgrills out of 10. Would disappoint my parents again.  It's far scarier with the R18 patch, just FYI.
[h1]Short Review[/h1] NEKOPARA is one of the best VN's available on Steam right now. You play as a startup cafe owner joined by two catgirls. The story is a slice of life revolving around these three main characters with a few cameos from your sister and the rest of the catgirl bunch. The character development and voice acting are well done.  From a VN standpoint, NEKOPARA utilizes great animations and a full voice cast (besides yourself). The layout is clean and a few game features, such as: repeat voice dialogue, CG/scene/movie viewer, text speed, menu opacity etc., sets this VN above other generic pieces.   Also fyi, the Steam version of this game is censored. There are many guides out there on how to unofficially patch it to the uncensored R-18 version.  [h1]Score[/h1] Great - 9/10
I was in the mood for visual novels and this one looked interesting, plus it was on sale, so I thought why not? And well... seems like I got the wrong visual novel
10/10 bought the game for only one scene gg wp worth it doe some good matrieal :D
This is a pretty good game!  The story is awesome and the art is just beautiful! I r8 8/10, not enough nudity ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
Bought at full price  For Academic Purposes
..... I love japan.
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.

Install nude patches. Play game. ????? Profit
I like tits.
Who needs a Girlfriend?
not enough catgirls
neko grils.  need I say more?  (just buy the game already)
good
10/10 Masterpiece.
This is the most replusive thing I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. The fact that this borderline beastiality and incest is allowed on Steam is horrific.
Very cute VN! Art style is amazing, and so is the animation. BGM was really nice too, together with the VA. I loved this game and I really hope that developers will make another title (besides more NekoPara VNs) following this style.  9/10.
God... What have I done...
After playing this I want to kill myself. 10/10
10/10 an excellent visual novel but the only problem would be:  [list] [*]My wrist (hurts like hell) [*]Tissues (i don't have anymore) [*]The unconditional and irrational love to the nekogirls [*]Sayori [/list]
sure
Why +18 patches were invented.
Pants aren't required to play the game, and lotion is opitional.
Simple Guide how to be the most hated person in your family   1. Buy Nekopara 2. Install 18+ Patch 3. Realise 18+ Patch has 3 Interesting scenes 1st scene this dude **** Chocola 2nd scene this dude **** Vanilla 3rd scene he **** BOTH OF THEM 4. Thats just normal because the catgirls are in Heat.   Edit: The 18+ Sex scenes are the best animated scenes in the game
Man this sh*t is so wrong in so many motherfu*king levels yo…I was talking to one of my white friends and he sent me 3 games with the name only labeled “Nekopara” I said to this dude, What’s this sh*t? He just giggled and said “Just play them and MAKE SURE NOBODY IS AROUND YOU WHEN PLAYING IT!” Then I thought it was some weird porno or some strange sh*t but as I played the first game, I was like “Yo…..what the fu*k..” THEN IT CONTINUED and I was like “Yoooooooooooooooooooooooo…….” THEN THEY GOT IN THE MOTHERfu*kING BEDROOM AND THEN I SAID “YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!” I couldn’t fu*king believe what I just played, It was like Satan gave me his porno collection, sh*t was so disturbing..YET I COULDN’T STOP PLAYING IT, THEN GAME TWO AND IT WAS TWO OF THEM…..THOSE NIGGAS…YOOOOOOO…….THOSE NIGGAS….AND THAT GIRL SAW THEM THEN SHE…YYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO… THEN THAT NIGGA TOOK THAT CAT TOY THEN YYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO……..IT WAS LIKE YOUR bi*ch WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU BUT SHE WANTED TO SOMETHING “DIFFERENT” AND IT WAS SO fu*kED UP AND CREEPY, YOU JUST…KEPT WATCHING IT…AND THAT’S WHAT I fu*kING DID!!!!! THEN I PLAYED GAME THREE…THREE NIGGAS…THRRREEEEE!!!!!! IT…WAS…THHHHHHRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! AND CHOCOLA WAS HER NAME NIGGA, CHOCOLA WAS HER MOTHERfu*kING NAME!!!!!! OH MY GOD,I AIN’T GOING TO HEAVEN NIGGAS, I ALREADY SOLD MY SOUL TO LUCIFER!  So I Just want to tell you all right now..DON’T PLAY A GAME LABELED NEKOPARA, DON’T DO IT NIGGA, IT’S LIKE SUCCUBUS. REMEMBER WHAT I’M SAYING TO YOU NIGGAS!"
Step 1: Change name to KittyKat69 and start game Step 2: Watch your friends list deplete Step 3: ??? Step 4: Profit    Those who didn't unfriend you are your true friends/potential pedophiles
SUCK!  i want etZZI na neko or nude~ or somting.  but fukcing this game showen to me suck story and fukcing give to me cancer.  i dont want die. suck suck suck like your ass.
it is not working at all it keeps saying cannot load then showes some japenese letters and i dont know how to fix it??? If i cant fix it i want my $10 back this is bull ?!?!?!?
It is the best game I played. Зlay only in the R-18 version, of course, if you have a 18, if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Installed Nude Patch
Nekopara is one of those games that make you say "What am i doing with my life" Then after 5 seconds thinking about it you just keep playing.
If you're new to the VN world then this is a good place to start. I enjoyed the entire VN grinning like an idiot to Chocola, Vanilla, and Shigure's antics. I feel like the premise itself would make a nice anime too (Maybe some story tweaks since there's not really much conflict). If you're an experienced VN player then by all means buy it as well. Just a heads up, you'll need the R-18 patches if you want the ecchi stuff added.
Not addicted... NOT ADDICTED!
How to play.  >Make sure no one disturbs you. >Make sure you aren't wearing pants >Make sure you have the R18+ patch installed >( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) >Enjoy the plot
it's boring, but you came for the tidy right
Played the NSFW version with friend. I ended up spending a lot more time on the sex scenes than I expected.  ...  10/10 would play again for "plot."  ... (Chocola is best girl)
Fun, wholesome entertainment for the whole family.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
We all know why you bought this, CAT GIRL TIDDIES  And because of that (And the fact that it has a good story without the nips enabled) I must reccomend such a game 11/10 I'm now infertile because of this game, And i have no regrets
Epic game full of nekos xD
In misery is where I belong
I'm so sorry, mother.
Nice cat... huehehehehe Play uncensored version is not good as i expected lol
Neko Maids have never been so great before
as long as you patch it for lewds, nekopara is ok
Because i'm a huge fan of antromorph and halfbreed charakters, i'm in love with whole nekopara.  I like the story they tell here, a bit short sure and maybe a bit bland if someone want an epic fairytale story but for me its good enough to have fun with it.  As a girl i looked at the +18 content and have to say, sadly its more straight forward, i hoped for at least a bit romantic beside it. xD And as expectet the focus is on the girls, the only thing for girls is a tiny bit IF you are into girl on girl because vanille and chocola are really "close" to eachother. But you have alway's a lil' sausage in the scene. ^o^  Now at the end, if you like cute cat's and a short story, grab it! :O
neko's for lyf
This game is just proof that Catgirls need to be in everything, Really hope we get a Call of Duty with Catgirls someday....
Nah
Nice game, i love the story so far. The bad thing is you can't do anything but click, they should have introduced a bit more interaction in the game like talking and response options for the player.
There aren't many things I regret in life, but I can honestly say this is one of them.
this game gave me cancer
Its not a game. In 4 hours there wasnt even one single decision to be made. This is a hentai slideshow with horrible boring sex scenes. I hope the voice actresses were paid well, it must have been a serious eye-rolling-contest to voice this. If you like to be told how awesome you are on a secondly basis, this might be for you.
The fitness gram 😆🍆 cummy test💦 is a multistage sex position 😻 that progressively gets more difficult as 💓daddy gets 😵😵 harder. The 20 meter 😍 💦 cock will line up with your🍎💧ass in 30 seconds. Lube up for daddy 💗🍆. The 👊💦 riding speed starts slowly but progressively gets harder as 😉😝 daddy gets worked up. Remember not to 😲 cum early or else 😩 daddy will 👏💦 spank you.

Excellent visual novel. It somehow reminds me about my time in the western hemishphere. Strongly recommend. ^_^
For some reason i can write a review even though i never got the game ._.  10/10
kek
catgrills op
This is my Neko. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My Neko is my best friend.
what more could u ask for?   got cute neko grillz, really fit in OST for each moment, R18 patch bonus ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), some cute and great illustration, catchy theme song and the list go on~ ps : Chocola best cat (⌐□_□) *hands down*
BEST FCKNG GAME EVER MADE Nekopara is the proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy 15/10
Better than buying a $100 knife
Press "P" for plot.
10/10 would buy this again in my next life
pls pley gem. adorb cets lel. gud gem pls buye n njoi
This game is absolutely adorable! For those who have a thing for cat girls and constant "meow"'s then this game is perfect for you! The girls are cuddlely and the story is actually pretty decent as to how the relationship grows between the player and the characters.  There are also pleanty of laughs within this game so it can keep you entertained and laughing.  I absolutely recommend this game.
Loovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it. Cuuu<3uuuuuuuuuuutttttttttteeeeeeee nnnnnneeekkooogirls
I love it its really fun and its a good way to pass time if you like kawaii things i also recommend this game :3
I LIKE THE GAME ITS MAKE ME LAUGH AND I LIKE TO SEE THE CATGIRLS, THEY SO CUTE <3
Cute catgirls, what is there not to like? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
cuteness inside 2 catgirls in 1 story is too much for me (///v///) *exploding with cuteness of chocola n vanila*
58h when i write this and who know how much i will play it again :D It is a basic novel where u cant make actions.Just reading a story line that is main setted. But i must say: Story is ok,could be longer but yea i mean the game is still growing ^^ Its cute and >w< nyaaa full of beautifull nekos (catgirls) This game maked the word neko to a real world speak :D Nekos for lifüü <3 >o< nya *petting u* hehe :3   (uncut version supports hentai elements/sex scenes) It is ok for me but if u want something really to play and have fun this isnt for u.
Needs more Coconuts. Chocola and Vanilla sucks.  Great game tho.
A fluffy, kind of goofy, mostly slice of life style story about catgirls. If that's the sort of thing you enjoy, then you'll love this game, If you're not a fan of that sort of thing, this probably won't change any opinions.
Have not started the second volume but this one was totally amazing. The H patch made it even better to XD 10/10
I now respect myself significantly lesser....
After the scathing (and deserved) review of Fault, I'm shocked you didn't even comment on how horrible the translation was. Does Sekai Project even have anybody who understands English look over these things? It's clear that their Japanese is poor, but I have no idea why the English is also so bad :narumi:  The fact that it's ambitious enough to get a simultaneous English release makes it worth checking out.  As for the adult content, I still find amazing the violence can get in relatively unimpeded, but when it comes to sexual content, everyone loses their head and it's completely okay to censor.
End My Life...
i love it
Great game, thank you nobel/lost pause for getting me into this!!
Made Vanilla and Chocola cream - filled! *If you know what i mean :D 10 R18 PATCHES/10
I love this game, Its too adorable for words. Its a nice little story and the characters are likeable.  This is my "In case of bad day, Break Glass" game, because it always leaves me with a grin on my face. My best recommendation is "If you can laugh along with it, give it a go"  9/10 will be a 10/10 when i can date Cinnamon. (Booby Cat is best girl)
H patch
I thought this would be about science...
Nyaaww Nyaaww Nyaaawww
it good
If you like sexy cat girls look no further.  Much better with the "Full Content Patch installed"  Game is kind of Short but the Artwork is great!! Sound 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Value5/10 Gameplay: N/a
my friend doesnt like this game because it reminds him of two roleplayers from a chat he used to frequent according to him chocola and vanilla are exactly like their characters
i want to pet them all so much they are so kawaii
i have nothing to say.....
10/10 Would recommend:  - Mother - Sister - Cousin - Childhood Friend - That Tsundere Girl
for anyone that is expecting a 18+ game please just buy it online and not trough steam. it build up to the 18 plus parts and then just cuts it out and fast forwards you to the part when you are done. great story but I m just going to buy the full game somewhere else. story is fun tho lol
Welcome to the reason why you wont go out anymore
I have to play this game with headphones on. Also I wouldn't buy any pastries from the MC's bakery, just saying....  EDIT: I'm a little farther up in the game and all I can say is the MC is too much. He finished 5 times in one session. 5 Times!!!  I finished in a fraction of the time the MC did
Why aren't you playing this game already it's fantastic, the animations are great and the characters well beyond cute. This game is well beyond worth playing and has a patch to remove censorship
Buy it. No balls.
-Buy the game -Play for 20 minutes -Download and install patch -(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   10/10 Overwhelmingly Positive
I don't know when or how I got this game but it was probably from one of the weeaboo retards that I talk to.   Help me.
I completed this.. dunno if I should be admitting that or not, but I had no internet, and wanted anime, but settled for this. After about 3 hours I got to the end. I recommend this if you like VN's otherwise walk away right now, because CatGirls wanting to have sex with you will happen 2 hours in.
Good Game~!
Well to say, I don't really think it's worth for those that aren't into anime/nekos/Visual Novels. For me it was enjoyable. Also remember to download 18+ version patch and make sure nobody is around, especially if you aren't a headphone user or somethin'  In short buy for nekos and just enjoy, remember to download the 18+ version while you are at it.
I wish real life had a "p" button.
Any game with two kawaii nekogirls deserves 10/10.
I dont know if there's an R18 patch....               gimme dat
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a visual novel about uh....Nekos x). The story is about Kashou, who has always wanted to be a western ''pâtissier''. He decided to work his own way to manage his bakery named ''La soleil pâtisserie''. However, arriving at his bakery, he found 2 of his old cat friends - Chocola and Vanilla. At first He tried to make them leave, but soon after, he knew that he was actually forced to accept them to work together with him. You will see how they are going to co-operate and develop their relationships between them little by little, following the story.   This one is quite exclusive and different from the other VNs with its ''E-mote'' system, which adds movements and changes to their attitudes and gests during the dialogue, even without clicking it. Which is almost a perfect combination with those cute catgirls since it makes them even more attractive. [spoiler]Notice that there are quite some sexual themes in the original version of this VN, you can still enable it on steam by an add-on system; albeit I still recommend you to play this VN with a feeling of ''pure'' love, not that kind of ''feeling''.[/spoiler]  Positive remarks +E-mote which makes this game more lively +dynamic and romantic soundtracks  +very well-designed graphics +actually appropriate for all ages if you play the steam version +a different genre of characters- cats!^^  Negative remarks -the R18 version (or positive for ''some'' players) -a little too short
Cute :3
I mean the visuals were stunning adn that was about it.    Its a VN without choice and so less of a game than just a story.  And well the story is pretty crappy.  The characters are stock and unengaging, the plot is non existant, and there are just far better things to do with your time.  I wouldn't bother to buy it unless it was on sale and you just want the art. Cuz there isn't much else here.
Well having just finished this game I think it's time to write my review Alright so obviously if you're purchasing this game, the only thing you legitimately care about is shagging these (probably underage) Cat girls. The first sex scene comes up at around the middle point of the game. Before that, there's allot of story which ended up negatively impacting my sexy time experience. Why is this you may ask? Simply put, the story and dialogue made me go from seeing these girls as nothing more than sexual objects for me to unleash my heavy load into, to seeing them more as my own daughters. So therefore, when it came to the sex scenes, i felt like I was nailing my own daughters which btw, I'm not fond of since i'm not american. The second sex scene comes at the end of the game and then thats it. They're alright I guess but they're kind of boring. If you're buying this game just for the hentai (so basically, if you're buying the game) You're probably better off just looking for the naughty pictures online and having a five knuckle shuffle over these girls that you have no connection to, rather than growing attached to them and then feeling like you're breaking 57 laws by destroying the insides of your daughters.  OVERALL: This game is worthless without the hentai patch and even with it, it's still not that good. I only purchased because it was on sale for like 80% off. Had I known how less than average this game would have been, I'm not sure I would have even bought it for a price even that low. Basically, If its the sex scenes you're looking for, just find them online. If it's the story you're interested in, Don't bother, it's garbage. If you're looking to unleash every drop of your juices in girls who are basically your daughters, then this game is a must have!
Install uncensored patch ----> PROFIT
I feel like I'd watched a long movie rather than playing a game... But it'd done good and didn't disappoint me.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU'RE NEKO LOVERS EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T COME TO THIS GAME FOR H-SCENE. . . . . . . . . or maybe you did.
I launched this game once and my entire friend list had to bug me about it.
Had been wanting this game for a while, and was lucky enough to have it bought for me for my birthday by my younger brother (not to make this sound more concerning).  After playing the teaser game Vol. 0 I was a little sceptical about the value for money in this instalment- had I paid for it myself at full price I might have been a little disappointed. Waiting for the sales is what you want to go for here.  Don't get me wrong- the game is beautifully made, probably one of the best well put together linear VNs I have played to date, the artwork is gorgeous and the character movement is fluid and natural (Ahem, apart from the balloonified chests of most of the characters). The music is cute and quirky, and the reading speeds for autoplay can be tweaked and saved for a relaxing smooth experience. 10/10 for aesthetics on this game.  Now for my criticisms, (Or more positives, depending on what you look for in a game I suppose, who am I to judge?)- the main running story is cute, set in a bakery that is in it's first few weeks of opening... yada yada.... Not much ACTUALLY happens in terms of storyline. It's definitely more of a slice of life thing going on- though a majority of the text in the game is repeated over and over throughout the entire thing. It's all so samey- teary eyed cat girls "Master.... Master....". I enjoyed the final chapter- as this was the only one that seemed to explore different behaviours and emotions from the main characters, all the rest are sadly quite bland.  Secondly, as others have pointed out- the way the relationships between the main characters are explicitly portrayed was a little disheartening. I feel it would have had so much more effect if more had been left to the imagination- Spoiler alert- [spoiler] At one point in the story the catgirls stop being coy and outright express their desire "to have sex with master"	[/spoiler] , it just saps all of the flittery tension that these novels are enjoyable for. I get that this is about fanservice, and that is WHY people are playing the game, but I dunno. Putting it there in black and white takes away the curiosity of what's actually going on.   Another point- leading on from this... The player character explicitly mentions several times that he sees these two AS HIS CHILDREN. It's a little unnerving- i'm no newbie to bizarre ecchi, but even I think this is pushing the boundaries a little. "As pets, no... family. Even lovers" are not words that should be put together like that. This is all made even more cringeworthy from the fact we know the two girls are somewhere around 6 months of age, obviously growing far faster than normal humans- though by the time they are going through their heat they still act relatively innocent as a child would... Each boundary here (Pets/kids/family) has been pushed a little too far out of the comfort zones to create a weird blend of "Um... is it even okay for me to be reading this?" kind of thing.  Final notes: + Great art/ animation/ music + Good set of attainable achievements + Adorable characters with strong personalities - Weak backstory - Weird almost forced relationships - Repetitive  8/10, would Meow again
Their boobs were too small and jiggled too much for such small boobs.   Unrealistic but sexy, 6/10
it was an accident, i swear
I bought it only to uncensor it. oppai/10 to disappoint everyone I know.  After an hour, I don't regret anything so far. 10 hours passed, Man this is really great content. I must go over this story more in detail.
why are you even looking for a reason not to play game? just do it !  buy this game now!  Cause you will hate yourself best game ever 100/10
Best game NA
Do I like this game?  Sure  Would I recommend it to friends and family?  [b][i]Well...[/i][/b]
people meme gifted it to me as well as volume 2 and volume 0  10/10 buckets of fresh cream being washed off of catgirls in the shower
Mom asked where my money went, i showed her this. I`m an orphan now.
This game is a perfect example of what paradise looks like, and it is beautiful and full of cat ears.
I can never look at cats the same way again
Really addict game  very love this XD
10/10 would press p again
420/69 broke my P button while playing
This is a game I would play all day if I were to not be playing Sakura Spirit all day. Has cats, girls, cakes, and philosophy between what is a cat and what is a human.  [spoiler] You also get to fuck the cats, nice [/spoiler]  10/10 Anime Steam Sale was a big success.
Nyan Nyan~    10/10 would recommend.
go download and patch the 18+ patch this will make the game more awesome.
So, my friend gave this to me as a "joke-gift" congratulating me for my newly aquired gal, i got so into thje story i didn't had the time to fap. 10/10 game of the year i cried gg wp-------------------UPDATE:: I broke up with my gf u swer i'm not trying to be funny, i really did.

I Love this game  Have a Good Character and Art   And sound track  9/10
It's a great survival horror, when you're not being viciously assualted by the Cat Human Hybrid Mutants you're being tormented and emotionally abused by them. This game is hard for new players to get into, it has many advanced mechanics and follows a very emotional, dark and horrific underlying plot.  A recap of my experience with the game: -Moved into a new house to start my business. -Weird things start happening on the first day, two of the boxes in the house begin to move on their own. -Two Cat Human Hybrid Mutants leap out of the boxes when I open them. -Absolutely Terrified. -They feign friendliness after failing their intial suprise attack. -Young possessed girl claiming to be my sister brings more Mutants to my dwelling. -A few days pass without incident. -Out of the blue. my eyes are assualted by their true form. -Saved game and hid under the covers of my bed quivering in fear. -The next day I played and things seem okay. Then I'm assualted during that night by the Mutants. -Alt+F4  If you love Psychological Survival Horror games I completely recommend this game to you. This game is NOT for the faint of heart or easily scared.
catgirls √ polygamy √ questionable bestiality √ incest and or pedofelia no but dam close   anyone who plays this game is a heathen and i'm no better.   i played threw with the "steam cleaned" verson but anyone with a little know how can fix that [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647450086]:cough:[/url] however i will say out of the few VNs ive played it has been the best put togeather. the animations are really polished and quite impressive honestly. its a very cute story with very cute cat girls.
Dude dogs are better
Even though it has sexually explicit images everywhere and borderline pedophilia is implied constantly, I can't get my dick hard because of sheer panic that FBI might be watching me play it.
No waifu no laifu  10/10  EDIT: When I reached 1000 hours some days ago,           I showed this game (with H-Patch) to my father.           He couldn't understand how I could play this game for 1000 hours.           I said: Because I love nekos. (Still a better love story than Twilight)
Better Play If you are home alone
probably the only puss puss i'll ever get
OOOOOOOHHHHHHH YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Friend gave me this for my birthday. Now I want to hang myself. My friends don't judge me luckly, they already knew I was insane Thank god all the hentai wasn't in it. (I was forced to play) (There is a patch appearently to see the lewd stuff)
I've become something I never expected, a cat loving weeaboo. There is no light in my soul anymore. good game.
i lock myself in my room ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
My family and friends have now disowned me, but at least I've got my catgirls.
I was hoping this would be a visual novel that you have choices. It is not, you literally just sit and watch a really slow visual Novel with zero interaction.
10/10- Would get slapped about twenty times again
Nothing like stuffiing cream inside Vanilla's and Chocola's pie.    10/10 Would become a chef.
It is more than its thematic turbulence that makes NEKOPARA Vol. 1 extraordinary, actually. Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Neko Paradise and back home with Shigure, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice. Overall nice cheap porn - 9/11
My parents have never been more disappointed in me
10/10 would nosebleed again
Gave me cancer 10/10 will play again
Got a few friends one night and offered them a game of this until they got bored: How it went down: Friend 1: Started furiously masturbating until I had to cut his entire arm off. Friend 2: Sat down and said "You sir have no life". Friend 3: Got upto the 1st neko sex scene  and said FUCK THIS SHIT IM OUT!  Me: Happily played until the end and had trouble getting the secret achivement. 11/10 IGN Best game to fap to.
best gaem, cute cahracter, nice plot
AWEEEEEEEEEEEEEESOME!!!!!!!!!
Super kawaii cat girls and a "chest bounciness" slider?! Throw all the "plot" into the mix and I think we have ourselves a cure for depression!  BUGS/CRASHES: I encountered a bug in this game that causes it to crash if you press SHIFT + TAB while playing it. Haven't found a way to remove the bug but it only triggers if you press those two buttons. Just don't do that and the game works fine. The bug doesn't stop you from getting achievments/cards and other combinations like ALT + TAB(you'll probably need that a lot with this game!) still work.
Played it over and over again untill all my cs go friends unfriended me <3
Definitely not a game for animal rights activists.
nc eroge XD
I was actually very annoyed to discover there were NO CHOICES you could make during this "game". probably the first tagged "dating sim" i've ever seen without them letting you make choices. It's just a visual novel without choices. very irritated at this as it wasn't made more clear.
There's actually plot, the cute neko girls are just a bonus.
it's two cute i got the diabetuse save your self 10\10 would press p again
I don't know why this game gets so good reviews. What's a game with no choices? Sorry but I'm not very entertained but just reading and clicking.
Tissue Paper Simulator with the R18 Patch
Well to be honest, i don't really have too much hope from this game at the beginning. but after i play, it changed my opinion about this game.  10/10 would recomend this
I do Not Regret getting This game. It is an Absolute must have for the Single and the Open minded...With a nice blendy storyline and CG that would make an athiest believe....i must say this cash i spent(reluctantly at the time) was well worth it. PPS- Enjoy the magic to come, our MC is a very Busy man............
the 18+ patch.....wow
Another very impressive Visual Novel by NEKO WORKs as always. Nekopara will never get old and will always remain great and amazing due to the art always being well done and the voices and text also being very well done. Overall i highly recommend this to any person and neko lovers out there.
Unfortunately steam only sells you like half a game. The hentai scenes make up like half the game. Luckily there's a patch so you can play the full game. Let yourself go. It's ok. Let it overtake you. Give in. You know you want to. Play the Fucking game. 10/10 Would play again
10/10 would bang
yes
Amazing!
vaery good this is fun to play and has good story
I gotta admit, I bought the game just for the memes but it's extremely well made and has a decent story.   10/10 would disappoint my parents again.
Can't face my mom anymore after she saw me playing this game  10/10
cured my depression
Personally, I didn't think I would like the game after I first read the plot, but I do.  I was kind of thinkig about trying it sometime anyway and my friend who didn't play it just suggested it because most of my friends know I love cat girls so that kind of gave me a reason to just think screw it and buy it.  I'm glad I did. This game really funny and cute at the same time.  I'm kind of mad that the game is 55% off two weeks after I bought it at full price but I did already finish it this past Friday and it was well worth the orignal $9.99.  I wish steam had the adult version because it still obvious where some deleated stuff fits in, but it's good either way and you cna always try to convert your stea version or just buy the 18+ later.      My personal opinion: This is not all ages even though it's meant for it.  All the sexual suggestions are still here.
This game made my computer overheat.  10/10
For the love of catgurlz! Buy this game!
[h1] [15 minute gameplay review]	 [/h1]  On sale. Overwhelming positive review of this game. Cute girls. This is what makes me encouraged to stop play Payday 2 for awhile and buy then play this game.  I gotta admit, I hate cat ears and squeeky high pitch voice. But once the box opened at the intro scene was opened, them they're kawaii af.  So far so good. Will update this review more.
A lot of cat-girls   10/10
Another collection for cat f*ucking simulator, great
its GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUD
I think I just played a kinetic VN about people who wish cats behaved more like dogs, but also wore waitress uniforms.  And were legal.  Great for wish fulfillment and cute dog behavior presented as cat behavior.  Not great if you're looking for a visual novel with any decent meaning or depth.  This game has been deemed 20% furry.  Recommended only because the VN doesn't really advertise itself as anything but exactly what it is.
69/10 gotta love me some catgirls  -pros catgirls boobs panties nyaa boobs maid outfits  -cons who the fuck put this guy in here gtfo steam version is censored (go get the r18 patch)
When I first came upon this mysterious gem, I was bewieldered !  I simply could not comprehend this illustrious garden of good fortune. I merely scoffed at it, but then, in a golden oppurtunity which now I hold and compare to something such as the discorery journey that discovering jesus is. I engaged the game in a fit and soon grew accustomed to it's heavenly allure.  I hencely adopted my own slave cat girl and quickly set her to work.  I then beganto scheme a way to weasle my way into their furry little feline hearts. With persistance and clever wits I seduced each primal temptress and had their hearts in chains of love, not unlike the chains I held them captive with. We then proceeded to acts of such primal nature that describing it is almost impossible. I thrusted the first cat bitch on the ground and tore off her cute little cat dress. I quickly tore it off in a swipe and left her, belly side up, defenseless. A cat never lets you stroke her belly, and you could imagine how a cat woman would react to a similar attempt. She cowled and shrieked and at that moment really did sound like a primal house cat. I held them by the backs of their necks and centered their pussies. I tore their insides asunder.
Don't forget the patch ;)
9/11 best game
love catgirls would stick it in them im such a furry haha lol xDDDD :)) oh man i need to take a shower after playing this haha :)) (if u know what i mean lol xDD) anyway i recommend is very good kawaii nekos ! ^-^ i love :DD and they hot haha :DDDDDDD ;)
Needs a patch to work properly, otherwise excellent.
booby bouncies .. i rate .. RAGE BONER /10
With the magic of technology, you can now fulfill your inner desire to fuck your cats! Without the whole pesky prison thing.  Freud would have a field day with this.
Good for people who are peverts and anime lovers
cat
this is the best game I have ever played! 101/10 visuals. I feel like i'd need quad titan x's to run this but I dont! perfect optimisation, and balanced multiplayer. If you have to choose between this and fallout 4, choose this. better story and gameplay
Just finished the game and just have to say I highly recommend this game, it's awesome, it's fun and cheerful.  The game art is really nice to look at and is well drawn.  Nekopara has very cute characters that you fall in love with, their seiyuu have really cute voices and have done a great job.  Story wise, it's very simple and doesn't take long to finish the game, it took me about 11 hours at a normal pace, so you should be expecting anything between 9 to 11 hours.  Best game on Steam.  Now! Time to play Vol 0 and Vol 2!
My friend gifted me this game and he said that if I banged at least one of the furries then I wouldn't have to pay him back $5.  I'm a poor frick, so let's just get started.  There's no real gameplay to the game.  The only thing you actually do is listen to dialogue.  In fact, this is basically just your average TV Anime Hentai Show where you click on demand.  Why did you do this to me, Devon.  Why?
Sold a CSGO skin for this game, 10/10 worth it.
very nice game so many cat-astrophes, hehehe.
He said they were like daughters to him. Like Daughters.
I love it XD I love nekos XD
download the patch you wont regret it. You'll only receive disappointment glares from your parents
Good for wasting time  Pros : - Nice artwork, CGs - Nice storyline  Cons : - Need more sequels
Just sitting here playing this light novel when i discovered the best button in this game.  Pressing P was one of the most satisfying feelings i've had while playing a light novel.  Especially whenever Coconut or Cinnamon made an apperance.  10/10 would Push P again.
just no no man dont do it lol #1 its censored #2 its not fun #3 i sure hope you like to read i mean it is a visual NOVEL there is no interactivity with this game what so ever other than pressing P on the keyboard to make the cat shake. thats it thats the game look at a picture of a cat girl and scroll through hours of rediculous text not even worth reading.
Great story. Cute catgirls. Adorable voice acting. Just be sure to make sure you're alone during Chapters 5 and 6. Though, I wish there was more... (Still 20/10)
This game is heaven for me it is the best
its absolutly redecules this game has no story just playing with haream ,boobs,having s*x, and pooring dialog to read every time .
Love This game :3
It's... so beautiful and moe! And There's Vol 0 and 2 as well!! Incredible! A brilliant quote from the game: "Absolutely honest goodwill with no mind games. I guess that's what made catgirls so wonderful." -Kashou (Vol 1)
I'd rate this VN a solid 11/10 solely for the implementation of the 'P' button. Makes the game interactive :D  Solid storytelling, Fluid character movements that seem realistic, and Interactive. Certainly one of the best VN's I'v played.  Would highly recommend for Casual VN lovers who love catgirls !
The cat girls were cute, but the developers overdid the "childlike innocence" and instead it came across as the cat girls literally having the mind of an 8 year old. Unless you are a pedophile, that's most likely not a turn on. I personally wasn't particularly interested in the sex parts and thought it would be cool to play it for the story as the cat girls were adorable and the art style is very beautiful. Sadly, the story sucks and is bland, there is nothing really going on.  Spoilers: You are a guy opening up a cafe, your sister's 2 cat girls mailed themselves to your cafe, you end up setting them up with their own room. You go shopping together and do mundane boring things as well as eat takoyaki while the cat girls act like children. It is really very boring and given that this eventually wanted to lead to sexual stuff, I think they made it very unappealing. Even as a porno this fails because you would have to scroll through huge walls of text to get to any sex parts.  If you like boring visual novels with girlchildren "love interests" and no plot, sure, you'll love it. If you were expecting some kind of story? Nah.  Not worth the money.
Press P, magic happens.  10/10
Could possibly be the highlight of my life.
10/10 still wants a catpanion
Not a game, but more of a visual novel, and a must if you're into story, romance, anime, and cute scenes.
No.
This is literally the most autistic game I have ever played next to trap simulator { Highschool Romance }, would buy as gag gift again
-Downloaded 18+ patch -Decided to stream to friends -Hears Clapping noises during Chocola scene -Assumes fapping is done 10/10 Game Best stream ever
good game
Nekopara is one of those feel good games (and I'm not just talking about the sex). The plot is very basic, so it's more about the interactions and conversations the main character has with the cat girls. Every moment is an opportunity for the cat girls to act cute, say cute things, and do cute things.  The graphics are beyond par for this type of game, with incredibly beautiful visuals and details, and impressively animated using Live2D. The vast array of gorgeously frilly lolita inspired clothing will make you constantly fawn over how adorable Chocola and Vanilla look. The character voices are also very good. It's a bit on the trope-y side, but it helps tying it all together in a comfortable familiarity. You'll quickly find your favorite character.  Since this is the first volume, a fair bit of the first few chapters deals with setting the stage, and introducing you to the personalities of all the characters. The "plot" doesn't really "pick up" until about half-way through.  One thing I do like about this particular game is the small attention to detail that they've designed. Things like automatically moving the mouse cursor to the center when selecting yes/no for loading/saving. The user interface is intuitive, and the colors are welcoming.  In terms of gameplay, there really is none. It's a non-interactive, visual novel. Don't expect more than that. That's not to say it's a bad thing. It's just to be expected for this kind of game.  If you're thinking about purchasing this game for the sex, you will be disappointed to know that Steam has made the developer completely cut the sexual content. And relatively speaking, that's about 40% of the game! Fortunately, if you google it, you can find an easy to install patch that will restore all the content. So at the very least, buy this game to support the developer!
Greatest vidyar gam of all tim very nice
shut up and take my money
Tbh I was expecting a more story based visual novel so I was a little disappointed when I bought it but after playing it a few hours I ended up enjoying it as the game is alluring and charming (Arts, animation, interfaces are pretty good).  Appart from that if you know what to expect you will enjoy your time with cute catpanions :3
cats and shit 8/10
Really glad this game is on stream, it helped me discover the wonderful world of visual novels. There aren't any choices you can make but the art style and the overall cuteness really appeals to my love of anime. Good game overall.
Jerkin for your gerkin basically....
Why the fuck is this put as education?  Either way, found this in the recommended tab as "shooter". Kind of wish I was kidding but hey, this is the internet.  This game is pretty fucking funny when it comes to memes and honestly, after playing through it, I think this game is good for all ages,  10/10-IGN  Also, buy all the volumes. Sadly, I do not have vol.2 and I really regret it but, I know later I'll get it.   See me later in AnimeExpo when I dress up as one of the maids.  Im out, peace.
Beet game I have ever played
Set in an alternate timeline during the Cold War, the greatest minds of both Russia and Japan combined their knowledge to create a great superweapon in the hopes of destroying western culture. After years of tireless research and 10,000 Gulag prisoners the first catgirls are born. With the catgirls being intergrated into their society western civilizations surrender to their Russian overlords with the promise of an endless supply of catgirls.  The game begins 40 years after these events and now catgirls outnumber the humans with many families owning several catgirls and the majority roaming the streets.You play as Kashou the prototype in a line of Russian bakery robots assinged to a family who own 6 catgirls. Watch him find and lose his humanity as he attempts to manoeuvre the harsh political landscape that is the cat paradise.
1000 % neko <3
god, what am i doing
I can't, in good conscience, say anything good about this. Unless you're a fan, or at least can bear, with nichijou types of anime, maybe Nekopara is for you. If not, spend that money on some other VN out there.
Can adjust chest bounciness 10/10 would fap again.
I regret everything.
where 2 cop nude mods  oops, I thought this was google search
Cats, Cats, and Cats. What else can you ask for?
This is a good game.
Not my style of gaming. Thought I was gonna be able to make choices. I felt like I was watching a movie.
Quality game 10x better than dota/csgo/smite/dark souls/arma
soviet extermination camp simulator 4/10.
fucking lukewarm tea
Khajiit is sad  Khajiit need vol.2
Nekos... 10/10 Heavily recommend
cat grills 10/10
Nekopara is a god tier eroge chocola is my waifu and best girl buy it now
Hentai simulator: Neko warfare
Nekopara Volume 1 was a wonderful experience that took me on a journey that toyed with ALL of my senses. From the amazing art, which consisted of girls with skin so shiny and eyes so large i thought they were statues made from baby foreskin with vagarinos for eyes, which just so happens to throughly arouse me. With varied characters like some slutto who only spoke in 3rd person and sounded like a dolphin with down syndrome to the oldest who looks like a fucking 11 yearold hermafrodite. My personal favorite character was my sister, who i was dissapointed with because i could not cram my crystal halberd into her Gaping Dragon. Also, the cats all want the dingaling from you but apparently they are like 7 months old or some shit. No dialouge choices made me feel like I could have gotten just as interesting of an experience if I wanted to go watch a Holocaust documentary. Also why the fuck am I so buff. I am a fucking baker in this game, why do I look like Ryan Gosling had a homosexual baby with young Danny Devito. If I am that buff I should be a model. I must have like a less attractive Steven Hawking face in order for me to choose to be a fucking baker with that kind of a body. Fuck this game. Please. 11/10, not enough cat badonkadonks. Also, i want some cat futa or traps or something. fukC Me Daddy.
Sure, the catgirls are cuties, but it becomes awkward and sleazy halfway through, ended up as perverted as you can expect from a VN (As I'm sure you could've guessed from the other reviews). Don't bother buying if you were just hoping for cute catgirls but aren't into Hentai.  Cute character designs and really great animation though, haven't seen another VN that could compete  Another upside: Cards of about €0,25 and an easy way to get 100% badges for that E-peen bonus
This game changed my life. I met this girl who was always by my side; providing me with black-up when i need it. We always had fun together. This one time, i took her and her friend to this ammusment park and we went on a freefall ride and i got us some free ballons too. By this time, i shut off my game and i was back to being alone ; - ;  11/6- Gave me my 6 hours of happiness
The steam version is 'Benny Hill' level fanservice... short skirts, bouncing boobs and not much of anything else. Still it is what it is and its done reasonably well. Skims over anything really heavy as far as plot goes. A bit of fun fluff.  The 18+ version really doesn’t do much more either. The next one in series is a little more heavy especially the 18+ version
how do we get uncencored version???
2 nukes were not enough.
10/10 would play again
Catgirls ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Words cannot describe the goodness of this game <3, neko4lyfe
Well... I like this game.... so interesting.... Harem....lawl... I finished this game and achievements... lawl lawl lawl....                                                                           I like elephants....
Hell Yeah
[b]Proved to my best friend that I am a man too ...  Now he doesn't make eye contact with me while in public ...  So I convinced him to buy the game ...  Now no one makes eye contact with us at all.  10/10 would lose touch with humanity again.[/b]
Are you bored with all those military shooters? Did your girlfriend dump you? If you answered "Yes" on both questions, this game is for you!  But wait, there's more!  If you have no one to sleep with, this is definitely your all-in-one package to heaven!
%%%%%%%%%
do it for the "plot"
A true fap session 11/10
You know why ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nyan ^~^
Top kek, kinda boring tho, too much talking not enough action.
I'm glad I got this game for cheap otherwise I would have been truly upset to pay full price for a game that took me 4.6 hours to beat. Besides the fact that its a very short game I have to say it was still ok.
"10/10 Best game ever made" - IGNekopara
If you buy this and play without the "Single-handed-only" patch installed, then you are weak and you should be ashamed of yourself.
My parents disowned me.
Are you sure this is not a First-Person Shooter? 11/10 would rate this is a FPS (If ya know what I mean)
Good game
A Game about a world were they created Genetic Hybrid Catgirls that look like Children so you can fuck them.  Great Game.  Very Japan.  It's very Charming.  Hints at Incest too.  I heard there's a 18+ Version as well.  Pressing P makes their Boobs Jiggle.  [spoiler]I Highly Recommend[/spoiler]
More than just the... Lewd aspects of this game, it creates a wonderful happy story, that just makes everything better and cheerful. Beyond the parts that you would rather have no-one around to see, this is a game (Yes, I know, technically a visual novel) that has the ability to "cure depression", as it were, with the fluffy and happy story that is featured. Amazing art, adorable character, good story. A game I will definitely come back to when I am feeling sad and need a pick-me-up.
Now with just a single click of a mouse, all of my friends can see when I'm masturbating and what I'm masturbating to.  10/10
Correct way to play Nekopara -Launch the game -Grab tissues and lotion -Get caught by your parents -Dissapoint your parents -Get sent to camp -Talk about Nekopara at camp -Get molested by your camp advisor  [h1] [b] 10/10 would get molested again [/b]
There will be never enough games with sweet catgirls <333 10/10 better play with mods.
cat paradise indeed
In one word: What can keeps you from playing with such lovely cat girls? No way. Just buy it and enjoy your fun time playing with Chocolat and Vanilla~  The advanced E-mote system lets Chocolat and Vanilla looks more lively and lovely. And thanks to the CV contributing such cute voice for them.  And you can also add some, hmm, [strike]exciting[/strike] contents in the game, find it using your internet.[spoiler]Or ask a Chinese friend to help you get it if you feel confused reading Chinese comments.[/spoiler] Download, overwrite directory,prepare your tissues, have fun~  10/10 recommend√  一句话概括的话：萌即是正义√  Sa姐作品，国人画师，画风良心，cv激萌，还自带中文字幕，你问我吼不吼那？当然吼那！ 即使不谈国人情怀，看到这样可爱的猫娘还有这样良心的价格为什么不买买买那√ 即使抛开完全体是个日常向[spoiler][strike]啪啪啪[/strike][/spoiler]游戏不谈，猫娘们也真的卡哇伊，有些天然呆还有些天然萌的猫猫们陪你度过一天忙碌之后，给你轻松愉快的时光。而且本作中以E-mote技术加入的动态表情也让人物看起来更加生动。[u]虽然说人物立绘中加入表情动作等等已经不是第一次出现在galgame之中了，不过能够像这样生动的应该还是比较少或者说是第一个把。[/u][spoiler]而且打补丁之后还有各种真·福利我会说么(手动斜眼[/spoiler] [spoiler]所以说玩这种游戏之前一定要看评论区的说，隐藏在玩家之中的老司机们全天候24小时不间断轮流发车(手动斜眼，记得准备好你的乘车卡[strike]手帕纸[/strike][/spoiler]  10/10满分好评√
What could you ask better than a world filled with Cat Girls and this is just the first volume. Looking foward to the 2nd volume as well.
I'm sorry to say that the game is boring. I've tried to give it a chance but the characters are very stereotypical and, to be honest, shallow and predictable. The story line is the same unfortunately. I have very little motivation to finish the story. If My Heart Had Wings is on another level compared to this game.  Edit: After finishing the game I can still say it was boring. Sure it had a few good moments but the Steam version of this game is basically a porn game without the porn.
More like reading a e-book so far, but it is a surely moving game.
amazing. just absolutely amazing. 10/10 game.
decent storyline, nothing special. You would think from the display pictures that there would be arcs for many different girls but as it turns out its simply chocola and vanilla only >.<  glad they added more for vol. 2.  If you downloaded the H patch, the sound effects are god awful (resembling the sound one gets from flusshing a clogged toilet.  4/10, would not recommend.
Hentai patch makes everything better.
My 'p' key is broken 10/10
Its very Cute and i love it :3
10 bucks of pure what am I doing with my life.  10/10 Would be silently judged by my family again.
The more you play, the harder it gets. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
what the fuck
11/10 would fuck a cat again
http://youtu.be/01wZ4qXmAmA  I made the mistake of mentioning this game in a Skype call and my friend bought it for me.  I'm not fond of my friends.  Bonus Video: http://youtu.be/jngxsGFQYQg
its utter garbage but at least the protagonist isnt a fuckboy also you need to pay double if you want to just uncensor the incestuous catgirls on your screen having this on steam is basically having citrus in barnes & noble 10/10
If you buy this game and expect to be disgusted with yourself, you won't be dissapointed.
this game is good       [spoiler] shigure is really fucking creepy though [/spoiler]
schlick schlurge schloock
meow meow meow short visual novel game and i like cat girl characters        Vanilla  Chocolate   Milk  Coconot
You have to do it for her guys. It could cause health problems if you don't! Don't worry Vanilla will help you with that pusspuss.  ItsOkay/10
IN CAT FUCKERS VOLUME 1 YOU PLAY AS CATFUCKER  WHAT DOES HE DO  HE RUNS A CAFE  FUCKS CATS  MAKES COFFEE  FUCKS CATS  MAKES PASTRIES  FUCKS CATS  CLEANS UP AFTER CLOSING TIME  FUCKS CATS  WHAT WILL HE DO IN VOLUME 2???????????????????????  2 B CUM
I sunk over 30 hours. It has cute catgirls. There is a booby-bounce meter. What other proof do you need that this is gold?
nice
Don't forget the hentai patch  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Really good game  Installed the patch and tried the no-fap challenge Needless to say it was Hard. 69/10  Vanilla best grill
This is not a game it's a click simulator with bo*bs.
Buy All the Series from Vol 0, 1, and 2  damn i must be so pervert :3 i hope there is still another volumes LOL
First and foremost, this game is strictly 18+ so the rest of the review will assume you are aware of that fact and are ok with it  Nekopara Vol. 1 is a simple Visual Novel where you follow the adventures of kashou and his attempts to make his living running a bakery, but there's a surprise in store for him once he starts unboxing in his new home 2 Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla   The story itself is good enough, I give it a 3.5/5 character development is poor but it has plenty of humor combine with serious moments  But I'm sure if you're looking to buy this game it's for the 18+ content There is a patch avalible on the internet (I just googled Nekopara 1 patch and it was the first result) It add explicit sexual scenes into the game at certain points, they involve the main character(you) having sex with the 2 mentioned cargirls so if you want to play the game with the patches I suggest playing at night, and always be ready to switch to something more normal, like pornhub  The artwork is pretty nice, a solid 4.5/5 for me, I would of liked something that involved a couple of darker colors as well as the light ones common through the game, but that's just a personal preference  In Summary, if you want something only cost a couple bucks and you can use for fapping then this is a easy choice, though I beg you to keep the volume down at certain parts
Its fun I love the cat girls and to boot they are the cutest when they try to make their master happiest. Play as much and enjoy the cute and playful story even if it is short.
I was never here...  10/10
What did I just play xD Honestly it's what you'd expect from eroge. Simple as that xD
A great game, i feel not alone as much. I'm accompanied by those cats presence makes me feel better.  You know like jerk off and watch the boobs bounce and stuff yeah good stuff.
nice game
The plot in this game is great.
My co-worker saw me playing this at my workplace and said "What the hell?" I gave him one copy and told him to "Have fun" with a smirking smile. I haven't seen him since then.  10/10 would ruin other people's life again.
ネコたちは愛、ネコたちは生活。 Catgirls are love, Catgirls are life.  悲しむ事が無い。 "... I have no regrets"
God is dead and we killed him.
What am I doing with my life.
Enjoy the catgirls. They are the ultimate in adorbs.  The story is decent, and there is plenty of hilarity.
The only game I have ever played that includes a walk of shame to bed afterwards.
Im more of a dog person
Nekopara Vol 1  The Nekopara series is a wonderful series where its a world of humenoid modified catgirls were they are either pets, partners, or companions, some work as emplyees in the stores of there owners, or some are just friends to the owner or the family and or they can become a life partner to there owner.  The story is about a young man who decides to move out of his families house and start a new life and buiness by opening up a baking store, but it turns out that two of his families catgirls snuck in by hiding in some boxes and thats were the story begins. Thats all ill reveal of the story and plot.  The game is written very well full of funny moments and filled with some sad moments never to much of one type of drama they keep it very even and not repetitive I found myself laughing alot from the jokes and i also felt the feels when it was either a sad or seriouse moment.  The artwork in the game was done very well I love how the sprites have so much movement and such expressions within the game including the sound effects and voice over its a very good combination the devs have done with the game.  The music was composed very well it fits the mood of the situation within the game there is alot of songs within the game so it will not get to repetitive while you play the game.  I highly recommend this game if your a fan of anime,neko's,or just visual novel's this is one of the best vn's I have played in a good while I hope you all will enjoy the game as much as I have   ~Bloodwolf
I like the story (Best 8,5 Hours of my life) :3 EZ achievements (if you olny are afther that) :(  All the cat girls are so KAWAII!! 〵(｡^‿^｡) / But i only can get 1 of them then i want Maple (;︵;)
[h1]An actual serious review[/h1] This is the first visual novel purchased I've purchased on steam. The VN itself is very well presented (good VA, music, art). It should be noted that his release is toned down (i.e., H-related content was removed).  [b]What I liked[/b] - Music and Art - Characters are nicely constructed and their VAs are great. - Story was decent. There's not too much exposition which would pull you out of the flow of the story.  [b]What I disliked[/b] - Not a fan of the "imouto" which is almost oppresive with one of the characters. Just not my thing. - Maximum in-game resolution was 1600x900.  [b]Other notes[/b] - I quite enjoyed going through this VN. I'm very tempted to pick up Vol. 2 when it goes on sale.  - Vol. 1 is a passive VN. You just go from one panel to the next with no interaction with the content on-screen. Vol.0 and Vol. 2 are more interactive.  - VA is Japanese only.  - The eroge content has been removed, which requires [b]re-purchasing[/b] the game from the developer at it's true full price to obtain. The steam version is actually half-priced compared to the full-game due to content cuts. Purchase the steam version if you want access to the cards and achievements. Should you wish to have both, there are guides/posts in the community on getting the developer's full version to "patch" the steam version which will get you all game content and all steam content available. Vol. 2 actually has an official content patch that costs extra.
why am i collecting this game....  10/10 need more
I`ve played this game only for plot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
10/10! <3 chocola & vanilla <3
Dear Diary,   Jackpot.
There's a 'Chest Bounciness' slider setting. Enough said.  10/10
Yup...
"the neko translates to cat, while the para translates to i like to dissapoint my parents" 10/10
Cat girls ..... Recomended
This VN has made me realise that suicide is the only way off this shit planet.
Only $5 (on sale) to sell your friends and family away for catgirls? Well worth the money.
Cats are cute. Girls are cute. Catgirls are cute. Buy it.
Desu Desu Kawai                              BUY THIS! >:C
Does not Include Adult Scenes. but good on every other mark.
Somewhat good Visual Novel Story not very great but I think everyone will enjoy the story and not so many VN has animation character and the important things.. it's cut >,<
U should buy it now! much catgirls are waiting for your kindness :3
Catgirls
This guy who refers to himself as kashew decides he wants to be really anime one day. So after hopping himself up on some pain pills and alchohol he decides to pretend to own catgirls, and have close family ties as well. We all know the secret though, this game is just a lie and its really about a man lying to himself that getting buttsex from a cat can be romantic. Well its actually two cats.    Why would you even like catgirls?               Why do I own thiis.
This is not a good VN in my opinion, if you are interested in this then only grab it for the porn. As a VN i can't recommend this, there is no choices just sex and sex the end.
Soooooooooo good! Seriously. Buy.  Art is amazin  P buttom is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The voiceacting is pretty good too. 99/10 I buy it again.
nope, just nope. Even a powerpoint presentation is more action.  I guess I'm too old, too european, not enough into hentai (if that's what it's called) but IMO not worth the 3$   bought it after hearing about some streamers getting banned from twitch and wanted to know what's all the fuss about, what a let down.
You won't know how fun is it if you don't play it.
I like story on this game.. Looks so cute here :D
Do you ever find yourself wishing that you could have sexy time with a Catgirl? I know I do.
Not enough swimming

game of the year   10/10 IGN
BEST GAME IN WORLD 10/10 WOULD FAP TO LOLI NEKOS AGAIN
For cat and maid lover, it is the best visual novel game.  The games have simple stories but make grateful feeling.  If you want to watch service, you can patch 18+ on games. The patch is perfect. it added H scene, action and voice over.  For starter player, you can play NEKOPARA Vol. 1 > Vol. 0 > Vol. 2  Vol. 1 is introduce character and stories about Chocolate and Vanila Vol. 0 is stories about 1 day before Vol. 1 Vol. 2 is stories after open business and Coconut and Azuki  My score is 10/10
All the laws broken in this game -Human Trafficking -Slavery -Polygamy -Incest -Pedophilia  I also can't look at my cats the same anymore
Macro Simulator
fantastic fun for all ages nekos cute diabetes heart attacks fun
Vol.0 was good so i bought this one too
my girlfriend left me 10/10
*Found Catgirls in the Box*  My Reaction : Noice Best Game ever    *They are not Ready for the True Love*  My Reaction : Waiting for Nekopara Vol.2 to know if they change their Mind
Vanilla: "Pervert! Lecher! Horny pastry puffer!"  10/10 would puff pastries again
DO NOT PUT THIS GAME ON A USB STICK!!!! My friends made fun of me for having a "cat fucking game", out of protest I put a copy of the games on his USB stick. a week after I did this I went ill and that piece of s**t of a best friend played the fucking game infront of the class (we have a projecter in our classroom) I had the uncut patch My last save was insind Vanilla  I wore a mask for about a mounth after that  Still a good game thou
7/10  10/10 with R18 patch
NEKOPARA vol1 is a simple story of a young man who opens a bakery and is invaded by two of the catgirls (2 of 6) that his little sister has been raising - the catgirls are innocent little things with bouncy boobs and lascivious intentions, our young baker resists, but clearly he has no chance.  The squeals are real, and if you are looking for some mildly tittilating, Japanese visual-novel entertainment, then you won't do much better than this.
almost worse than boku no pico
Take my money and give us more nekopara!!
Really nice game with incredible artwork and likeable characters, a nice hartwarming story for those who like visual novels.
10 out of 10
its a very good visual novel i ever play because i relly love cat girls Nekopara is the best
This is the best galgame I ever played.
11/10 I finished this game in 2 days Whenever i see a cat, my mind keeps telling me not to do anything strange xD My parents are proud of me when they saw me playing this :D
My friends now think I'm in to the whole "beastialty" thing...   Welp, there goes my pride.   No regrets, though.
This visual novel is very nice  + Art, music and animations + voice acting + interesting heartwarming story + Nekooooos ... lots of neko cuteness  - cut version from the original R18 game ( + the price was reduced to compensate the cut content) - This is steam fault. - Now my friends think i'm a lost cause  edit: The story stand on its own, the R18 give it a little spice but it is an interesting story, now that i finished it i stand by my original review. I love the OST sell me a FLAC version sekai project
10/10 would buy again.
My P key broke playing this game.
I have a semi-furry fetish now
You can play it with one hand. Patch required for full fun.
Neko's i love Neko's OMFG 9/10 Loved it. it's a good game.
It has one of the most requested R-18 patches ever.  - Bind P "bounciness".
Literally , the BEST visual novel I have ever played. If you're interested in ecchi stuff , this game is a must-have! Don't forget to download [url=http://imouto.club/nekopara/] uncensored patch[/url]. I really appreaciate that steam didn't ban it.  Well , maybe I'll list the positive aspects of this game that impressed me just to make sure you will buy it :3   :  - Art style  - Plot ([spoiler] the idea of catgirls[/spoiler]) - Characters in this story  - I could feel like I really was the main protagonist  - Good and sometimes sophisicated sense of humour---> I laughed a lot  - [spoiler] SEX [/spoiler] - the game is worth its price  Minuses :  - There's still no Vol.2   Edit: Minuses: - None  69/69
Only took me 2 minutes to cum 10/10 IGN
What in the Oblivion Steam? When I heard this game has sex cut from it I expected something like Playstation 2 port of Fate Stay Night (excellent VN, play it), where they removed sex completely, and replaced sex scenes with apropriate scenes (storywise), and here we get: "Oh they do have sex, no you're not getting to watch it, you could get traumatized." treatment... OK, I understand that it's actually loli, so I guess there are some issues with showing them, but at the same time it's clearly shown they do get in action, so it's kinda useless censoring it (playing kinetic novel centered on relationship progress with sex clearly happening, but not shown, is like watching soccer game with every goal not being shown). Especially taking into account how Nekopara was created (I mean Vanilla and Chocola as characters).  Which takes me to other point. Why is it not OK to show sex on steam, but it's OK to show dismemberment, gore, mutilation, etc... A year ago friends kid, who for some reason likes to latch onto me asked me to download game for him called Sniper Elite, and out of curiosity, I decided to watch some videos from this series. In one lets play video PC shot a guy from sniper and suddenly game cut to a cutscene where bullet in slowmotion exited gun, hit victims head, and then we got to see how his skull got crushed, brain splattered, and bulet exited on the other side. IN GREAT DETAIL.  That game is not censored on Steam (I could not find any mention on censoring). Why is it OK to watch guys brain being splattered, but not OK to see a naked girl?
Coconut is the only grown looking cat grill in this and she says Meow and calls MC onii-chan.  Enough reason to buy this tbh
Turns out dating catgirls is borderline exploiting people with mental illness, pretty creepy, trash story.
well, my harem just about to start >_<

Disappointing my parents has never been more fun
I reccomend this game...             but first remember to get uncensored patch before playing.  Trust me you will need it.
I finished this game yesterday. Upon reflection, I have one major memory of it:  SO FREAKIN' CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE~! X3  Though, I'm a huge fan of cats, so I might be a bit biased. ;3  If you love heartwarming adorableness and kitties out in human-ish bodies, then this game is for you!
This game gave me a whole new meaning when it comes to hanging out with friends. We laughed. We cried. We fapped.  It was a jolly good time.  10 friends fapping/10
I got this from a friend. I really did.  But anyway, It's one of the best VN I've ever played. That's a fact.
I want to see H 18+ scene  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
*ahem* CATGIRLS.TWO OF THEM.THEY'RE BOTH CUTE,THEY'RE BOTH WILLING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. 11/10 would nyaa again
what the fuck  Knowing that I own this is like a scar on my profile tbh. Every day I wake up and I see this in my library, when I see it on the store it says "In Library." This game haunts my dreams every night.  I can't escape.
中文/Eng  You won’t want to beat it!  1. Traditional English language (a lovely buddy for your Japanese and Chinese learning)  2. When you move the window, the breasts vibrate along. An effect you won’t even get when you shake your girlfriend or steam.  3. Neko is so lovely, how can you ever say no to her?  4. You can sell the cards to make money,but surely you’d better synthesize the badge of rank 5, the achievement looks good. A synthesized background pays off, so it is just a free game! Fun and happiness games+1, and Neko.  5. The facial expressions are kawaii! Who doesn’t have a Neko nowadays?   6. It is the version for all ages. If you want the R18 version, just download online to completely overwrite it.  7. The plots are full of love. A look at the Neko relieves all your stress from work and lightens your life. It is really good stuff for any salary man.   作為steam名著之一：貓。  怎麼有不買的理由呢？ 1.繁體中文+英文(還可以學習英語日語呢) 2.移動視窗乳搖啊，你搖搖你女朋友或者右手又或者steam看看有沒有這效果？！ 3.貓娘那麼可愛，怎麼可能不心動？ 4.把卡片掛出來也能賣一筆啊當然最好合五次，成就也很好看！合背景！直接回本！根本就是免費遊戲！開開心心+1又有貓 5.表情也很可愛啊！你看還有誰沒有貓的！ 6.這是全年齡版，若喜歡ero可以上網下載直接完全覆蓋！ 7.劇情有愛，工作回家看看貓貓壓力完完全走降下來，人生也有希望了，對工作黨也毫無壞處！ 8.若然你看完我的評論還沒買，就給我一個"沒有幫助"吧   作为steam名著之一：猫。  怎麽有不买的理由呢？ 1.繁体中文+英文(还可以学习英语日语呢) 2.移动视窗乳摇啊，你摇摇你女朋友或者右手又或者steam看看有没有这效果？！ 3.猫娘那麽可爱，怎麽可能不心动？ 4.把卡片挂出来也能卖一笔啊当然最好合五次，成就也很好看！合背景！直接回本！根本就是免费游戏！开开心心+1又有猫 5.表情也很可爱啊！你看还有谁没有猫的！ 6.这是全年龄版，若喜欢ero可以上网下载直接完全覆盖！ 7.剧情有爱，工作回家看看猫猫压力完完全走降下来，人生也有希望了，对工作党也毫无坏处！ 8.若然你看完我的评论还没买，就给我一个"没有帮助"吧
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a phenomenal game; it's respectively one of the most popular visual novels on Steam. Though the main story-line of the game is fairly average without much action, it still manages to keep the user entranced in the game. What it lacks in action, it makes up for in character development; this resaulting in the adoration of the main characters (Chocola and Vanilla).  I highly recommend NEKOPARA Vol. 1 to anyone interested in visual novels. However, if you've only come for the NSFW content NEKOPARA is rumored to contain, I'm afraid you won't find that here. The Steam version of the NEKOPARA series is the non-NSFW version.  I'd also recommend checking out NEKOPARA Vol. 0 for some insight to the story-line and characters of the game. Although Vol. 1 is entirly playable without having played Vol. 0.
Cute story great badges, emotes, and backgrounds
MAX TITTY BOUNCINESS!
Not a very long game but will make you feel the need to hide away from friends and family for a while.
very nice 11/10 must play with no censor
It's so fucking awesome
10/10, best game NA, have the best graphics + physics kek played this valentine's day, where every scrubs with girlfriends go out and we stay at home. instead of wasting time on csgo for 24hrs, I wasted my time on this game. 69/420 all i did was: 1. bind a macro for P key 2. click P for bounciness. 3. press space to switch scenes with left hand.
i dont know why but i never really got in to this game and ended up uninstalling not long after i started playing so dont get it.

You saved us all from utter non-fapnihalation! Trump:           Fapping is what makes the world go round, and all the money in the world couldn't make up for it. Not even mine.   And with that, it was decreed: "Nekopara for all!" 10/10 IGN Best game. Best game? Best game.  Trump 2016
I had sticky keys after playing this
This is perhaps the best casual game I've played, though Nekopara is a visual novel, so technically it's not a game. I'm still on my 1st runthrough (sorry, gotta spend a bit of time enjoying the nyamazing graphics), but whenever I'm feeling really stressed, I know I can count on Chocola and Vanilla to bail me out. ∞/10
I'm so fucking confused.
First of All, for those who doesn't know this is "STEAM CENSORED" version, which mean there is no S** Scene in it  On to the Review  The game is pretty straight forward, you don't need to do anything but click through the story (LITERALLY, there is even an auto play feature to save you all the problem of clicking your mouse).  Pros :  The art are pretty nice and smooth, it pretty and will satisfy any otaku,anime, and cat lovers. The story is short but still heart warming.  Cons :  It really doesn't have much difference from other VN games, which is a shame cause it has potential to be a bit more original in the story, and this game has LITERALLY 1 path and 1 ending, there are no choices need to be made during the whole gameplay, you only need to keep clicking and move along with the story, which is a real shame that made this game has no replay value whatsoever, considering the short story of the game itself, and for the price tag, its not really worth buying if your not really into the VN game genre or cat girls  Overall, i think this game is really good (even though considering the cons are longer than the pros) for those who love VN games in general, it has almost has everything you wanted from a VN. The cute and loveable character combined with a heart warming story makes up for it lacks of replay value and choices within the game. as for the price it self, its maybe a litte bit too expensive considering you only have 1 story line to play, but the beauty of the art within the game is pretty much worthwhile, especially for those who love VN games
What better way to spend valentines day than with a couple of cat girls in made outfits?
Strangely toooo much cuteness. When I played this game I'm always smileyed and laughed like a retard. Just buy this game!!!  -Cute -Cats -Action -Cake -Grilllllls
I have no regrets...... 10/10
I am unable to find the uncensored patch pls halp meh.  I am writing this from a tent outside my house.
i bought this game. Yeah, i said it.   6/6 nekos agree that you should play this game

Best GAME Ever!!!
[b]This is possibly one of the greatest games/VNs ever made. Ever.[/b]  Recently I've been pushing myself to write longer reviews about products on here. But this one...I don't know where to start.  I mean, the whole thing is just incredible. It's about catgirls for crying out loud! CATGIRLS! Granted, it's the slightly edited 'all ages' release, but that can be easily fixed simply by checking the discussion board or visiting the guide section.  There really isn't anything more I can say other than, "stop reading this and just buy it already", but if you need a pros 'n' cons list, here you go.  [u]The Good[/u] + Catgirls + Catgirls + Catgirls + Great soundtrack (the opening theme is stuck in my head forever) + Light-hearted humour + Pleasant story + Nekos + Obligatory adorable little sister + Excellent voice acting + *cough*18+ stuff too*cough*  [u]The Bad[/u] - A bit short (solution: replay as often as need be) - Steam won't sell the 'full' version (again, easily fixed)
Neko here Neko there :3 nyaaaa ^_^
I don't care what anyone says this game is amazing. The characters will actually move around on the screen unlike most vn and there can show even more expression by this emoticon thing that i don't understand. You don't get any choices in the game but there are othere vn like that as well. There is also a vol 0 and hopefully we get vol 2 soon on steam for the continuation of the story
[h1]Genesis 1[/h1]  [b]The Beginning[/b] [b]1[/b] In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. [i]2[/i] Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.  [i]3[/i] And God said, "Let there be catgirls", and there were catgirls. [i]4[/i] God saw that catgirls were good and he separated the light from the darkness. [i]5[/i] God called the light "Vanilla," and the darkness he called "Chocola." And so there were catgirls - the first day.
Who needs gf anyway,when you can have  cute catgirls by your side <3
Waifu over laifu.

Remember to go offline before playing so no one knows you're a dissapointment to your family

Cute girls doing lewd things. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) [b] Do not forget to download the r18 patch for more "immersive" experience. [/b]
You don't play this and just settle for the plot.
My mom told me：  don't lick the screen any more！！
Mac support PLZ!
Meow,Mewo horny,horny the classiest game on this side of steam! i feel sorry for you if you haven't play even more sorry if you don't have the 18+ patch.
it's a good game hah
god,adolf forgive me for i have sinned.
Who needs to date when you can sleep with catgirls?
If you dont have this game you are doing life wrong
Yeah if you like this you're really gay
Cuteness overload 10/10
it was a very nice game. and it is not expensive at all, it also have a good story, with good CG.
ALT+TAB: THE GAME
P button. That's all I can say...
Going offline Simulator 2016
Very cute, great voice work, art is fantastic. On the visual novel scale it rates top, as it is one of the best VN's I've played so far. It's also very humorous, and sweet. If you like VN's this is one of the better ones. Worth a buy at any price.
Someone came to my house and his cronys held me down as he bought it and installed it on my computer with the 18+ patch. I wish I was making that up.
Very short visual novel. Well polished, the girls are cute, and the story's not bad at all.
I flipped to porn when my parents came in because it was easier to explain
~Nyaaaa~
great story and love Neko girls but this particular novel left me a little weirded out. i kinda thought that there was some sort of incest going on. snd the story did leave alot of holes and loose ends. i still recommend it but just...
Forgive me God , i have sinned   11/10
[h1] Loved it	[/h1]  Cute characters that will make you feel the same love they have for you, nice soundtrack and a good story. For people who know what they're looking for, there is a +18 patch.   11/10
7/10 - I've showered but I still feel dirty.
This was great to read and to press the "plot" button during the best of times
I need to play more of this game to give it a fair review
Cat girls!  Do I have to say more to recommend it? I regret nothing.
What I experience in this game:  -Play for a few hours -Sex scene appears (i install the patch for more experience.....) -Big mistake.... -Computer didn't wanted to close the game -Game not responding (stuck with the images and sounds.....) -Hear sister coming down the stairs.... -Panic like hell -Sister saw what i was playing...... -And got shit with parents......  game ruin life/10....
By far the most entertaining game on Steam for me!
The main characters are interesting and cute, the scenes are all entertaining  just add the patch and everything will be more wonderful :).
Good game for a lonely guy. It will bring you some heat to warm your heart up. XD
10/10 would fap again
IS THIS GAME ABOUT SLAVERY AND HUMAN/CAT TRAFFICING?!?!?!
Press the "P" key while one of the girls is on screen. Then proceed to never regret your decisions again.
?The game is very interesting or exciting :-D
>Played Normal version until end >Reaction = hmm. nice but meh >Realizes there is an r18 patch >POV and animations?  wut. >Downloads and installs [2 hours later] > OH MY GOD MY KEYBOARD IS WHITE  Best fap 10/10
play with 1 hand (y)
I liked it, it has a good enough story line and the chracters have some life to them with this type of animation. It's nice.
I had to play this game for a bet. Vol. 0 was a let down, but Vol. 1 was defintely a strong way to engross you into the story Nekopara has to offer. You will be very happy if you play this game. With all the erotic scenes if you download the adult patch, and the cute backstory about your two beloved cat girls, Vanilla and Chocola. I think this game deserves a 8/10. For its beautiful animations and Incredible back story.
Cat Girls...what more can you want...but for real is has a really nice story i recommend this game for everyone.
Vanilla all the way.. as many times as possible.
Only after losing my family, girlfriend, status, and respect from playing Nekopara, was I truly able to see the impact Nekos had on my life.  One of my best purchases to date!  10/10  I hope I made you proud Dad!  #NoRegrets
Definitely worth th money, even though it's not much to pay. The artwork and animations are great and the voice acting is really well done. Although, for the 18+ version go to http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&tid=1102298 and extract it with a torrent :3
i VERY much highly recommend this game to anyone who likes visual novels with comedy, short back storys, slight nudity, relatiable character personalitys, funny (as well as sweets, deserts, and food toppings related) character names, intresting story line, and last but not least being able to controle the bounceyness of the characters breasts.
KAWAII :3
One of my first Visual Novels and I do have to say it was quite good and entertaining.  Though I do like me some catgirls.  Good hearted story and a bit more involved animation wise than others I have recently played.   Though there is an 18+ version if you want more hentai scenes, but this isn't too bad.  I do recommend it for a good VN.
If you love fucking cat girls then this game is perfect for you XD
... There's a little bit of shame. Maybe.
First things first, this isnt a game. Theres no interaction other than clicking and reading. Theres even an auto mode so you dont have to click. I was told I should get this game by a friend. 3 friends on my friends list all have the game. All of which said I should patch my steam version with the R18 version. So I did. :P Other than some dirty euphenisms and parts that are very obviously pornographic, its not a bad game, without the R18 patch the storyline isnt bad. Other than the fact that "Catgirls cant have children with humans, but they can express their love physically" There are no "Cat boys" and catgirls apparently cant have kids with humans. where the fuck do they come from. This game will make you feel dirty and contemplate life. So storyline is good, then unexpected pornography with little warning, then more story line so far. Play it, contemplate life, possible commit suicide. Up to you. But if your looking for a game this isnt it, its not a game at all, its more like a movie. All dialogue is in Japanese, but subtitles by default are in english atleast with my experience.  this fuckin game man. is there a neutral rating? jesus...
The year is 20XX. In what would later become known as the 2nd Great Thermonuclear War, Russia and the United States of America, the two great superpowers of the Earth, launched an all out nuclear offensive against each other. The sheer volume of warheards launched was so gigantic, that many of the missles collided over the North Pacific. This caused the atomic fallout to blow over to the neutral ground of Japan. The pollution reacted with the double X chromosomes in Japanese females, causing over 60% of the population to mutate into catlike hybrids.  In this fast paced first person shooter, you play as a special black ops soldier who is a member of the strike force known as NEKOPARA, callsign "Master". His mission: to eradicate the catgirl abominations with extreme prejudice.  The game incorporates a new morality system of choosing to spare or kill various catgirls you meet during the story. Spare earns their trust, but killing them seperates you furthur from your humanity, allowing you to take more damage in battle.  The choice is yours, decide the destiny.
I learned how to use a mouse with my left hand. 10/10
i make the cake
The cuteness is strong on this one but the story is way too light.  You should play the R18 version that bring to you some heat to your cold home.
A perfect game for forever-alone guy. If you are an avid anime watcher or VN game player, you would enjoy this.  Spent the first 2 hours of the game uttering to myself "omg how can this be so cute". I might have diabetes after playing.  + Six catgrils with different personalities. Pick your waifu. + Perfect voicing of characters. No joke. + Comedy in the game is entertaining too.  Make sure your F12 button is working. You may need to press it a lot for those chibi pics :D.  Steam version of nekopara is good enough.  >.> The full version made me facepalmed so hard.  Anyway, nya nya nya~
This game is proof that I have a problem. 10/10
ksdaghflisdughliajsfdghlfdsjghlfkdj ^^ XD KAWAII NEKOPARADISE
Not really worth the money. Total play through in around 2-4 hours. I reccomend buying a different visual novel.
Nekos, enough said.
This is how the game was described in our skype chat:  " There is mayonas everywhere GOD dam its hard working in a bake shop SO MUCH WIGHT POWDER ITS EEVEVBRY WHWEREE and the doe1 so stiky with out flower GAH SOOO MUCH TO DO Now ther eis hot team EVERY WHERE Schlick. schlurk,Schlick Thats the sound needing doe makes Hugggggg----- What we going to do ont his bed boss? NYaaaaaaa! Mmm the zipper sound effect AS I OPEN UP THE BIG BAG OF PEPER!  Witcha!!! (It then link to the BurgerTIme Game grumps episode where danny yells "PEPPER!") "  Hope this helps.
This is the BEST visual novel I have ever played. Not only is the script impressive and the emotions strong, but there is animation, which is both new and rare for visual novels. Steam took out the 18+ content, but even so that is OK. You can buy it with that content...somewhere...a quick google search would bring it to you. Even that content is aquite good to other Eroge I have played. Vol 0 is great as well and reccomended. You meet the other catgirls in it, and just a personal note, I love Maple. There are problems, but they are few in number. There is never really a good spot to stop playing, so I suggest playing in 1-2 sittings, as close together as possible, to get the best result. The MC is kinda an idiot, but that is to be expected. There IS the holy grail of all eroge, just so you know. The godly "Physics meter". It controls how...gravity effects...the...chest area. Final notes; awesome professional artwork, backround-worthy work. Nothing seems forced. The girls are well made, personality and all around design-wise.   NOT RECCOMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO DON"T LIKE ROMACES OR NEKO (or straight females (this is a male-oriented game) THis should be obvious, but I feel like I should drop this in anyways.  If you liked this (as I did), Vol 2 should be out around Feb 10th, 2016. I know i am going to buy it, for sure. I don't even care if the reviews are bad, I am buying it.   -Vlad
great game if only steam version wasn't non ecchi, but there are work arounds for that so its all good
My life is complete with this... It is just amazing 10/10
Well, i honestly bought this to see some nekkid cat girls, but i got so much more than that. Most of the top rated reviews are joke reviews (lel i dissapointed my family 10/10 *gets thousands of upvotes*)so i didnt expect much, but what a lovely surprise. I ended up clicking through most of the hentai scenes, because i actually wanted to see more story, its so awesome. the characters are hilarious, well developped.   Really a nice gem, and not because of the hentai. Seriously worth your time and money, if you arent down with the hentai, this version is already pre-censored anyway (if you want it to be uncensored, there is a small very easy workaround).  it's a shame that real reviews get the backseat to the idiots/trolls/attention whores, but hopefully if you were curious about this game, this will actually help!  nekopara vol 2 please!!
It has an auto play button. That alone speaks for itself
I swear it was a gift.
It has cat girls.
Close and lock your door. Trust me, it's best that you do so. Oh, and have a box of tissues near you. You're gonna need them for "emotional" purposes.
nekopara r18 = ez colays
Awesome.  5 ☆☆☆☆☆
such cute
In this story you have intercourse with your pets, but it's okay because they look like people. No depth or funny dialogue, just censored eroge.
Very good story with wonderful characters.

My grandpa owned a couple cats. One day he decided to f**k em too. Only difference is the cats in this VN are still alive.  10/10
This is a heartfelt game about family, struggle and the ability to overcome anything through love and devotion. recommended for all ages.
Very fun It is the only Anime steam game i Know that has the characters movement in a rpg,
Cute cat girls. Is there more to say!?  It has an interesting little story, good voice acting and stellar animations.
Something that is cute, sexy and will punch your feels all in one package.
My dakimakura waifu whsipers to me in my sleep, telling me to use my power level to intimidate all around me. Mostly by making out with dakimakura waifu in public. There are reasons why I locked the dakimakura waifu in the closet. The fact that it gets out to do the whispering raises questions I do not wish to ask.
waiting for Vol. 2. and for Coconut.  nekos are love, nekos are live.
Lets be honest here, you want catgirls then buy the game and die of a pure moe' overload. There's nothing else to say besides catgirls.  Catgirl Review: Ears varied and with proper design (shape, size) +1 Tail lengths are all up to spec +1 Excellent VAs +1 Nyaaa? +1 Animation Quality +1 Moeblobs +1 other.. ahem... scenes included +1  Overall 7/7 would recommend, best game ever played. Touched me in special ways.
No Hope Vol.1
I jerk off to cat girls so fucking what sue me!
Probably the best catfucker simulator out there. not my cuppa tea, 10/10 GOTY
Friendly protip: Check if your pacemaker is ON when you playing this game, otherwise you will die from kawaii overload.
Catgirls That is all you need to know  Found the R18 ver I REGRET NOTHING
I No longer have Parents  This was a new account just for this game  what is a sun  11/10 -IGN
1st life goal to buy nekopara haha....
Cute cat girls
10/10 Lots of waifu material. Would play again. Cute catgirls, so kawaii.
This graphic novel/game is full of tender momments, hearth warming dialogs, and cute neko girls.  Loving it.  I recommend it!  Sit back and enjoy eye candies and sweet dialogs with a sensual side.
Nekopara Vol. 1 is the story of how I now have a harem of catgirls.  The VN is ok as the story is something of pastries of something like that... dunno. I was kinda distracted... Chest bounciness and the P key go hand in hand but your hand is somewhere else. Best played with locked doors and ambiance music.  10/10 for offline mode so nobody knows how much I've actually spent playing this beauty.
Just play it
Thanks to this game, especiality with the configuration of the chest bounciness and  with the help of the magic key from the keyboard, Me and my left hand ended up into a deep relationship. I ended up buying a cat even I've a neko-allergy...(well RIP).  11/10 Would play it again (this time a R-18 version) , I'd buy more cats and do some workout with my left hand.
I'm actually alergic to cats.
If you love cat girls and like a little lewd stuff this is it.  Just need to get the rest of the vol.
best game ever made.
how i play this game : -Instal steam version -Patch with adult version -Hide from everyone -ENJOY ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I LOVE THIS GAME! AND THE CHARACTERS ARE SO CUTE <3 Chocola&Vanilla 11/10
[h1]SCORES[/h1] Graphics/Art: 10/10 Sound/Voices: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9.5/10 ohhh i know you can do better :3  9 because of Vanila's and Chocola's LOVE story >_< hentai part: 10/10   OVERALL  10 wet cats out of 10     now i'll teach you how to play it(actualy my experience) : 1) you need to play it on TV  screen;  40 inches would be great but more you have more cutie cats you see :3 2) find R18 version, it'll have really interesting content , and install it (if you know what i mean ~w~ ) 3) now you are ready to play  4) press P botton when you'll see whole "cat team" together. (at middle of game story)  DO NOT forget obut it :3 ~~~have fun~~~   oh oh and dont forget about family they would proud of you if you'll show them whole game :3
Well it took me a few days on and off to finish this game and all of my issues with nekopara volume 0 were resolved in this version. I was happy to see the story was MUCH longer and that really annoying walk is very limited in this version which I was happy about. The story was interesting when I first started I didn't expect the story to go the way it did but even with that being said I enjoyed the story. It had a lot of comedy to the story so that made for an amusing read.  I wish the game had a bit more interaction maybe a story branch but even then I can say it wasn't bad. The images and voice work on this version are just as good as the first volume which I was very happy about. Had some "adult" content in it but nothing you wouldn't expect from a game of it's type. I personally enjoyed the story and I am hoping a volume three will come at at some point. However it didn't leave you with any cliff hanger so I can live with it ending here.
I once had dreams. Hope. Ambition. The day i bought nekopara, I realized that those were all gone, that all that was left was a shell of who I once was. There is nothing left but the cold embrace of death. Take me now before I get to the bath scene. Please.  THERE'S NO OPTION TO SAY NO
I recommend playing this with the mouse on your left hand and a joystick on your right hand.
its honestly really cute... maybe a little too cute.. its not like i have a slight obssession over it or anything.. quq
Cat girls in maid outfits AND I get to choose how bouncy their boobs are? 10/10. Truly the pinnacle of gaming.  Seriously though, really cute story, lots of cute cat girls and a pretty good story line. I would recommend if you have patience for visual novels and love cuteness overloads. Cause we came here for nekos and *clears throat* plot.
great game cant wait till nekopara vol. 2
This visual novel is great for any catgirl lover! Awesome and cute!
I love it, best game of 2014, super cute and also funny.
A guilty -pleasure- if I've ever seen one.
Its intense ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   But seriously this VN is so well made with amazing art and animation its just so KAWAII !!! great story too.  I recommend it to anyone who loves catgirls.   Just get the h patch and thank me later ;)  11/10. Will play again.
do i really need to say anything!  just "CLICK AND BUY IT!!!!!"
Spent the whole game going "Damn it! This is too cute!" 10/10
Nice little game for cat lovers one hour's relaxing after a stressful day
my parents are still staring at me...help
graphics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) on  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Better plot than Titanic And of course Some interessting setting like "chest bounciness'   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  11/10 Would watch it again
This game made me cry ;-;
Very dank game
FUCKING HELL THIS IS KAWAII!
Nice story but it's recommended you get the patch cuz steam pretty much cut most content (the good content) out of it
how do i remove this from my profile   [spoiler] jk its scarred onto your profile. [/spoiler]
>lovely catgirls  nuff said
I'm 26 and I lost my virginity to this game.  10/10  Would lose it again
To even call this a game is a stretch, its basically a visual novel on your PC.  The plot is so boring, even with the constant hints at incest between the main character and his younger sister and the lolicon background plot between Chocola and Vanilla.  I got this game as a gift, and was kinda eager to play it mostly because I thought there would be SOME gameplay. It's all story and basically two hours of clicking through text before the credits roll. $10 is so overpriced for what you get, and if youre hoping for nudity- there is none. one bath scene with censorship throughout the entire game. Dissapointed, not because of the lack of nudity or fan-service, but because all these reviews just give too much credit to this "game".
I wonder why this is R-18 with no H scenes. Had to patch those in to get full experience. 4.5/5 with patch, 2/5 without it.
What's with the crying and incest?  No ty. 1st and last japanese visual novel for me.
When you press the buy button, you instantly bring shame to your ancestors, your family, and to yourself, but it doesn't matter, because you can enjoy this lovely game filled with Nekos. This game makes the "rikura" flow trough you, and once your filled with "rikura" either you finish the game with your left hand, or end up watching oni chichi  69/10 would recommend the game for all of you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Don't get caught playing it
Pros:  - Kawaii catgirls - Sexy scenes - Lines you can take out of context - Much more  Cons: - Don't let your mom find out
Nekos: Check Boob Physics: Check P button: Check Happy and Sad Moments: Check  This is a great game to buy if you want to learn how to hide well. NEKOPARA: Hiding simulator since 2014.  10/10 -IGN Much hiding, such kawaii though
The game won't work on my computer. :(
Would bathe with them again.
69/69 Your parents will be proud of you!
I accidentally bought this game.  Anyways, its great. It has voice acting, animated movement, and cute overall.   Again, I accidentally bought this game.
I made the mistake of buying this game before realizing what a visual novel was. This game is more like a movie, more so than a game. If that's the kind of thing that you're into, then I would consider this to be a good choice. I mean the story itself is not a bad one at all and is actually pretty likeable! I personally was just seeking something with more gameplay.   All I can take from this is that visual novels are not really my thing, lol, but that's my two cents.
Cute cat girls doing cute things <3 wish i was the main
I really like cats
I do not need my girlfriend anymore, I have [i]Chocola and Vanilla.[/i] When I was sitting on Santas lap at the mall a few months ago, on his warm, sultry lap. I whispered in his ear, "I want anime waifu" And thats exactly what I got for christmas, in digital form.
I feel like I'm the only one who turned down the chest bounciness setting to focus on the story.
听说这个游戏可以艹猫听起来好像很厉害的样子
N-nyaaaaaan~ >ω<
i dont want to look at my cat now
Neko girls with a 'chest bounciness' configuration... This game also comes with an amazing stealth element, you have to isolate yourself from society to play this game also... If you get caught... The shame. But nonetheless, this game is awesome 10/10 would Neko again
I don't know what'd you expect at this point...  if you like Catgirls and Cuteness, go for it, no need to hesitate. At first i was expecting some kind of route type games where every choices you made in the game affect the story. But apparently this one in particular is just 1 route story. so... just click click click or use the auto mode to enjoy the story that's already served. GO! FULFILL YOUR NEKOMIMI DREAMS !
These cats rule!!!
Don't have this much time for nothin'. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Da kawaii...enough said
I thought this time it's still about day-to-day life w/ Chocola and Vanilla, like Vol 0, so I read thourgh every line carefully, and tried to have myself immersed into the story.  Then the "mating season" kicked in.  10/10 for the *animating* part of this visual novel.  And no, I bought it on Steam, but didn't play the Steam version.
You're gonna need some tissues.
This game is just purrfect.
Warning ! After you play this. You wont be yourself anymore.  Pro: - This game actually nice... well for perverted guy. - This game mainly sex. If you intended to play this I recommend find the +18 patch. - Cute Character - Nice Artwork - Flawless Voice Act (Mostly on H Scene :3)  Cons: - No choice just a "Flat Storyline" - Bulsht, Clueless, Stupid, Dumb Main Character (hahaha "They just liek Daughter".. yea you have sex with your daughter) (oh and he can "Come" 5 times" hehe so realistic bruh) - In the game 99% of the character is "Female". ( Female Police Officer, Girl, Female Customer, etc ). - Need loli more. - I didnt have chance to "Bang" Shigure. - Still need moar Loli. (well Vanilla is Pettanko... its ok for me) - For me it dosent make sense for there is "Catgirl" and no "Catboy". So this make this game so perverted (like me) cause "Catgirl" actually have a mating season but without "Catboy" existed (how catgirl are produced then?) and thats just make this game...... Perverted. - Yup... need moar Loli... cause ima Lolicon.  So I will rate this "NEKOS" 5/10 I put recommend cause im Freaking Hentai  add me... my "Friends list" is empty ;-;
Nekopara Vol.1 is a great visual novel, with a lot of cat in human-shape body as your catpanion. What is Catpanion you asked? it's like a girlfriend, a cat-girlfriend.  See? read that review and you'll be like "wtf am i doing with my life? dating a cat?" but, i have no regret... worth it
I really love the visual novel genre in general but some times it is tiring to just read endless lines of dialogue wit ha few scene changes in between. Now, if you are like me in that regard, then the fluid animation on the characters is a gift from god. It adds a little novalty to game in general but add a lot in terms of immersion and kept me interested through out.  It also should be made clear that this is a censored version of the full game (H scenes removed/nudity) before purchase.  TLDR: Worth a play, amazing animation in VN genre that I have never seen before (and would love to keep seeing), Press "P" and you win the game. KappaLewd.
each day, we stray further away from god's light
11/10 Nekos and Hentai for the win.
what am i doing with my life
Ok first of all I LOVE NEKOPARA <3 it has everything to be a good game like:  - Catgirls - Boobs - Kawaiiness - Cake - and Catgirls  - and Boobs  I love you Chocola and Vanilla <3
My pc is too powerful too play this game...
Best game if you install patch :3
Just buy it!
Cat girls, play it.
*breathing heavaly* "I think my waifu is coming to life"
5$ for this game with sale craft badge, receive rare background and emotion 6$ 11/10 ez money
each time i hear the catgirls' voices, i grow older as a weeb.  >tfw boob bounciness setting >18+ patch >le shet 10/10 would play again, kek
A short kenetic visual novel. Overall it is not a bad game.  Why not recommended then? Simply because there is really only one single reason to play this game. That being to look at very nicely drawn pictures of catgirls. Apart from that there is really nothing here. So if that is something you would enjoy, by all means go ahead and play. If you are wanting something a little more substantial in terms of content though, there is really nothing here.  The story plays out sort of like a 4-koma. In that there are chapters, but these are further divided into several short vignettes. It is basically a slice-of-life story about a man opening a bakery and training two catgirl staff. In a relationship that later becomes sexual in nature. And yes even this Steam version makes certain you know you are missing sex scenes, they just show the before and after.  I think if this game were a comedy, it would have turned out really great. The style would have fit a comedy really well. But this is unfortunately not a comedy. For such a rediculous background story and world, the game is remarkably terse and serious in tone. There is some situational stuff and jokes, but nothing consistant enough to make the reader have fun. In that sense taking this solely as a story, it is fairly generic and boring. It is just cute girls doing cute things, that personally isn't really enough to carry it.  The main saving grace is that it is short. If it were longer than the 2-4 hours it is, it would have outstayed its welcome being as simple as it is. That said the value for money at $10 seems a little lacking because of that. Vol. 2 really will have to do something to change up the situation a little. Unfortunately I expect it will be more of the same, just more catgirls in the shop.
I'm going to admit that I am probably not very qualified to review this title. But I'm going to give it a go anyway. The reason I don't feel qualified is that I didn't understand what the tag "visual novel" meant. I didn't realize that there was no actual gameplay. I thought it was some kind of little cafe-shop-simulator or something. So we'll set aside the head-scratching and slow-realization that dawned over me as I began to understand what I had purchased.  However, I like to get my money's worth, so I did click through the story to see what a visual novel was like. It isn't terrible, but it's also far from interesting. It's cute, I suppose, but even as an avid fan of anime, I wasn't impressed with the narrative at all.
the entirety of human history and technological advances has lead us to this game, the culmination of the human experience: anime catgirls with exaggerated breast physics. god has truly blessed us- the great pyramids are nothing when compared to nekopara.
My overall rating for NEKOPARA Vol. 1: 80/100  This is a game, that does not have to be taken seriously. Or has to? This visual novel is a lovely, relaxing game, where you can find both amusement, but also deep ideas about love, friendship, loyalty and things, that accompany us in our lives. Let's see this in detail  GAMEPLAY  + Decent animations + Format + Chapter selection o Some anime clichés   I absolutely love playing this game. It is true, that I picked it as some not-so-serious game, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story is simple - the hero, Kaishou Minaduki, is opening a bakery and his two most loyal catgirls are coming to join him.  The Visual Novel format suits this game well, you are progressing through chapters and revealing the destiny of not only Kaishou and his two Catgirls - Chocola and Vanilla, but also support from his sister Shigure and the rest of Minaduki's family Catgirls - Azuki, Cinnamon, Coconut and Maple. Present times are switching with memories in the right time, so the player will not get bored.  Also setting of Catgirls role in society was interesting, many procedures are similar to our in our lives (getting of personal identification card is a metaphore to Bell exam etc.).  Only what bothered me, were some anime clichés, like to much boob shaking (I know this will bring negative points for this review :-D ), but besied that, I liked, how this novel was able to change from completely funny, to very serious and vice versa.  CHARACTERS  + Chocolla + Vanilla + Kaishou + Shigure + Steam cards, backgrounds, emoticons o Azuki, Cinnamon, Coconut, Maple  Also characters shown a variety of personalities. Kaishou is on a big crossroad of his life, full of both hopes and worries. Chocolla is a typical extrovertial person, on the opposite, Vanilla is an introvert. All of this characters are transforming, they are becoming more responsible, feeling how it is to be in love and get closer to someone.  Setting of characters is brilliant, both Chocolla and Vanilla are at the age of the first love, filled with innocence and romantic dreams. Many things are shown metaphorically, but they suit their needs.  Shigure is also important, as a younger sister she looks up to Kaishou, but also gives him important advices. The rest of Minaduki's Catgirls were just an addition, game could be also good without them, but they were not something disturbing.  Also extras as Steam Cards, backgrounds and emoticons are nice and lovely, one of few games with that accesories.  SOUNDTRACK  + Lovely according to the atmosphere + Music player + Interjections  I liked the soundtrack, it was suited for not only funny and smiling moments, but also for serious times and thoughts. Very satisfying, also as the presence of music, movie player and gallery of most conmemorable moments.  Onomatopoeia is a very important part of Japanese games and here it was used perfectly. I did not know, that so many sounds and activities can be pictured in this way!  VISUALS  + Perfect, lovely  There is nothing to complain here about, everything was right as it should be. Animy style is a bit close to Shoujo manga, but it is not overfilled with sweetness. Just several clichés, mentioned above.  SUMMARY  NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a game that should get its chance to be played. I have to say, that you need a specific mood for playing, and when you have it, the story will catch you to the very end (I finished it in two days :-D ).   I think this game should deserve a higher score, but it is suitable mostly for genre fans and most player out of it, can see this game as childish and disturbing. That is why I have chosen this evaluation.  Anyway, it is perfect and worth to try. Catgirls paradise!  PS: There is a mature version, but I have not tried it. If you would, I will not stop you, but I do not think it is necessary to spoil the nice metaphores of the game. I leave it up to you.
I SWEAR TO PANCAKES I'M GOING TO BURN MY F***ING HARDDRIVE AFTER I FINISH THIS GAME!!! I .. swear on it!!! ... ... ... S.. sort of.. N.. no, not really. Yeah... So cringy though. I guess Japanese Culture does that to you. Still, great game :D
And now my porksword hurts! Great game!
Steps on how to enjoy NEKOPARA:      1.Click Start Game     2.Click autoplay     3.???     4.Profit  420/10 Best game ever.
I didn't know I wanted a cat, now I do 10/10
I wanted to like it, and it is cute, but it's pretty boring. It's just a visual novel with an implausible story. I suppose I could have gotten that if I read the tags more closely.
Download 18+ patch Lock the door Grab Tissue  Set offline on steam 10/10

My friend got it me for me....
Let's do a review without all the jokes here, hm? Nekopara is a fantastic visual novel, both in appearance, and in features. With Steam starting to take a shine to allowing Visual Novels, we're getting a lot of them recently, and it's hard to know what to look for. In Nekopara's case, it's lighthearted fun, certainly a bit perverse, but never takes itself too seriously or goes into an awkward zone that makes you feel uncomfortable.  Sure it's catgirls, but this series knows it's not to be taken seriously, and it knows it's very heavily anime styled, and they don't hold back. There are moments characters get chibi styled, the eyes show silly, emote style expressions, and they really feel very fresh, lively, and amusing all at once.  Characters as shown in the vids feel alive, as they are always moving a bit along the screen. Whether it's their eyes trailing from one side to another or pupils shrinking, it's them bouncing about and getting active, changing perspective, ears perking or drooping, or even the 'chest bounce' or so, the characters are very smoothly done. It doesn't change from panel to panel and sprite to sprite, instead it's animated, and it really feels like they're a bit more lively than your normal visual novel.  As for settings, there are some fantastic touches that make this game so easy to manage. The usual quicksave and quickload is there, but you can add 'notes' to these and your regular saves to really know exactly where you left off. The sliders allow text speed for normal and auto, window transparency, even individual voice volumes per character, music volume, sfx, and just voice in general, really giving you a lot of ways to adjust it and make yourself comfortable with the game.  The english translation is fantastically done, and the series is presented in 'chapters' with even a fantastic intro after chapter 1 that made it feel like a legit anime. Each character is very different, and while it seems to focus a bit more on two in particular, every character gets a lot of love and spotlight.  Overall, I've always been a huge fan of visual novels, from the really deep stories, to sometimes a fun and lighthearted one, and sometimes a few are forgotten or just aren't worth completeing. Nekopara though is not one that will fade away from my mind any time soon, and is worth the playthrough. Great sound, fantastic voicing, beautiful animation, user friendly, and just silly, fun, and adorable ride worth taking.
Exceptionally great plot
Lovely little story of independance, friendship and love :)
I do not recommend this game. It's long and creepy.  For what it is though, it's very well done, so I can't NOT recommend it. Really I'm not sure this game should exist...
A heart-warming story that touches me almost as much as I touch myself.
no pandaren 9/10
If u like Neko girls then this game will be for u to play, I also like how the characters have movement and are not sprites. Voice acting is also nice:)  Also make sure u download the 18+ to enjoy the game even more;)
Bought a game legally that i had to illegally download a copy of just to patch in missing content, GG steam.
Best visual novel ever :3
Pros: Boob Physics Option          Arm Workouts  Cons: Sticky Hands/Desk           Loss of self respect           Low Sperm Count  10/10 Dongers Recommend Playing One Hour a Day
I beat the game and I'm already having withdrawals from my lovely cat girls, meow~ ; o ; I need more Vanilla-waifu in my life. help meowt steam and get the next one asap.
I am going to hell. Good think I already pick out my house down there and filled it with cats.
Best game especially if you get the R18 patch.
Gave my left hand an exercise ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I am right-handed writing this review with my left hand...  11/10 would to Nekopara once a day.
vanilla is literally everything i want in an anime girl
it's good. can patch for reasons. has auto play so you dont even need your hands for the mouse which gives it high replay value ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is a great VN. Definitely need to purchase if you love Nekos. It's fully voice (only Japanese) and the characters all have movements which makes playing a VN much more enjoyable. If you have the Steam version, it'll take about 4 hours to complete. The R18 patch is about 1.70GB in size and adds all the H-scenes into the game. So with the patch, it'll take around 8 hours or so (depending on how long you watch the H-scenes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).  20/10 would watch the H-scenes for 10+ hours.
it contains sooooo much text, i was missguided when it said "nudity" & "mature" i dont recommend it, unless you like these kind of games
INUPARA any time soon?
このアニメのゲームは素晴らしいですが、私が文字を愛し、どのようにかわいい彼らは。あなたは無修正このゲームをプレイする場合、それはさらに良いです。
Best game ever
Masterpiece, has an in depth story with tear jerking scenes. Perfect for the whole family and it touched my heart. 10/10
It's so cuuuuuuuuute.  <3
I can explain why I own this guys, I promise.  Also, it's a great novel, I love it. :P
"I know that catgirls and humans can't have children together..." Gee a great excuse to go ahead and try to lovemate with 2 catgirls. 10/10
You have 2 buckets full of neko cum, how many nekos do you have? (0, because your a lonley virgin looking for his first like me.)
Pretty good, hehehe :^)
Nekogirls
Why doesn't this have a stealth tag yet?
I feel that if you are reading this you know what this is. Its a visual novel starring mainly 2 Catgirls and a mainly faceless protag with no choices. If you are looking for hardcore then I say look elsewhere. But what story is there is interesting and I was able to stay invested enough in the characters to see it through to the end. To be honest the H-Scenes really just gave more context to the story as you get to see how the relationship is developing between them all.  I paid $5 for it on sale, and it was worth it. While I dont see myself going through it again it was about 7 hours and change in length. Thats not a bad ratio. Might pick up Vol.2 as well. I would say probably even worth the buy at $10, but thats my opinion. I enjoyed it, you might too.
good thing there are save files so i can store the goods
I enjoy this game very much and doing [strike]fap-[/strike] physical exercise Don't forget a box of tissue too! Too swipe your sweat ofc    10/10 would play this game again and doing some physical exercise [spoiler] dont forgot the R-18 patch [/spoiler]
Okay, so i finally am through with this game. Time to write the review.  Pros: + Funny + R18 patch  Cons: - Your family WILL disown you. - You will need to resupply household's tissues - Handburns. - Not enough screen time for Coconut.  5/7
Accept it, you're already on this store page and checking reviews to see if you should buy it. Accept that you're probably already a disappointment to your friends and family. Accept that you're probably lonely. Accept that Chocola and Vanilla are the best Neko waifus you could ask for. Accept Catgirl Paradise. Accept NEKOPARA as your new life. Accept your fate as Master of ultimate Neko waifus. Now, embrace it.
10/10 would play again GG
Now I can die without regrets.
no
get the patched version 10/10
"They were like daughters but also lovers." 10/10 Would feel awkward again.
It's an over the top, tasteless, linear kinetic novel about cat girls. Buy it.
Nekopara is a visual novel, catering for VN fans and neko/nekomimi (catgirl) fans. If you love neko/nekomimi, you have to buy this one. Important note: There is not any gameplay in Nekopara, this is not a dating sim. It's more like a streaming novel with very cute and animated pictures and brilliant voicework. Maybe kind of a controllable anime with you as the main character? Anyway, do not expect any gameplay at all. WHn you finish the game, do not forget to check the extras section for adorable screenshots, music and videos. Have fun! ^_^
Best game i have ever tried, you can have 2 catgirls helping you with your store aaaaand you have to help them with their heat, A GREAT DEAL !!!! JUST BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET.
Such a cute story! A bit odd, but that's anime for you xD
We need Nekopara Vol. 2 "~"
Cat girls didn't even have 8 nipples   0/10 Not scientifically accurate
If you play this game you deserve cancer... No your whole family deserves cancer you f***boy N*****... You Weeaboo a** b****. I hope you die in slow agonizing pain, not unlike the agonizing pain your father felt when he found out how autistic you are. I hope birds peck out your innards on your finest hour. However that finest hour could be no less than you drinking bleach to fiery death. I hope you wake up tomorrow in a Russian gulag getting a** pounded by a strong magic foreigner named Ivan the terribly long cock. RIP f****** weebs...
There are so many things i regret but buying this game is definetely not one of them its probably one of the cheapest porn subscriptions i have ever found  definetely recomend it too anyone that has some extra money to spend
Yeah... you know why you're getting this game. And if you were curious like me and found out how to instal the uncensored patch... you know exactly why you bought this game.
Yes, there is an R-18 patch. No, you're not really missing out on too much if you don't patch your game. It's pretty obvious what's going on and, if you *really* want to see, that's what Tumblr is for. The only reason I didn't patch is because, frankly, I'm lazy.  Story wise, it's very cute and does a good job of establishing characters and scenes before diving into sexy tropes. The art is simply beautiful to look at and all the animations are very smooth. Music and voice acting are also lovely to listen to. Even though their cat girls, they're never THOSE kind of cat girls, if you know what I mean.   Characters are very cute and there is some solid humor in the game too. The only downside is that the story does leave some strange implications that make you want to take a long shower to scrub away the shame though.   While I do wish that Steam had left the R-18 version intact (especially when you have to be over 18 to view the store page), it's really not needed for this title. It's just as enjoyable and explicit without it.
i dont need girlfriend anymore ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I got this game when it was on sale never seen it before... still got it  umm...  10/10?
it's alright
SO KAWAIIIIIIIIIIIIII  10000000000000000000000000000000/10
It's not easy to talk about it without spoilers.  In short:this is kind of lovely,but it's also kind of sick(and it's not because of the Nekos only). If you have ever read a visual novel,you know,how this will end too.So I can tell that this story's love is based on caring and gratitude since the Nekos' childhood(as I see).
Adorable Nekomimi set in a heartwarming story.  10/10 - What more could you ask for <3~
great plot Nya~/10
im fapping this game hard
So far a really cute story. The engine they use is really great and immersive for a VN. The CGs and everything are well drawn and very animated. Game took about 3 hours to read.
There is a slider for Boob Bounciness 10/10
Just like a story book.. Not even an interactive one. Very disappointing
You see all these poeple saying it gave them boners...man i sold my tf sh!t to buy this, and i gotta say, with all honesty, even with the giggle physics, i just....really didnt enjoy it. Idk guys is there somthing wrong with me? i love cat girls but this game is just so unbelivably MEH that i just...cant. I dunno, maybe it is just me.   I wont rate this game as i have not actually finnished it yet because i just dont care, if i end up finnishing it ill rate it, but thats unlikely.
A very well-illustrated game, and very cute. A must-have for anime fans.
it is about how a male turned on 2 cat grills with the new oxi clean
Vanilla is so cute.
Do your Steam friends not talk to you? Can't find a way to start a conversation with you going first?  No worries, just open up Nekopara and you'll soon get messages from your friends list calling you a pervert and asking what's wrong with you!
nekopara visual novel decent story and of course neko style anime girls.The VN dosent have any dissions to make but the artwork music and charecter development was enjoyable the ony complaint i have is the steam version cuts the Heantai scens witch i think are very important to the story and charecter development and relationship with the reader/player. But if u dont think its that big a deal then go ahead get the steam version i did when it was on sale.Over all i wuld recomend this to any one who likes cute anime girls neko girls and anime in genral other wise this game isnt for evryone
Best Christmas present ever
o.o What am I doing
Great game 10/10
Parental Dissapointment simulator 2014...  Then again, who needs family and friends when you have these Nekos? =^ᆺ^=  It even has a 'boob bounciness' slider, what more could you want? (Well, aside from the *patch*.)  ------------------------  In all seriousness and all joking aside, this VN is very solid, has pretty good writing, and features the 'E-mote' system - where the characters displayed move while talking etc. - a nice feature they didn't have to implement but it is very much appreciated that they did. It is also very well drawn. The intro and outro videos are also pretty great!  If you like VNs and Nekos, I would very much recommend this one.  ...What are you doing? Buy it already!
*Dwonloads 18+ patch* *Uncle enters the room* Uncle:Hey Andrei...ummm...what are you doing? Me:Uhhhhhhh..... Uncle:Wait Isn't that the game that I gave you on your birthday? Me:Yeah It is. Uncle:Ok now I want to play it too. Me:Yeah but I downloaded a 18+ patch for it Uncle:Oh O_O high five...c'mon don't leave me hanging Me:*high fives* XD  But leaving jokes aside(wait that wasn't a joke actually...) I kinda feel that the Steam version(censored) was better since it doesn't shows the p0rn scenes and the story goes better like that,just my opinion I'm not a pervert but if you are a pervert and you want to see p0rn then folow this link,you'll have all the informations how to install it ;) : http://imouto.club/nekopara/
It ok, but I'm no weeb
In my entire descent into madness, I never thought I would play a game err "game" that would cause me to feel happy,sad, giddy,horny, and sucidal all at the same time. Your dense and douche protagonist of this "game" opens a cake shop but instead "embraces" his cat girls, Chocola and Vanilla.This will be the only female interaction for anyone who shamefully owns this...masterpiece. saddest reality of all is that we do not have or ever will, 5th grade educated catgirls who contain the best elements of Loli and Unrealistic Girlfriend and refer to you as master.... IGN and Kotaku also call it the "Best One Handed Simulator on the Market"  Final Verdict: Jacked Right Arm/10
help
Really a great game for catgirl lovers! it is a must buy!!!
If you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Very humorous and touching story, can't wait for the second volume.
I Never had much fun with catladys before, until i um.. fed them. 10/10
After buying on a steam summer sale for about $2.00 you get what you paid for. A short visual novel story, no choices, but the feels are real in some spots. So... 2 dollars well spent. I wouldn't pay more for it though.   Would I recommend this? It's mixed. Yes on sale, no at full price.
Dindn't know I could play the R-18 version on Steam.
If you're one of the people who found the "funny" reviews regarding this game less than helpful, here's a review that covers actual game play:  Totally and utterly adorable. Definitely worth a play if you're into anime of any genre. I know most of the reviews only mention how sexy and suggestive the game is, but it's unfair to ignore the other factors that make this game shine. Nekopara Vol. 1 is also...  Cute. Insanely cute. Funny. Quirky. Tear-jerkingly sweet at times.  The artwork is beautiful and the translation is, for the most part, very good. As you've likely read around, this was originally a hentai game. That being said, the game is very, very short (I finished it in a little over 4 hours, but that's only because I took my time and wandered away from my PC at times). Calling Nekopara a game is a stretch, however: it's a visual novel through and through. You click, you read, you enjoy the story presented to you. Plain and simple. But that isn't to say it isn't worth a look--especially if you can get a deal for it. I'm happy to say I played through this from start to finish and enjoyed it in it's entirety.
nekonekoneko~~ :3
This game has over one hundred hours worth of play time, just turn up chest bounce all the way and press "P" repeatedly.
I found this game much easier to play with one hand.
Get that 18x patch, I dare you XD
Told my mom i'm going to buy an e-book about raising cats ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), [strike][i] What she doesn't know it's also my next waifu [/i][/strike]
You like cute cat and moe girl ? Trust me, when you hear those catgirls voice, you would be like: "....I'm in the paradise......"  Yes. Welcome to Nekopara (Cat Paradise)
Thanks to the person that gifted me this game, I now know how to erotically roleplay as a cute catgirl.  Not that I, uh, want to or will erotically roleplay as a cute catgirl in the near or distant future.  [spoiler]I will if you gift me NEKOPARA Vol. 0 though~[/spoiler]
I am a huge disappointment to my parents. 10/10
Best game I played since Highschool
You can't write bestiality without "best". Thank god I'm not allergic to these cats.
tl;dr: 5/10. It's all right. Mostly just cute stuff and a lot of nothing happening.  [h1]Full review:[/h1]  Upon release, I heard Nekopara had become a cringeworthy, BnP-tier meme and unfunny Youtubers were doing let's plays and reaction videos and whatever other garbage that pre-teens love to slurp up. I quickly forgot about this, along with the game, until I saw it on sale once and decided "why not?".  First off, the story. It's certainly existent, but that's about it. Other than NotShirou preaching MUH MORALS at people who really don't want to give him the time of day, the story literally goes nowhere. It's quite honestly on the level of porn without plot VNs, and although the story isn't supposed to be the selling point, the game is strictly a visual novel, so it's worth a mention.   Contrary to this, the technical points were more or less up to scratch, the worst of it being no lower than "subpar". There are a good number of CGs, sprites and backgrounds despite the game taking the better part of 2 hours to finish, and the soundtrack, although nothing really to write home about, doesn't subtract from the overall enjoyment of the game.   Another feature I liked was not the chest bounciness slider (though that was a welcome addition), but the option to play in Japanese. Although this translation isn't as bad as some of Sekai Project's other releases - being barely up to scratch this time - I felt like I got a lot more out of what little story there was once I switched over.  Overall, it's cute girls doing cute things with H-scenes you can patch in. I wouldn't buy it at $10 considering the amount of content, but if this is what you're after, then it wouldn't be a terrible buy if it were on sale. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/blankaex/recommended/385800/]On the other hand, Nekopara Vol. 0 is an entirely different story.[/url]
boobies
First 20 minutes of the game, and I have to wipe tears from my eyes. Just. The art, the soundtrack, the characters. Maybe I'm just soft, but this game surpassed every one of my expectations for it. Just let it get to you.
I'm just an average man, with a not so average life I don't work from nine to five; I love my 2D wife I want us to be left alone in our average home But why do I always feel like we're in the Twilight Zone,  I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S WATCHIN' ME AND I HAVE NO PRIVACY, WOAH-OH OH.  AND THEY SAID DOGS WERE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND  Play this with your youngest sibling/relative.
This is a super awesome game that i played 4 time and i still like it. Now waiting for vol.2 will still playing it :D.  Still waiting till this day till neko girls will become real or till neko girls will visit our planet.
Neko/10 would play again
I swear I'm totally playing that to study my japanese
[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7-BX4bWYvg] I am sickened, but curious. [/url]
Cute catgirls, smooth animations, awesome voices, music and storyline - all this you can find during the playing NEKOPARA vol.1.
If you are reading this review then it means you already bought the game, or will buy it regardless of what this review says, and are just looking for a laugh. Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not funny. Now stop wasting your life reading and go play this game. You're still here? What do you want from me a joke? okay...Why did Sally fall of the swing?   Because she had no arms. Knock knock, who's there? Not Sally. Why am I even still writing this when I could be playing this game?
Bought for catgirls, Stayed for bakery. 10/10
I didn't came here after seen those loli nekos in the box, I swear.
uhhh
What am I doing with my life?
Best game evr. Bought it with sale, got only two cards and already have almost half of price. I was disappointed of that it is edition"for everyone edition", but some magic and I have work for my hand. So what I got for 3.49: cute neko girls, some practice of my english, some work for my hands and I can return my money back with cards. So it's the best game, if you buy it on sales. But if you pay full price you need to play few times, but I think your hands dont mind, if they have some work more. 10 neko girls of 10
HELL YEA! BEST timin to play is in the midnight of nobody watching .  BTW what is the last achievement i only got 13/14.
10/10 bought this to compensate for downloaded doujins
its aight nt bad  pros - boob bouncing adjustment -great 'exercising game' -nice graphics -works on most windows platforms -nice voice acting -i became a left and right hander cons - lost all my friends and family -not for minors -could use some 'interaction gameplay' -will never look at cats the same way again -i want to open my own cafe Overall 7/10- is pretty good
I was bought this for my Christmas, and was told to play this on stream. My mum walked in while I was playing and pretended not to see what I was playing.  10/10, she probably worries about me now
Meow.
this game is so good that I lost all my friends and family...  on the ohter hand it made me buy a cat...  but dont get me wrong...   I didn't rape it...  Yet
TO-DO List: 1- Install the game (checked) 2- Install the patch (checked) 3- Take a comfortable chair (checked) 4- Locked the door (checked) 4- Grab some tissues (checked) Let's do it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  69/10
I bought the game just because a big fan of anime games with panache.  + Graphic - very beautiful panache + Сharacters - all the characters are very funny and fun, meow :) + Trading card and easy achievements + Good price - pay off the card game  I can recommend this game to people that anime fans love achievements, or collectors 9/10 Meow
10/10 Would fa- I mean "enjoy" an amazing visual novel full of "plot" again.
NEKOPARA is not only a game, you need to think it as book that sucks you inside it once you start, and after that returning to normal life is really depressing and just like CIV, NEKOPARA makes you *play one more dialogue*.  The story is deeper than in Game of Thrones and the characters grow and change as the story goes forward. The game doesnt give you any chooses, but its made so well you dont really need them.   After buying NEKOPARA my life has doubled its value, even tho Ive lost some of my friends and my parents dont look to me the same way they used to before buying NEKOPARA, I still say it is worth it.  When im feeling really down, I turn NEKOPARA on and start new fresh save, and I instantly feel better about myself. Because in this world of cute cat girls, I feel immortal. There is nothing that can harm me, or my precious cat girls.  NEKOPARA truly is Cat Paradise.
cat fucked and Similar favorite > m<  Really want to have a cat Mother ah! My cat if the cat can become your mother would be nice (laughs Although my family is male cats orz..
(Note: I played vol 0 first)  Vol 1 might be older, doesnt have the petting feature (sadly). But is longer and deeper with the same extremely high cuteness level, sad scenes are a pain in the (<3) to watch. But the cute and (not really pervy) pervy scenes are. Either way enough of rewiewing, just go buy it and see for your self :3   Oh did I mention the R18 version? huehuehue  Now lets wait for vol 2 to be released ([strike]December 2015[/strike] February 2016, hang in there peeps).
This is a horrifying tour de force.  In the grim near future, mankind has genetically modified cats into humanoid "catgirls." This in itself raises MANY to question the ethics of the world at large if this were to pass: but it gets darker. They don't have the brainpower of a human, they are essentially children with some cat instincts as far as their minds go. So: without an owner they cannot sustain themselves in human society, and they are not physically equipt to survive in the wild like feral cats do. Not that they could sustain themselves even if they could function in either light because the rabbit hole goes deeper yet. At the time of writing this i have not finished the game but there is no mention of a male counterpart: the species is "catGIRL", they are incapable of (to put it delicately) unassisted procreation. They also go through life with all the biological failings of a cat (going into heat, GREATLY accelerated aging).  In his arrogance man hath birthed a lifeform incapable of anything but being a pet at best and a stray beggar at worst: and that must be (again, delicately put) assisted to perpetuate their species. A race of humanoids too human to survive as an autonomous community or being in the wild, yet too animal and simple minded to go through life in human society fluently.  And perhaps the worst part is that they lack the faculties for the deeper thought on these issues to even realise their horrifying place in the world at large.   If I had to rate it on a number scale, I'd give it a "SCIENCEHASGONETOOFAR" out of Ten it really makes you think
Never go full weeaboo.
Hey You! Yes You! Do You Like Cats? Well To Make It Better This Game Is About Cat Girls! So Not Only Do You Satisfy Yourself By Indulging YourSelf Into This Wonderful Game You Will Get A Erec....Ehhh I Meant You Will Be Satisfied And Will Come Back Wanting More 10/10 Legit Visual Novel Awesome All Round (Hint Hint: Press The P Button And Settings Set Max on "Bounciness"  Gurentee Will Love The After Effects)
it's not what it looks like. i found it in my library. promise
Mom, I am sorry
This is really good time, really built up my arm strength
10/10 Best Game Experance, Since you bought this game.........  Hide it from your friends, family.... Everyone.  Cus if they do Find out. Prepare to get judged by everyone :/
It's cool
Holds off the existential despair for a few precious hours.
10/10 would order catgirl online again
Never in my life have I wanted a catgirl as a pet.   I mean how can you not agree with these amazing reasons:  [olist] [*]No hassle of raising a baby for years - they grow up to adolescence in about an year or so.  [*]They're cute and obedient to their master.  [*]They can help around with chores and help run your shop.  [*]They go in heat and as the duty of a good master and catgirl owner, you need to help relieve them cause it might affect their health. After all, their health is verrrrrry important to maintain. Yep... it's kind of a hassle to relieve them but you gotta think about their health after all and as an excellent catgirl owner, you can't overlook it. Can't let them get a fever and collapse or anything... after all they are your responsibility. They also constantly rub up on you and sniff you and respond with a very erotic voice so it's very worrying. If only there is a better way to help them but unfortunately there isn't. So you gotta do it. Yep.   [*]They go in heat.  [/olist]
Start a company, get delivery of catgirls, implyly bang them later on.
HORY SHITU!! :3 :3 :3
A masterpiece for masturbating.
Very user friendly, only one had needed to play this.  10/10 would nosebleed again
I got it for the story.   (I thought I had a choice in the matter!)
Its pretty damn good! Dare I say it was pretty BUCK WIld in my opinion.
10/10 Would Fap Again ♥
A "friend" got me this game. We are no long friends.
good and touching
great "plot"
bought it because it was cute, ended up with porn, either way im glad i bought it, highly recommend.
I am the horny pastry puffer
Taught me how to properly raise my cats.
Vanilla <3
Even tho i just started the game i'm liking it :D ! .
i can has organism? wit kitteh?
>w< Guilty pleasure game. Who doesn't love kawaii neko's that you can pet? <3 Their voices can be quite annoying to some but I find incredibly adorable.
Something I would not play when I'm not alone in the room.
I can never look at Asian girls the same way again... without a pillow....
Nice little story. Felt almost too short, about 2 hours less than a route in katawa shoujo. But way more lewd I suppose.
I sat a bunch of my friends down one night during a party, turned on my computer, turned my speakers on, turned jiggle physics to maximum, and timed how long each of my friends could last playing it  Friend #1: Lasted 3 minutes before looking me in the eyes with pure unrelenting judgement and walking away Friend #2: Lasted 5 minutes before questioning his life choices and why he is friends with me Friend #3: Lasted 10 minutes before turning to me and saying "There goes $10 down the drain for me im buying this shit" Friend #4: Lasted 20 minutes before we had to force him off of the game as he was violently masturbating screeching like a rabid stray cat  10/10 This game makes me question my life choices
This costs 2 lunches, so why not just go for it. 10/10 woud love vanilla again
I used to have friends, till my friends saw me playing this game
Amazing game, the animations and voiceovers were terrific :) The music was great to listen to as well, and when you put cute stuff in the formula you have a terrific visual novel !!! Would highly recommend this game.
I regret nothing.  This was a masterpiece.  (Make sure to get the patch)
10/10 better RPG elements than Fallout 4
I WANT TO HAVE CATGIRLS RIGHT NOW !!! CAN'T !? THEN I WILL TURN MY GIRLFRIEND INTO A CATGIRL !! *honey, come here quickly ~~~~~*
This is the most immersive japanese family simulation game I've ever played. I can almost feel myself dishonoring my family as I play!
All the perverted jokes and silly reviews aside, Nekopara Vol. 1 is actually a very cute/funny read. If you're not super uptight and don't have some vendetta against cliches, it's worth the few hours you'll spend read-watching it, even if you go with steam's prudish version (BOOBS BAD GORE GOOD, right Steam?). I certainly laughed far more than I was expecting to.  Cons: Short-lived story VN, (non-skipping readers will get a good handful of hours out of it atleast), not enough entries in the series. Hopefully it becomes a long running VN series.  Pros: Very soothing soundtrack, with built in music player extras for your listening pleasure. Goofy cliches everywhere, pretty much guaranteed laughs for all but the most uptight/boring/sheltered of minds.  All in all, anyone who likes romance and CATGIRLS!!! . . . ahem, anyone who likes romance, catgirls, goofy cliches, 3rd-person speaking, and general sillyness, will definitely enjoy this.  Now excuse me while I go try and find the...Ahem, 'removed' content. F-For review purposes, I swear!
10/10 has catgirls and boob bounce slider. Short but enjoyable and is probably one of the better vn/kn's on steam.
pretty damn good if u get the 18+ patch, otherwise its an ok story with not a lot of ecchi.  The patch is free so ya... have fun if u didnt torrent this already
This game is great and extremely cute! But if you want to make choices this isn't the game for you..  Pros: ~Cute girls ~Cat girls ~Good plot  Cons: ~No choices ~To short  If you want a good and cute story you should buy it. But if you want a visual novel with many choices and different endings, I'm sorry but then this really isn't your game. I love this game, 10/10
This says it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIoglhtaPDk
Saw this on sale! Read the Reviews! Bought it! Played it at night where no one can see me play it! Set the boobies bounce settings to max! Never in my I have this kind of erection! 10/10 would recommend it if you are single and alone and a hopeless fuck with love. At least with this game, cats love you <3
I played the uncensored version when it first came out. To be frank, I regret that decision and would have prefered to carve the Nekopara experience into my head with the censored version.   But hell, catgirls. Just buy the game. 10/10.
This game is why Bob Barker tells you to spay or nueter your cats.
10/10 would dissapoint my family for neko waifu's again
this is a very good video game
This is NOT a game! It's more like a book or movie that you press the mouse button for the next text to show up. There is no interactivity in this game at all. No routes, no special endings or choices that can be made. It just goes on from start to finish with every mouse click. There is no H/"plot" at all in this game...  I would only recomend this ga....software if you're a hardcore nekomimi fan and have extra diskspace to fill.
hot ;)
Kawaii Cat girl wwww love this game =w=.
.▲ ▲. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good story, cute catgirls, Japanese voice acting and fantastic music. Can't forget the chest bounciness slider.  Best Eroge / Visual novel that I have played.  I recommend getting the R-18 patch for full experience.
Apparently it doesn't have the 18+ content.  Don't worry, though. There's a patch for it somewhere on the net.  So, a game about catgirls. [i]You can set the amount of jiggle you want.[/i]  Not done with this game yet, though it seems like it ain't boring.   A perfect moe-simulator.  I'm still not sure if I should recommend it. But heck, go ahead and get a copy.
Patch is good
There is so much wrong with this game like holy sh*t! -Why am I dating humanoid or cosplaying cat girls? -Why are the chapters so long? -Why do they ramble about eating teriaki or however you spell it, -Where are the black people? -Why do people get the nude patch? -Glitches are everywhere -The game starts when it feels like it -Why are the backgrounds so cool -When you press "p" your cats breast bounce -It's been months since volume 1 where is 2? -Not that I'll ever play this game. -Where is my gun? -Where is Migi? -Worst game ever played 0/10 - Gameinformer -Come at me nerdz -Why aren't there any ninjas  X: Signed by Pipster_
You can play this game with one hand
not bad
I liked everything
I bought this game so my profile could be an A+ shitpost, but now my life is torn apart by the agony of not being able to get the 14th achievement. WHAT IS IT? send help plz.
Sweet Vol. 1 ✓  Cute   Vol. 1 ✓ Funny Vol. 1 ✓
Ever get lonely and have a free hand? Get the R18+ patch and enjoy yourself
Amazing production values, a very cute story, nice music. This sets the bar for all visual novels.
Porn game with the porn removed. Bad story, dull (but cute) characters, and tons of cut content.  It really isn't very good at all.  I did get to own my own catgirls though, and for that, I highly recommend it.
Am I running a cake shop or a catgirl brothel?  \_(ツ)_/
Cat girls...What do you expect?
If you're expecting a GAME, you've come to the wrong place. There is literally no other gameplay than clicking and reading the text that pops up, this is not a game at all. The visuals at times were cute and if that's all you're here for then I guess you will enjoy this game and if you're just looking for the naked catgirl sex scenes you were promised by the nudity tag go find the screenshots online and save yourself some money.
so gud
Lots of meowing  Shows real life struggles of moving out  500+ FPS consistently   Easily the best game of the generation.  10/10 make sure and neuter your cats people.
Awesome!
''Holy f**k, i can adjust their chest bounciness... 5/5''  -IGN
BEST GAME EVER!
Not sure you can call it a game. It's a Visual Novel without choices. I still love it though. Most enjoyable. Thumbs up!
This satisfied me on a whole new level, 18+ patch reccomended for the full experience ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Touch Neko Tail~
Nice story, cute catgirls, no decisions, Japanese voice acting.  What more can you want? 10/10
It's fun.............
Still waiting for part 2. :D a great game specially with those people who have neko fetish .... Finished it for quite some time , only need to wait for the 2nd volume.
i like it cant wait for vol 2
猫猫萌萌哒
SHORT GAME - BUY ON SALE!!!  Pro-Tip: Press P when any girl is on the screen for instant chest bouciness (also an achievement).  Chest Bounciness Slider. Kawaii Catgirls. Harem.  Moe/10  2D > 3D.  2D WAIFUS 4 LYF.  69 hours played: the purrfect amount of time. :3
If you love cats this game is for you. That is if you are a really twisted bastard that always wanted to 'love' your cats a bit more.  Oh and there's no interactivity whatsoever. It really would have worked better if it was a movie.  Oh and there are achievements. 14 sweet achievements that you have to (almost) do nothing for.
So this is funny, cute and very well animated until it strays too far and gets creepy. It tries to walk the line inbetween cute and disturbing but doesn't quiet manage it a lot of the time. I wish they had left the "romance" with the cat ladies for lack of a better word out of this particular VN. It stands fine on it's own without that. Not saying you shouldn't play it by any means, but go in knowing that it's not all G rated even though this is the censored version.
Wonderful Visual Novel, but this is not the NSFW ver. So please take your perverted adventures elsewhere. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
Isn't as good as Nep-Nep, but it's good enough. *cough* +18 Patch is very recommended *cough*
FOREVER ALONE:'( PROS  JIGGLY SETTING IS REAL COS  TOO BAD REAL LIFE NEKO ARE FLUFFY FUR BALL WHY U NO CREATE DIS AS RPG NOT ENOUGH NEKO  CAN"T STYLE THE NEKO SHORT GAME  10 out of 10 would buy this game to comfort myself as im not alone in this world :'( there are always neko
I read until chapter 2. after chapter two i began to skip and skip and skip.. until I was able to decide something between two answeres.. but.. somehow I couldn't. ;w;   Pos: Cute Catgirls Eccie-Moments  Con: No Decidable paths  Just like a book
Just downloaded the uncensored patch. I don't know if I should tell my girlfriend about this new hobby...  10/10, I need advice.
Having completed NEKOPARA Vol. 1, I ask myself three questions: 1. What is the purpose of a visual novel game? 2. Are visual novel games for me? 3. What the flying fuck am I doing with my life?  Playing a visual novel is essentially reading a book with beautifully drawn and animated pictures but with voices to offer that extra bit of immersion. Nekopara is a story about leaving home, running a patisserie and looking after catgirls (I was  especially interested in Nekopara because of my unnatural weakness to animal girls.) What I did find especially interesting is that if you were to collate all the information you find out about catgirls in the world, and try to understand it, it doesn't make too much sense, let alone give a reason for the existence of these scientific 'abominations'.  On the other hand, they're SO CUTE, and I totally want one. Nekopara does a good job of telling a rather sweet story (or erotic story, if you buy the uncensored version) that is in actuality quite mediocre as I can summarise it in about two sentences.  The 'player', if you can call them that, is told the story from their perspective, which is as far as the game goes to involve you. Honestly, I was a bit bored, having just finished 'Hotline Miami' before playing Nekopara I felt a bit psychotic and was surprised to find myself a little disappointed that I didn't get to kill anything in the visual novel (anybody else feel like that after playing video games - perhaps you can recommend a good psychiatrist?) For people who need a dose of "kawaii", who are too restless to watch anime and too lazy to play a 'proper' game.  Ending on a positive note, you can speed run the game, with only one hand, in about 5 minutes or 20 minutes for the uncensored version ;)
To my dearest friend who wondered if the catgirls say "nya" during HHHeHeHe-scenes,  Yes, they do.
This game is so much fun it can be played with the family and friends.
Amazing!  Lovely Nekos everywhere.  Great plot. Happy and sad moments in all the history. You end up falling in love with both Chocola and Vanilla <3  I can't see my cats the same way as before. I lost all respect from my family. They think I'm socially lost and lonely af. My friends call me a weirdo.  IDGAF cuz I got Chocola and Vanilla.   Why are you even reading this? Go get NekoPara now! Totally worth it.
When my mum finds out I played this game she will disown me.
After playing this game for several hour, I experiencing some new strange feel. I can't look at my cats the same anymore.  10/10
You do not play this game, this game plays you.
This is my favourite Cat yiffing simulator.
For those who doesn't have a life and have dreams about cats sucking their C O C K
Exquisite.
Base game: Cute cat girls doing cute cat girl things. 10/10.  18+ patch: Lewd cat girls doing lewd cat girl things. 100/10.  I need an adult. I am an adult. halp.
i dont know what to say anymore hmm fine plot 3.5/5 additional character voice 5/5 fine artwork 4/5 boob bounciness config. 10/5 (when u realize too bouncy is not good option for entry level boobs like those)  anyway Nekomimi is good , have some (if u dare!)
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THIS VN!  Download R-18 mod in description and follow steps to play the steam-powered R-18 version. This actually works! https://youtu.be/Le1CfYosfCg
My brain just things to think about vanilla because vanilla so cute   Vanilla good waifu if i think XD
+ is a plus (duh) - is a minus (duh) = is neutral (duh)  + every aspects - they remove the s*x scenes, f*ck you gaben.  ~/10 - And now I have to change my cat's name to Vanilla.
Aside from some post effects to your ordinary life this is a very good "game" *wink*
great game
This game gave me dong cancer.   0/10 would not shag again
The story line of this game is great , the graphics are top notch but if u expect H-scenes in here ... no too bad
[h1][b][u] K.A.W.A.I.I!!!
This is a fantastic game as it provides catgirls but in return will take away all the respect your friends ever had for you
Truly an amazing Visual Novel, I loved it touched my heart so many times, I  recommend this Visual Novel!
i dont need meowoofs when i have this.
Imagine playing Metal Gear Solid with an Oculus Rift.  Now you have this game.

When you play this game...all you need is close the door, get your headphone n enjoy the feels...
10/10 would fap again
What is there not to like about Cat Girls?
Galgame is not suitable for me, but NEKOPARA is still a good game. Anyway, NEKOPARA has a shortage -I can't look at my cats even dogs in a normal way any more:P
Took me 1 hour to put the game in the 18+ version.   11/10, my right hand never regretted it.
This game will give you a boner and then make you cry.
SUGOI! BEST GAME EVER! 3KAWAII5ME! MEOWWWWWWW
This game touch me more than i touch myself :v
Haven't played this game long enough to give it a fair review. So far, pretty good, though.  Check back later.
Warning: don't dating with this game
Nekopara is a cute story. I really loved the story, but what I really like is the clothes the cat girls are wearing. I am in the process of making the Chocola and Vanilla outfits for myself for cosplay. If I ever get them completed I will post pictures to see what you think.   The story I give a 9. The artwork I give a 10.  I cant wait for the next volumes to come out so I can see the new outfits they may have.
cat girls  voice acting  and the b button  I BROKE MY B BUTTON  set titties to kill
No regrets on playing this on +18 Patch.  Bouncy~ Bouncy~ :cinnamon:
Not even my Bible protected me from these sins 9.6573492827/10
Good game if you like cats and bouncing breasts.
This game is...weird. Sorry, I should say visual novel instead of game, I don't think there was a single choice made in the whole story.
best game ever
ご主人ざま~~  I love them when they speak this word.  (´・ω・`)  15/10 for h-scene animation      (・∀・)
The absolute greatest game ever. Its cat girls
The value of replay of this game is over nine thousands. Really, the amount of time I have in the r-18 non steam version is greater than this one xD
SpaceBar to unlock 18+ scenes and achievments then install 18+ mod to enjoy hidden scenes. best speed run ever
I disappoint my family, but I will never disappoint my waifus.         I will never look at cats the same way.
If you love Nekomimi, buy it.. great characters and nice story with lots of fun moments.
This game made me contract cancer.  Please, for the love of God, do not buy this game.  10/10 Need Volume 2 Kappa Keepo
Nekopara very fun and i love chocola
I regret nothing!
Do you like cat? Do you like cake? Do you like a bar to change how bounce? Well the answer to if you should buy this game is in those three statement.  My answer is yes it a funny time 9.5/10 -too much cat
This was the most relaxing and fluffy visual novel I've read. Reading this I just felt happy.
my one handed level is 100
I swear. I can explain...............................................
WTF IS THIS?!?!?! 7/10 BUT STILL WTF IS THIS!??!?!
stop judging me
It's too sweed, it tastes like Diabetes
this game really entertaint me ... hopefully the make another series ..  (y)
I am now in a relationship with my local stray cat after this game. kawaii/10
This game broke boundaries with its "Move the game window to shake the boobies" feature, clearly a masterpiece to look  back on for centuries to come.
Will legitimately lose frineds just for having this on your wishlist  10/10 Would download 18+ patch again.
Kinda like it..
There are only 3 ways to get this "game".   1.) You like Catgirls and buy this game. 2.) You are a perv and buy this game.  3.) You get this game gifted and cannot decline (like in my case)   Now, im not gonna lie, this game is all about... Catgirls! Surprising, right? Long story short:  Its a Visual Novel about a character (you) moving away from his family to open his own bakery and get things done.  Unfortunately (unfortunately?) 2 old acquaintances of you get "delivered" to you. Chocolate & Vanilla, 2 very charming Catgirls.  Unfortunately (unfortunately?) you can't get rid of them so you have to live with them together in your flat.  Thats the start of this incredible journey.   The visuals are top notch, the dialog is acceptable and the fan service is great. (even better once you get your hands on the uncens... i mean, advanced version... so i've heard)  One small thing to add from my side: Don't play this when relatives are around, don't play this while being online, under no circumstances point out that you own it / play it / like it and ... don't forget to patch before you play.  Rating it 10/10. As a visual novel - good! As a game, trying to please the specific audience - great!
Has the worst fly voiceacting I've heard in years.  0/10
So uhh I really don't know what to write..   Nyaa?
NekoPara is a great VS. I love the storyline and the characters. I would recommend it if you would like to sit down and relax for a while.
Do you have a lock on your door? Then you're going to love NEKOPARA! The voice acting is great as well as the jiggle animations. The story is about a baker or someshit, who cares, cat girls cat girls cat girls cat girls cat girls. Durring the game you encounter the first enemy of the series, your disgusting little sister who tries to incest your ass, but you quickly shoot her down so you can get it on with cat ears and fluffy tails. I honestly do look forward to Vol2 to know what happens to the bakery. Will the catgirls have to join together like Voltron to fight a rival bakery full of foxgirls? WHO KNOWS! Thats all part of the mystery of NEKOPARA!
loved it because there is a option to increase chest jiggles    unlimited/10 would kill my heart because of cute catgirls again
This is a good game gentlemen's victory
Focking good super hot cat grills with big bouncy melons <3
dis sum dank weeaboo shit
DUDUDUDUDDUDUDUDUDUUDUDUDDUDUUDDUUDUD  FAST FORWARD DURING SEX ANIMATIONS 11/10
[h1] So Adorable φ(*⌒▽⌒)ﾉ[/h1]  Really enjoyed this VN.  The animation and bounce graphics were amazingly well done.  I can't wait for more VN's from [url=store.steampowered.com/app/333600/] Neko Works	[/url].  The BG, emotes that come from trading cards are also top notch!
I fapped so hard during this game that I broke the space-time continuum. I then had to travel back in time to stop my past self from fapping so hard. Now, I have come to tell you that while this game is pure fap material, just don't fap as hard as I did.
It all started some time a few months ago, a drunken moment, or lapse of judgement.  I purrchanced this life enchancer and so far, I only new a little dose of it per sitting and my life goes to better places.  Thank you cat girls.
Loved everything about this game!!!
got nosebleed
This is "A cat is fine too" the game.
I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed the game, The characters designs where amazing there voices suit them and there expressions where adorable. As for the story was easy to understand and at times you could understand how they where feeling very easily with the expressions, Each character was different and had something unique to them besides the whole design. Overall loved it and especially loved the interactions with Vanilla & Chocola we also get to learn a bit about them which I found was really interesting and added a bit to there character and why they where so determined to stay with you. Would definitely recommend playing this story also the achievements themselves are easy to unlock there is a hidden achievement which had me laughing at vanilla & Chocola reaction. I most likely spellt the white neko name wrong again i always mix up her name.
3hrs in and I'm finding it rather dull. Aside from a contrived conflict at the start the humor the plot are all pretty flat. May update it later if I finish it but so far would not recommend
Who wouldn't want a VN about Catgirls. Seriously. Get it already :3
where is pat button?    :edit: relised no pat button fucking sued...
Nekopara? more like Cat in Heat/10, would play again with Ero-scene.
Can make tits bounce, what more could ask for?
This is an enjoyable V.N that's about 5 and a half hours long. The characters are likable, there's plenty of funny moments, and the "plot" ain't half bad either. it also tuggs your heartstrings as well, but not too much. The V.N without the erotic scenes may make it a bit short, but I recommend you have it on for the full expirience. (the patch is in the forums) I'm excited to see how the story continues in Vol 2 whenever it comes out.
It's a game about a guy who commits beastiality, yet for some reason nobody thinks of calling PETA.   It's also a visual novel that's fully voiced, has animated sprites, an incomplete story as Volume 2 isn't out yet, and small moments that'll make you laugh, cry, or hurl. A worthwhile pickup for the strange people like me who enjoy reading text on a monitor.
Gave an Asian brain cansur with this game.
NEKOS NEKOS NEKOS EVERYWHERE!!!!!
good game
Only played it to see the nipples, didn't see shit. For the X rated version you have to go and buy it on another site and copy the files over onto the steam version (which you also have to buy) So dont have the community photos fool you.   -was also very boring as a story overall.
Im starting to love this game, one of my favorite visual novels out there so far >.< ♥
not fluffy enough
OK let's get the first thing out of the way: this is a kinetic novel, as in a visual novel with absolutely no choices. The characters are very well animated and the voice acting in Japanese is fantastic, at the level of "real" anime. The catgirl characters are very, very cute. The story lasts somewhere between 4.5 and 5 hours if you have it on auto-play. On the basis of these things I do recommend it.  There are some negative points though. A small negative point is a small number of mistakes in the text of the game: an apostrophe that shouldn't have been there, a word that doesn't exist and some awkward phrasing. The story is a bit rambling and oddly-paced in places and I felt like a "real" anime would have probably been paced better. This brings me to another point: I did enjoy this but a real anime would probably have been better with more varied animation and so on. I felt maybe I only enjoyed this so much because I haven't watched a real anime for a while.  In terms of adult content: most of the game is just cute: there's almost zero fan-service but there are one or two pretty adult things in the text (not in the pictures).  Anyway that's it. Please stop reading now because I want to moan about something in the plot but it is possibly spoilery and since the story is the whole thing with this, you don't want to know it ahead of time:  SPOILERY BITS UNTIL THE END    SPOILERY BITS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED   Ok, so I'm really not some tumblr kind of "feminist" or anything, and I hate that sort of person who goes around being "offended" and "triggered" by everything but really there are some pretty "off" things in this story. You have this whole category of women: catgirls who basically resemble women except for having tails, ears and certain feline behaviour traits, but apart from that they are women. These women are "owned" by "masters" as pets (but basically slaves, I suppose). They are utterly subservient, pathetically eager to please and very naive about the world and have to be told everything. They are used for work and for sex; If they go out on the street without displaying their bell that proves they passed an exam where they have to suppress their true nature, they get arrested. This is not just like the normal "harem" type of anime like Tenchi Muyo, Oh My Goddess or Love Hina: it really is a step beyond that in the treatment of its female characters. Anyway, I'm not really complaining about it or being offended, it's just something I didn't like about the anime.  Apart from that you have the main character saying some line about being a bit confused about seeing his two catgirls as both daughters and lovers which was a bit creepy; the drawing of them both in bed with him they really are drawn as underage; then there's the incestuous masturbation of one catgirl on the other (they are supposed to be twins), and the incestuous love the main character's sister has for him.  I'm just saying really that despite enjoying the story I was creeped out by a few of the lines in it
Catgirls that love you unconditionally... both as pets and as women.  10/10 would meow again.  P.S. get the 18+ version elsewhere also if you can.
Nice way to get some easy achievies + Story is allright I guess xD
Play this game guys, I recommend this game to whom love cute girls with nekomimi But, I have low exp at story.  That is my short review, Cause I can't write english as well. Thanks
Don't judge me...
i have done it... i have come online at exactaly 4:30 in the morning to play this game until 6..... in that time i beat the game 6 times.. *if ya know what i mean*.  this game is truly a work of art the reason i got off at 6 was because i had to go the hospital because i broke my wrist. the doc said "no more nekos" and i agreed with him.... but his words will not stop me... i will one day clock in 100000000000000000000000000 hours on record... i will... as i type this i am in a hospital bed.. i'm going into surgery soon to get my wrist fixed. this game needs the r-18 patch. not just for boobs, it makes the game better..  1 broken wrist out of 2, but i only need 1 to click. that's the magic of nekopara. it has your back. a man with a broken wrist can play it.. click away
I should of read the negative reviews before buying this, not what I expected at all. Plenty of other FREE games you can get on the web that give more interesting entertainment than just clicking through a +18 rated story with no actual nudity, violence or s*x in it. Its not even a game, completely mis-leading, avoid.
Why.
having not fapped to the previous title i thought why not give this a go! was pretty pudden until i added the patch that steam keep hidden from the punters now its...ahem...pretty good for a novel
Adorable neko girls !!!!!!!!!  Press "P" for more bouncy things
Honestly, this game is way over-rated. There's practically no conflict in the story, and what little exists is solved within a few slides of being created. There are *literally* no choices to make so that kills replayability.  Basically, you're this guy opening a bakery and everything just seems to go your way and everyone seems to love you for no appearent reason. The "love" everyone has for you doesn't feel remotely real and feels incredibly forced. As for the sex scenes, this is the pg edited version that has awkward jump-cuts jutted in there jumping straight to the aftermath when they're asleep and under the covers.  However, I will say if you're looking for a feel-good, happy-go-lucky, cutsie story, then this is for you.  Overall, I'd give this game a C+. It's a passing grade, but it's not all that great.  P.S. If you're looking for fap material, you can put the tissues away, because there isn't any. This had very little effect on my rating, because, tbh, I dislike visual novels that randomly throw in an extremely graphic sex scene here and there, making it risky to play with someone else in the room.
Omaj christ best game ever
Believe it or not, there was a time I had friends
Pros: Cute Catgirls Nice Storyline even if its not the best out there Great CGs and artwork The characters are animated  Neutral: Onesided incest Mutual Incest  Cons: No Choices it is just a pure story
naisu dezu  10/10 visual novel
A definite good game to play (Y) Best to play Vol 0 first before playing Vol 1!
0w0 This game will heal your heart.
Gnyes
if your a weeb you'll like it if your not you wont
First open NEKOPARA Vol.1. Go to settings and set the Chest Bounciness to max. Click Game Start. Try hitting P button on the keyboard. ...................................... Strange Sounds Happening. ...................................... Keep on hitting P button. ...................................... Strange Sounds Happening again. ...................................... Suddenly my keyboard light went off. I think I just broke my mechanical keyboard TT.
Neko <3
I bought it for the story
This is why I drink.
Steam has removed most of the explicit material and censored everything they left in. Get the R18 patch to increase masturbation efficiency. It's still censored, but now you get to see Chocola and Vanilla being the dirty little catwhores that they are.
I really enjoyed this kinetic novel, I been on a VN kick and got this on sale. While it is disapointing there is no options in this version of it (though hear that will be different in volume 2 so yay) the characters and story is cute, the voice acting is nice (though I understood none of it since I only speak English). It takes several hours to read but it does a good job telling you how the world works, the art is great and the fact that the faces don't just change but they move (even just a little bit) is really nice to see. Hope to see routes in volume 2, because I really enjoyed this story and the characters and cant wait to see more.
After playing Tokyo School life, I was very impressed with the moving animation and wanted to play another VN with similar mechanics. Found this.  Did I enjoy it? Not much but more than I would like to admit. Do I regret it? Somewhat, the story wasn't very good and I patched the game for the adult scenes. Not my kind of thing but I refused to play a game with content cut out.  If you're looking for a porn game, jump in. If you're looking for something with an interesting story, look somewhere else. I'll recommend it because it was well-made and of pretty good quality, but it just isn't my thing.
*team meeting* Shane: did you get the 1000 dollar boss? Me: i did Me: and then i bought a neko and lost all the money! Shane: a n-neko? Me: have you seen Nekopara, Shane? they're fucking adorable!
ez as shit game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)                          stuck at chapter 7 tbh
Nyaaa ^3^
This is all above others, Especially with these catgirls :3  10/10 Great Work on everything.
In the society of Nekopara, people use catgirls who are quote "12 or 13" for the purpose of selling fried squid balls at a food stand. This game is the greatest piece of literature the world...no the universe as a whole has ever seen!  I r8 12 or maybe 13 catgirls/ 10  Edit* This game is also known as "Look over your shoulder constantly so as not to be judged by family members simulator"
this game good as fuck tho, three bottles of lotion, two kit kats, and a box of rubber gloves
10/10 Cat girls Good cards to sell Easy 13 achievements Good story
Bought game, life still not complete. Patched to R-18 version, life became complete. Don't think I will be able to look at my own cat the same anymore
I'd be lying if I told you that you won't disappoint your parents by playing this game.
I loved the whole story of it. I thought it was extreamly cute and well done. There wasnt a part i didnt like about it i cant wait for vol 2 to come out :).
I'm in love with this game  1. Good story   2. Catgirls 3. Animations! I totally recommend this game.
Great Game !!! Especially after you install some strange patch ;-)
Loved this game so much I played through it twice. Can't decide who my favorite is, but leaning toward Vanilla! Only complaint I can think of would be not long enough, I want more! 10/10!
This VN is very colorful. The character art is really well made, and they're all fully animated and voice acted. The music is nice too.The story is kind of...lacking. There isn't much depth to it, other than being pretty cliche in a lot of ways, but it was still alright and enjoyable, anyway..I suppose not many people play this one for the story anyway. :P
After a while of playing Nekopara, you can feel your mind starting to slip. My friend has assured me that he, too, feels madness slowly creep up on him after about an hour or two of playtime. I would highly recommend taking it slow, playing not more than an hour a day, or you may see side effects of neko overexposure. Japan has, yet again, managed to create another work of fiction that seems to have a noticeable effect on the human psyche. Despite this, I know that I'm definitely buying Vol. 2. Stupid sexy nekos.  10 nyans out of 10.
6 catgirls + a loli sister accompany you through out the chapters.  Ok first thing you're a guy named "Kashou" who moved out of his family home to open up his very own pastry shop called "Passitre La Soliel". After he moved boxes out from the truck, he noticed 2 boxes were heavier than others. He checked it out, it was Chocola & Vanilla, family catgirls. From there, the story starts with three of them on a way to become the most popular pastry shop in the district.  The story is straightforward with no multiple choice options of getting through different endings unlike common VN.  Its blant. You cant choose the way it ends since it only has one ending. NEKOWORKS overcome this lack by producing a very beautiful art and outstanding voice-acting. 6 catgirls with 6 cute voice-acters.   Took me 15mins to "ctrl" skip everything till the end for free achievements. There is one achievement "hidden", i had to lurk into the guide and found out that i need to shake the screen to get that bouncy boobs achievement". LOL.  Overall a good score of 7/10 for lack of story choices.  Oh, dont forget to get the 18+ version. Heh.
I love this game.
I sent this to a friend as a gift. Now he's more into it than I am. My first time playing this resulted in the funniest text chat I've ever had. Good times. BUY IT!
It is very difficult to focus on the subtitles.
a beautiful story about a guy who raises two catgirls as if they were his own daughters and then f*cks them.
If there were catgirls like this in the real world, the human race would be finished
My first visual novel and boy was it a good start, had everything i like in this genre. 10/10
Possibly the most retard/autistic game in existence.
Best novel ever, 15/10
so i downloaded this game with full intentions of following the story............... but then that all changed when the R18+ patch came to light. IVe found my new favorite game for the rest of my life. I can die in peace now
Nekopara is actually a really cute and adorable Game, it is one of the best VN choices to have your personal Moe. The only disadvantage would be that this version is cut, if you expect the Hentai CG's. Besides this it is totally kawaii approved.
12/10 would NEKO again
Has a reputation for being kind of a hentai or something, but the story's actually pretty good. Paced well, well-developed characters, good character dialogue. (It took me just under 3 hours to finish, but I read fast so it probably should have taken closer to 4 or 4.5.)
Dibs on Vanilla
How to play this game ------------------------------------ Step 1: Download the Uncensored Patch Step 2: Play the game around your parents Step 3: Your parents disown you Step 4: Undergo carpal tunnel surgery from overuse of your wrist during this game Step 5: Profit?
Hold spacebar, leave the room, wait a few hours, beat the game. There's no interaction at all
I recommend this game to anyone looking for a light hearted read.
10/10
I don't understand the combat
Purchasing a cat - a couple of bucks, Getting a cute Girlfriend - couple hundreds of bucks, Getting your own personal maid - sometimes luck and sometimes just money......Having all 3 at the same time in 1 person - pricelesss: and so is the game itself 9/10
Nya Nya!
The BGM reminds me of the Addams Family intro.
liking catgirls doesn't make you a furry 100% fact based thank u based nippon for making games to replace ugly 3dpg real girls
[h1]A lighthearted story... with catgirls.[/h1]  A Visual Novel about a man, his bakery shop, and his catgirls. The story's light and fluffy,  great to read for a few evenings. It's music suits the game's light tone and should not  annoy throughout the gameplay. While sadly there are no choices for the player to make, I assure you that there wouldn't be a reason to. The Visual Novel's elements are modernly made, and makes enjoying the game an easy task. Character sprites are animated in a modern way, which I was strongly impressed by.   [b]-Pros-[/b] [list][*] A happy 'fluffy' story, perfect for a strained heart from all those Evangelions and Madokas... [*]Visual Novel elements are modernised which makes the reading all the more fun. [*]Lovable characters. Cheerful and fun-happy catgirls, must I say more? [/list] [b]-Cons-[/b] [list] [*] Veteran novel readers may find the length of the story rather short. [*] The sexual hints between characters may put off people,  who are strictly there to enjoy daily lives of characters. [*] The story's simplicity may also turn-off those who enjoy a rich, deep story  as there are not even a single choice to be made by the player. [/list] In overall - Nekopara is a pleasant experience. If you're up for some relaxation  accompanied by two lovely catgirls, I 100% recommend this game to you.
played the whole game, dissapointed that there was no incest.
I wanted to like this game.  But the more I played it, the less I liked it.  The story just didn't appeal much to me as it developed.  The ethics of this society where catgirls are pets despite having basic human intelligence is perplexing, and people having romantic and sexual relationships with them draws further question.  Plus, how do the catgirls reproduce if they're all female and cannot procreate with humans?  Lastly, little sister characters in love with their older brothers is a character archetype that really bugs me.  Story is the basis of a visual novel, and this story did not work for me due to the reasons listed above.  I know I won't make a dent against this game's great reputation, nor will I convince anyone not to buy it, but I feel it necessary to voice my opinion as to why I really didn't enjoy this game.
Chocola called me her Catpanion 10/10
Just a baking store simulator, nothing out of the ordinary.
Noice.
10/10 even better with 18+ patch installed. had many bats to the h scenes its unbelievable
I'm ashamed of myself for liking Nekopara, but Vanilla is so cute. purrrrrrrrrrr~ (=⌒‿‿⌒=)
WARNING!! THIS GAME INCLUDES: -NUDITY -INCEST -NTR -LOLICON -CUTENESS OVERLOAD -CATGIRLS  all my favorite genre  DOWNSIDE: -heavenly fog -heavenly light  but still recommended 11/10 fap everynight have a nice fap folks
I recommend that NEKOWORK'S make the a new game. Vol. 3 plzzzzzz I am so excited, also I am fan of anime.
Much Neko, Much Cuteness overload~  Well this is my 2nd VN that I play (maybe)  The story kind of some slice of life with extra Neko, and the E-mote also good (I like how their ears respond lol)  If you like Anime, Catgirls, and Cake then this VN for you :>
I guess... I gonna play that again. A bit MOAR.
Nice VN , Storyline , Graphic (y)
I never knew I could hate Catgirls so much.  9/10
Well, if u are in this fckn page, u know what are u looking for isn't it ?
Best "P" key simulator ever invented.  ....I mean great story. 9/10 for me. (;
11/10 would fap again -IGN
Game for whole family, even your animals   :happymeat:
I liked it. Pretty good storyline. Very linear and mostly predictable, but spruced up with enough humour and ‘oh my god lol’ moments that make it enjoyable. There isn’t a choice factor here, so it’s a LITERAL Visual Novel. The fact that the characters aren’t static images but actually move through different expressions in real-time, synced with the audio is a fresh dynamic to what I’m personally used to with VNs, so good job there. As a game/VN, this gets a thumbs up. Not for the price it's at though.  Also, regarding the tone of the story: IT’S SO FLUFFYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!  I threw up rainbows.
Bought it for no reason. Played it for no reason. Hate cats for no reason now. The story is kinda bizarre but it was fun. Looks great and has great animations. I recommend the +18 version for the real fun. (U know what i mean :3)
I swear i bought this drunk mooonths ago
Well, I guess I won't need to go to Nyaa for a while.....
Good story and cute catgirls, what else do you want
Purrfect
A game for you and your family.  10/10
Boob bounciness setting, 10/10 IGN
I don't need to spend $10 to beat off.
heh heh heh.
Perhaps, a bit to my surprise, but... This game turned out to be quite good.   The story itself, while simple, is enjoyable. It's silly, it's fun, it's told well, and it does the job.  More unexpectedly, though has been just how well the unvierse has been set up. From quite early on, we know how this game's interpretation of catgirls operates, their limitations, how the world they live in interacts with them, and how they integrate into society. The biggest surprise has been, though, that there have been a number of hints of some particularly dark undertones to things going on within the world of this game, many dealing with the consequences of human actions.   I'm looking forward to more, whenever that happens to drop.   P.S. Vanilla is best catgirl n_n
Best Game ever so happy to play it can't wait for Vol. 2(if there is gonna be one u better make a second)  1000000/10
i really need a life
Truly the Citizen Kane of our generation, NEKOPARA Vol.1 shows us a deep psyche into a dark world inhabited by young girls who are also cats.  Seriously though, I don't know a whole lot about VNs. It seems well made, though.
Pros: - Catgirls - "story" - Its rather cute   cons: - "too much plot" ( you know what I mean with plot ) just play the normal version - not really a game ( you cant make decisions )
I just wanted to bake a cake but these two cats kept rubbing their bodies on me and it was really distracting.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  This review is brought to you by catgirlcare.org.

it has setting for boob bounciness. Need I say more?  Legit though, this VN is absolutely wonderful, without needing to be overtly sexualized. I have thoroughly enjoyed every second I've spent on it.
A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME
Cats and more cats, what else could you possibly wish for in life. It's a shame it's only virtual...  - 10/10 would pet again.
I normally don't play VN's, but curiosity definitely... not killed the cat but rather saved it, in this case. LOL. The game was rather amusing and surprisingly cute. I must say I throughly enjoyed it. At first, I thought that the story might turn out to be lame, but it wasn't. The cat girls are cute, the story is cute, and... I do not think that it wasn't worth the purchase. Not even one bit. I love this game, and look forward to Vol. 2 in future.
Used one of the R-18+ scenes as my spray in Gmod 10/10 would get banned again
Best game, hunting nekos 1/1
made a friend buy me this  then downloaded the R18 patch  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) daddys home                                                                        10/10 my parents are proud
The question is, Who wouldn't recommend this game? If anything, NEKOPARA needs more cat girls! If you like cat girls play this game. 10/10 would cat girl again.
A game that can finally numb my mental pains and cure my apathy, it gives me a reason in life, a push to wake up make it through the day.  I can finally be at ease.  10/10 would restrain from suicide again
The artwork is fantastic, but I expected some interaction as the character, making decisions, etc.
Nekos are love Nekos are life and this game made my right hand stronger!
My heart has been over taken. myaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
The worst game, Its why we not need girlfriend, 1 of 10.
i guess it has a very sweet story, untill the part where the catgirls were in heat... But the art is gorgeous!
11/10 would destroy my social life again
Hands down the best game I've purchased on Steam. It will overload your mind with the cuteness. Not to mention make you laugh harder than you ever have in your life. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes anime and nekos.
good fap
1:00 AM and I'm completing achievements with a lot of toilet paper.
the game is awesome, but the +18 patch version is overload haha.. it looks like an innocent game then suddenly it gets dirty and keep like that for the rest of the game.. only negative thing is that the screaming or moaning or whatever gets pretty annoying after few minutes.. but still a pretty epic game 10/10..
yeah its good
Fapping is never enough
This game made me cheat on my waifu :c
I stuffed Chocola's pastries and creamed Vanilla's pie.  And I got Steam achievements for doing it.  11/10.
Crunchyroll and chill?
Catgirls and cakes
Super Kawaii-desu approved 8)
I cried so many times...this game touched me more than I touched myself  boobs/10
Well, playing through this Visual Novel was a breath of fresh air for me, and I did quite enjoy reading through the story.  Aside from that, the novel had some good and bad points in my opinion that need to be noted.  Do note that this is my opinion and to respect my opinion on this game.  Why do I like the game?  1. The Story is interesting, and different that one you would not expect from the Visual Novel genre. 2. The characters are very interesting, and each character plays off one another in interesting and humorous ways. 3. The E-mote system in the Novel is a wonderful addition to Visual Novels.  (Characters can move, seen talking, sway, jump, all sorts of stuff.) 4. The art style is amazing.  What am I neutral about in the game?  1. The Jiggle Physics slider.  Don't really care much about it.  It goes from unresponsive to Armegeddon level movement for anyone and everyone.  I just left it neutral for a more realistic experience. 2. The Earthquake Button... 3.  No dialouge choices... as long as the story is entertaining and fun. 4. Shigure... 5. The English sub could be written better.  I have seen a good share of bad grammar and misspellings in the game.  What do I dislike about the game?  1. The story is interesting, but It really isn't that deep of a story.  I know It's the first volume, so It can be different later on.  but that was a bit offputting when I finished the game. 2. Extreme lack of other minor male characters.  This made me feel like I was in a world losing a lot of it's men.  The only other male we know the existance of is Kashou's and Shigure's father. (I do hope the story includes their parent's in a future volume for a much better story.) 3.  Extreme lack of other character portraits in general.  The only other character that got a portrait was another catgirl you see early on in the story. 4. The Catgirl lifespan.  This was quite annoying that they could read and write in under a year after birth, this making them smarter than humans in that regard, and growing to human size much faster than a human was creepy.  Besides, they are a mix of the 2 species, A lifespan of 35-50 years would be more fitting for them, instead of a cat's 20-33 year lifespan.  (Maple is only 2 years old as said in her trailer for the game.)  Other than that, It still is worth the buy for all the shenanigains that go on in the game, the characters, and the story.
I'm still mad that my porn's censored.
Playing this game as some sort of comical joke, I half expected to fall asleep in the middle of it. Little did I know I was in for a long and sexy interesting story. Thinking that the uncensored version was going to be just a few tiiits thrown at you once in a while, what actually ended up happening was full on hentai. and hentai fkn roks :)
its cute and has a sweet story thats about it
This is just a visual novel where all you do is click to see the next scene/text appear.  To say that the writing is of a "Jerry Cotton*"-quality would be an insult to the writers of "Jerry Cotton". In other words, the writing is as good as in porn movies.  The +18 version offers additional nude scenes. However, someone who is considering buying this novel because of that would be far better off visiting any manga/anime website.   *Jerry Cotton is a cheap literature series from Germany.
Like so many others, I had gotten this game expecting nothing more than an easy fap to nekos. That was seriously the ONLY expectation I even had coming in to the game was sexy catgirls. First thing I did, before I even opened it, was download the uncensored patch from online. Then I actually started playing...  See, the game (story really, there aren't any options) met my very basic expectations, and added substantially. It really made me a PART of the story, I really felt a connection with Chocola and Vanilla! I didn't think of them as the catgirls, I thought of them as MY catgirls. I know that's a looser thing to say, but I mean it.  The story is very touching, happy, and bubbly, and is told with EXCELLENT art and animation. Seriously, they characters were always moving (except in the rare, beautifully made still images), and that little element really added to the story.  Overall, this game was far more than anything I had expected.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes nekos, and to be perfectly honest you can enjoy it very much even without the uncensored version; the story is DEFINATELY sound enough on it's own.  And as a bonus, there is definately going to be a Vol 2, based on the ending of this and the success of Vol 1.
The only game that I've finished in months.
Loved This Hoping for Vol.2 :D 10/10
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a VN where there are no choices to make. It uses the E-mote 2D animation engine, which allows characters to show a variety of emotions, and adds some physics effects to the characters. Parts of the game are missing from the Steam version, and can be obtained elsewhere.  Story: This story is about the protagonist, Kashou Minaduki, moving away from home to open a bakery. Two of his family's Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, decide to follow him there and help him with his work. Kashou, with the help of his sister and the other four catgirls of his family, learns how to take care of Chocola and Vanilla, while managing his bakery. The story is a "slice of life" story and is too clichéd since many elements can be found in VNs, Anime and Manga. The universe/setting of this story seems a bit dark; I still wonder how catgirls came into existence, why some are criminals and some are abandoned on the streets without a owner. There are a lot more questions I have about the universe/setting. Overall, I would rate the story 6/10.  Characters: The personalities of the characters are very clichéd. There is some character development for the main characters. It is really awkward how you only encounter one male character, the protagonist, in the story if I am not mistaken. All other characters, including the police officer, customers, etc., you encounter are all female. Overall, I would rate the characters 6/10.  Music: The music is great. Nice catchy songs, and even has an opening and ending song. Don't have anything to complain about for the voice acting and sound effects, except that there are only Japanese voices. I would rate the music 9/10.  Artwork: The artwork is amazing. Really good animations and physics effects for a VN. Some scenes are reused too much. Overall, I would rate the artwork 9/10.   Overall: I would rate this game 7.5/10. I do like happy endings, the artwork, the physics effects and animations. The story and characters are lacking, and I would not recommend buying this game just for the story; although I do not know why anyone would buy it for that.
[h1][b]Score: 6/10[/b][/h1] as a VN +1 if you like anime +1 if you like cat girls +2 if you are into hentai  [b]Similar Games[/b] Tokyo School Life  [b]Summary[/b] The main character has moved away from home and is opening up a bakery. He finds the two cat girls hiding in one of the moving boxes. The game provides a history on why cat girls exist which is nice. Chocola is obviously in love with the main character and Vanilla follows Chocola in everything she does.  [b]Positive[/b] The art style in these games is pretty much as good as it gets for a VN. The facial expressions and animations are all but flawless. The humor parts a great, but don't occur often enough. Strangely the romance comes off as totally normal for the world that it takes place in.  [b]Negative[/b] Well at the end of the day this is still a Hentai game with the Hentai removed so it could be put on steam. Thus the main character ends up sleeping with both Chocola and Vanilla giving you no date sim type options. Although back story is given for why this must take place it still feels very wierd. Wierder still is the fact you have a younger sister that must be the devil because it appears she set it all up for you to get hanky panky with them. The game seems to cover every type of anime fetish known to man and instead of giving you date sim options just has the main character sleep with everybody... which may in later volumes include his own sister.  [b]Conclusion[/b] This game is a strange creature. Somehow a hentai game without the hentai is proving to be a better product even for those with no hentai interest. Maybe this type of title will set a higher bar for the future of VN's on Steam.  [b]Value[/b] Honestly it's probably worth close to the asking price even if your just a VN fan. If you like cute anime girls it's worth full price. If your a cat girl fan it's worth more. If you want hentai go buy the non steam version where it isn't removed.
If you're looking to read a cutesy slice-of-life story then you'll probably like this.  Otherwise, if you're looking to actually play a game with a compelling story this is not worth your time. There are no choices to be made and no interactivity whatsoever. It wouldn't be so bad if the story were interesting and compelling but it's really not. Just some lighthearted cutesy stuff with no genuine conflict anywhere in sight and characters who are one dimensional.  The nudity tag is also a lie, in case you buy this game hoping for that. You'd have to go dig up the 18+ patch for the actual mature bits as they've all been cut out.
There are those time when you got to ask yourself : "Why am i here? why have i used my hard-earned money in to a game with catgirls and cake stores? For what reason do i exist?" then you realize,.........................................................               the game is kawaii as FUCK !
This Visual Novel Follows 2 Nekos and their master as they run a bakery, as expected form a furry type story there are an incredible amount of cute moments even without the 18+ patch.
Catgirl Harem Simulator 2015  + Pretty long story + The art is lovely and well done + Boob bounciness adjuster +1 + All achievements without effort + Chocola goes in heat + Vanilla goes in heat  - No path or dialogue choices in storyline anywhere   I took about 80+ screenshots. 10/10 would screenshot pantyshots again.
http://imouto.club/nekopara/ nude mod   10/10 game of the year.
The story is pretty good, the story is cute, the music is amazing, I cant wait for nekopara vol. 2
Nekos
Horny pastry puffer.  10/10
money, pussy(literly), imoutos. whats not to like
Didn't have the 18+  patch, had to use my imagination... Keep me away from balloon animals and shaving cream.
i enjoy the game its pretty good and easy that its simple not hard at ALL,  you click in a simple story set in a simple cafe with a strange cat girls  in japan ( the obvisuley  answer )the only thing is that .. the game has 12 chapters and took me 2 days to finsh it or you can finsh it in 1 it was long, i recommend the game if you like cat girls, cafe and a story line i think its more suitable for you  Oh what is that chapter i think 5 there a hidden chapter and its skiping the whole story  its a mod? there secrent and i have no idea how to do it?
I would reccomend this game to anyone. But not for the boobs or the sexual happenings. I reccomend this game for it's story.  Ok, Sure, I'll admit it.  I originally bought this game because of the catgirl maid pictures.  But once the story picked up i found myself not caring for that. The story of this game is 10 times better than what i had initially bought it for. The way the relationship between you and the catgirls grows as the game's story progresses is phenominal. I found myself tearing up at every emotinal moment as well as smiling at every happy one. This game is now one of my favourites in my library and I'll be playing the story over and over again.  10/10
This is the reason that we don't need girlfriend.
First TIme ever playing a game like this. This is for Research. Research. Re-Search. I must Re Search my Screen shots. OH GOD. Upload.... NO Big Mistake... or was..

plays pirated 18+ patch even though already bought the game on steam,   69/21 -IGN would pirate bought game again.   Also I skipped the a majority of the story just for the hentai, I couldn't give a fuck about any of the characters but chocola with her bewb physics and banira with her stare ジイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイ and quite simillar akwardness... I HAVE FIRNEDS TOOO YOU KNOW, that's why i bought this game instead of getting a GF.
I enjoyed this visual novel. i think the reactions is what really made me laugh on some of it. i think if you're open to stories then this one might be for you.
10/10.
Great game, my right arm is now 3cm thicker than my left arm. The game on steam is not the R18 version. But you can tweak the game by swapping some files from the original game. Just google it. It changed my life !
Want moa! Even tho there is vol.0. If you haven't already, press p in game... 10/10
love chocola <3 10/10
Normally, I hate cats. They're so lazy, sleep all days, demand for food, disturbing my midnight-time with their Thu'um. But, after I play this game, everytime I want to strike cat's head, I stroke [i]my[/i] head, instead.
I feel so weeby now... And. I. LOVE. IT.
Weeb trash.
I`m already a demon
my right hand hurts
One word: Nekos.

I think I've read better eroge on DeviantArt to be honest...  Stick around for the first 3 chapters. Writing quality drops off a cliff after that.
(Please remember this is all IMO) NEKOPARA Vol. 1 was a good read for me, It was enjoyable had it's lighthearted moments and it's Hevy moments. The Entire Story kept me entranced, Once I started reading, I found that I couldn't stop, and before I knew it I had read my way through the whole thing in the matter of about a day. The feels were acting up at every corner (I nearly went through a whole box of tissues.) The Characters were all so adorable, even if the protaganist was a little dense I can still count him in the line up, as well the animations were superb. I am in love with the story and can't wait for the next installment (seeing as how it was already confirmed.) I give NEKOPARA Vol. 1 a 10/10 I recomend this to lovers of reading (romantic novels mostly) Neko fans, and anyone that enjoys a good/cute story. .........FREAKING ADORABLEEEEEEE!!!!! (Again all IMO)
Cute story, cute girls! It's a shame it needs a patch (not available on Steam) to unlock the 18+ content though. ;<  vanilla confirmed best catgirl tho
This game has a good length, but it's deceptively empty. For all the claims of a 'great' story, it's mostly fanservice and build-up. Vol. 1 is an apt part of the title because it definitely doesn't feel complete. I think after finishing the storyline you're definitely going to be crying out, "BUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?", but that alone should tell you it's a pretty good game. I'm disappointed that the story didn't develop as much as I hoped it would, but I can't argue that I was delighted the whole time I was playing due to the colorful characters and the question of where everything was leading (although unsatisfactorily answered). As part of a series this is a great start, but woefully inadequate (especially compared to fantastic FREE novels like Katawa Shoujo) as a standalone VN.   But catgirls are fucking cute so 10/10.
good
I have no words bad to say about this game. None at all.
The game and story was great. Light and Bubbly... the only thing I found that was kinda uneeded rather ironically for a H-Visual Novel was the actual Hentai Scenes themselves. It seemed kinda forced onto a story that would've been fine without it, especially considering that they come so suddenly and out of nowhere that it actually slowed the story down in my opinion. (no pun intended) I guess due to this being Sayori's work however some hentai had to be somewhere.   Basically if you purchase this game to only reap the H-scenes... I'd suggest going to Google. You wont miss much at all. However if you want a light-hearted story with excellent artwork, music and satisfactory characters... you wont go far wrong with purchasing Nekopara.
who need girlfriend, when you have cute neko waifu 69/69 IGN~
I love this game. The soundtrack is great and I love the animation (Thx E-mate). Good character development and emotional attachment. There are some cliched characters but it's not much. Can't wait for Vol. 2  (Still waiting for the official soundtrack DLC.)  :)
like 10/10, nya~~
>Purchease the game >Install >Download 18+ Version >Extract >Lock the door >Faped a lot  HAPPY FAP SOLDIER !!! XD
Here's my first 20 minutes of gameplay. Masturbated furiously. Then stopped, read through some nice story. Masturbated furiously. Story. Masturbated furiously.  A game for all ages.
I won't lie. I love this game's art style, and find it somewhat cute, but at the end of the day that's really it. This game is just fucking clicking 24/7 on a boring ass story and it drives me insane, and the narration is like some shitty Fanfic that is trying to make filler by goddamn explaining how the floor looks. And yes, for shits and giggles I installed the 18+ version, and still, it just doesn't make it a viable game. If the sex is bad in a game meant as a Fap off to game, it's bad. 2/10 is the rating. Dear lord above forgive me for playing this game.
I will name my cat chocola and vanilla when they are born soon!~ I'm going to feed them alot of tiramisu! -pets pets- (｡◕‿◕｡)  Good Soundtrack ✓ Beautiful Art ✓ Sad and Happy moments ✓ Characters love you so much ✓ Cant resist Cuteness ✓ Nosebleed ✓  Kawaii/10   More cats coming soon~  Sometime u wish fantasy to be real this game is one of those fantasy~
Gotta love them all ~~~
some things you need to have before playing -anime spirit  -nekocon -moecon -some perverted eyes(misc.) -2 box of tissue(for the awesomeness you know :D)  warning................just play the game :D really good 9/10
A fantastic VN  While on the light side (around 4 hours) and zero choices to make, it's still a very engrossing story about a guy and his two adorable catgirl twins.  The Sprites are animated spectacularly -- they will actually walk up in your face, run, switch places and leap out of the frame.  If you like catgirls, this one is for you.    Vanilla best grill
I love the story of this game, funny and cute, I also love the music, and I also love the badges/emoticons/backgrounds that you can get from Nekopara, they are the best, I use them a lot! :nekoheart: :vanilla: :nekoheart:
Its actually got a pretty decent story is you bother to read it and the engine is game uses is the best I've ever seen for a VN as the characters move and look around rather than just been a still sprite picture. There isn't really anything dirty in the steam version but if you really *need* the missing scenes you can *acquire* them fairly easily and patch them in so you still get achieves and cards.
Great Arm strengthener!  10/10, +1 for R18 version making it 11/10.
My pants flew off.
Kinetic VN are getting more and more amazing. This one is more like playing an anime than most.  If you like anime this is the game for you. It's colourful, lovely and surprisingly story rich albeit a bit brief.  You play Kashou the most alpha male super baker in all of Japan and live in a world where some god among men scientists have created geneticly engineered cat girls. Where all of them even your underage sister is magneticly attracted to you.  These cat girls are like real girls but better in everyway. They're cute, submissive, have the IQ of a primary school girl, cute and despite being barely a step above real house cats are perfectly being happy being locked up in a home or use at a non breeding slave. Sounds like heaven right?  The cakes you make as a baker give girls orgasms and your family is so rich buying and opening a bakery in your name by yourself is chump change.  These cat girls which cost obviously more money than actual cats in food, hair care and clothing that your middle school sister owns 6 of them. Many of which are only 1-4 years old and have the fully devellopped bodies of girls in their teens and late teens.  You (Kashou) and your 9 month old 14-15 year old bodied cat girls in skimpy outfits run La Soileil, A bad french grammar bakery where you exploit your cat girls Chocola and Vanilla to dance around cutely and sell cups of sugar to suckers for insane prices.   Chocola is a low IQ brunette with bigger emotional ups and downs than an amusement park ride and Vanilla a stone faced albino.      Ok Joking aside it's a damn good VN and has alot to give. No choices in dialog and it's just an anime with no male VAs when set to autoplay. This version has no sex scenes in it and 100% honest to god truth, doesn't even need any. I'm serious, this could stand alone as just a story about cute girls with some lewd-ish moments. The characters are well voiced and it's an interesting world to catch a glimpse of.  The art is spectacular to watch and having it animated in a kinetic VN is better than nearly all before it. This isn't a new concept but it's nice and about damn time stuff like this comes to the west.
I have not even gotten the chance to play. WHen I try to startthe game there is a message that pops up in mostly japanese, buti can read something about direct X. I am almost certain that I have have dirext x installed. someone help :(
i love you chocola
Cute catgirls galore.
Neko <3
My dream to cosplay as a L4D2 charger can happen now :)
Buy this.... Play this... Then never buy another novel again.
My favourite VN so far!! I mean the art alone.... And not to mention my kawaii waifus :33
♥ so cute ♥ love it!! ♥
This game is perfect for people how like anime plus neko mimin (cat girls) and the story, graphic, and even the voice actors were perfect
If you want to feel like the proud adopted dad of two catgirls who want your "D" this is the game for you! Seriously though, it is a sweet game with genuine heart. It does have awkward moments which take from the experience, but more often then not you will feel the love of two adorable kittens who love your face.
Parents told me to stop watching Hentai all the time, so I bought this game and told them it's not hentai...It's softcore porn. Little do they know that I have a certain patch installed, therefore this game is a masterpiece 10/10
Finally I can be accepted for who I am.
After playing this game for a very long time, I can confidently say it is very good. I play it every night right before bed.   If you want the full experience, download the 18+ patch.
The sweetness made me teeth hurt, and I'm not talking about the cakes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I had a roomate. Really close friend. Every night we had been playing Dota together. Got into party and play ranked. It was such a nice combo and teamwork.  Then I see this "Nekopara". Hmm.. For changing pace and relaxing from Dota, it looked like a nice game. So I bought it. And I play it on the night.  There was a scene that Chocola and Vanilla doing great work, and I (main character) had to pat their head. Then suddenly my roomate went in, seeing me smilng unnaturally while seeing two cute cat girls on the PC monitor. My left hand was on the keyboard and the right hand was in the position that I was so difficult to explain what happened.  Now we're living in separated rooms. He never invite me Dota party anymore - even barely talk to me. So sad.  But whatever. I had to. Chocola and Vanilla are something I can't deny :D:
We need more boingboing.
a cat is fine too
GETTING THAT PUSS - YCAT  10/10
change language for achievements simulator      more later
The only reason why buy this stuff is. restoration patch  yes i'm a pervert i feel like king of harem  10/10 would f*ck neko girls again
Sorry weebs on steam.  I didn't like this visual novel very much.  I mean, if you're looking for moe* and cheesy shit, this is the visual novel for you. It just lacked plot and basically it was just about catgirls wanting to get down with you. Sounds hot right?  ... Yeah, steam version didn't include all that HAHA  PERSONALLY I didn't enjoy it. But hey, like I said, if you're into moe and cheesy things, this is for you! (Sorry prophet. LOLOLOL.)  (Dude, the cat-girls are literally a year old. They look around 16 but they're literally a year old.)  *cute/endearing. Definition for non-anime fans.
670 hours in and i still have not even made it to the first sleeping scene
Nice graphic and story line. Recomended for them whos like cat. Especially in Catgirl Humanoid wearing a Maid cloth.   http://ryanliem.blogspot.com/2015/03/nekopara-surga-kucing.html
you will never need a girlfriend again  11/10 also nekos~
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 takes place in the cafe La Soleil that Kashou has moved out to open on his own. Nekos if that word pleases you buy this game. The story has many feels that will make you fall in love with your two beloved nekos. Steam doesnt have the 18+ version but do yourself a favor if your going to get this game and download it. Make sure to lock your door behind you turn steam to offline and enjoy the feels. (─‿‿─)
the best vn technology
11/10 Stock up some tissues, you'll need it.
11.9/10, your dreams of living with a nekogirl come true, still waiting on a vr verison ;)
First of all, in case you might not know yet, the Steam version of Nekopara is censored. If you're looking for erotic pictures of catgirls, this is not where you'll find them. If, however, you are looking for a heartwarming story backed up by charming characters and stunning graphics, then this game is perfect for you.  	Nekopara's story is simple and straightforward, with no multiple choices or endings. If you thought you'd have to choose between one of the 2 main catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, don't worry: You get 2 for the price of comparing every real life girl you ever fall in love with to cats for the rest of your life.  	The lack of any kind of player input doesn't, however, detract from the story. What could have been just about any kind of tale with girls who inexplicably have cat ears and tails, instead turned out to be a well-crafted narrative that will leave you craving for more. The fact that the catgirls display a significant variety of real cat behavior, instead of just acting cute for the sake of acting cute, should by itself speak volumes about how much went into making the story the best it could be.  	Alongside the well written story are a gorgeously adorable art style and great voice acting, all of which come together to make lovable, talking, moving and breathing characters with varied personalities, emotions, likes and dislikes, to which its incredibly easy to get genuinelly emotionally attached. That said, Chocola is my immaculate little angel, and all filthy perverts who dare lay a finger on her shall be publicly castrated*. >:v  	If you REALLY must have the censored scenes in your game, you can obtain the uncensored version by other means, such as the official Nekopara website. If you have both steam and original versions, you can even patch the original scenes into the steam version... ... ... I won't judge you... ... ... [strike]I will judge you immensely[/strike]*.

An in-depth case study of what happens to the human mind when exposed to background radiation and industrial pollution for extended periods of time. If this documentary does not make you flinch and feel unwell, I might wish to introduce you to my fine German-engineered shower. It is made from genuine nazi steel, you see.
I may or may not have forgot to review this game a while ago, but it doesn't really matter i guess. I like this story and game, it is cute my mind will explode. On the reality side, the devs did a good job putting this together and i enjoyed it. Honostly. :3
Good +Nekos +Meow +Nekos  fap 10\10
Have you ever wanted something like friends or to do something with your life. Welp too bad. Toss those dreams out the window and dedicate every waking second of your life to nekopara. I mean what good is getting a job or finishing school gonna do when you have two (Underaged... er.... young?)  catgirl waifus at home who you could be fucking i mean training to work at your patisserie that you opened and moved to because you hate your parents for not appreciating you saving them money by dropping out of highschool to hole up in your room and watch anime, play games, and do questionable things. Then you can watch your waifus mature (get more horny) and become fine grown catgirls because of your hard work and efforts. (aka you sexed them both)
"La Soleil Patisserie"  - Cute catgirls - Lovely atmosphere - Enjoyable VN  Recommended if you like catgirls ;)
This game is purrfect
Love the BGM, it is so relaxing <3 322/10
awesome game :3 i now want my own chocola and vanillla
Ayye. So this'll be my first review (I know, on a game like this, I'm starting on the right foot), but I'd like to try to correctly inform others about this game, so let's go over pros and cons.  Pros: +Has nekos +Has girls +Has kawaii neko girls +Vol. 1 suggests that there is a second (or maybe more) volume  ̶ᴄ̶ᴜ̶ᴍ̶ᴍ̶ɪ̶ɴ̶ɢ̶  coming +HAS NEKOZ +The 18+ is... Oh my  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) +Makes friends question you, which in turn helps strengthen true friendships... (and burns down most other ones...) +Feel manly as Steam announces to all of your friends that you are playing a manly ass game +IT ****ING HAS NEKOZ DAMNIT, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?  Cons: -Doesn't have enough Nekos... QQ  Things I'm iffy on: /Can't really interact much with the other nekos and focuses on the 2 (which itself isn't a bad thing) /The fact that there is 2 $@!TD*^$# (18+ patch)  All in all, ayy lmao.
For the low price, you can "nyaaa~" yourself to a permanent :3 face with tons of cuteness. Although apparently no character in this game knows how Graphic Design works, because those business cards are really ugly. (The store is nice, but I guess he can't handle Photoshop) I like to turn chest bounciness down just so it looks natural, otherwise the bounce physics go all over the place with such a small area to move.
This game was so awkward that i had to get Shia Labeouf to help me out on this one. Just what am i playing?         Still a great game dou10/10
It's difficult to write a review of such an overwhelmingly positive game, since being fair is relevant hard enough, meow.  The key feature of the game is "very cute", cute enough to dissolve your heart with eye-candies like Chocola and Vanilla.  It made me wish to have a catgirl accomplishes my daily task in Japan. Meow? How come? And yet, it's definitely a common feeling from a lot of us.  Other than that, I am not very sure how to comment it as a visual novel. The length of the story is fairly short { about 8 hours for average gameplay, and I guess we are dying for more }, the story itself is not very...memorable: it's a boy leaves his home for the 1st time trying to make a living by opening a bakery shop himself along with 2 catgirls by his side.   However, with 50% off, I believe it is a no-mistaken strawberry cake that is worth grabbing even just for purely leisure. It is also recommended for the people who's taking a break from big titles like I am. Meow! Meow! Meow!  Scarlet Score: 8.5/10
It's Sayori's original characters stepping onto the visual novel stage! The artwork and production values are as high as expected. The novel uses the e-mote system which allows for animations with full CG quality. The story itself is somewhat simplistic but fairly adorable. If you're looking for branching paths or any form of gameplay, though, there are none. It's a few hours of story and considering it's one of the very few high quality from-Japan VNs on Steam right now, it's well worth the $10, IMO.   It needs to be noted that there are two versions of this VN, though. The Steam version is the all-ages version with the sex scenes cut out. The 18+ version is only available from DLsite but it costs twice as much so there is a trade-off. If you want more info about the 18+ version, you can probably find it on the Community Hub.
NEKO ............ NEKO EVERYWHERE    and s**, occasionally  BUT NEKO AND CATPANIONS EVERYWHERE
One of the best 7 hours of my life  My rating?  Vanilla/Chocola would go offline again
and they say 3D girl is better than 2D  11/10
Cute enough for character, have funny story lot that can make you laugh sometimes but the best scene is R-18 scene which I love it :D
I have only played 5 minutes of it and I already love it!  I can't wait for the other volumes 10/10
Perfect game except for one thing...          needs more maple.
Well this isnt much of a game to be honest... Its more of a visual noval, kind of like watching a show. But it's enjoyable to watch the whole 'game' as it features well crafted characters and more. I'll just put it in a simple and concise sentence. A visual novel of a baker who ran away from home with two cat girls that originally belonged to his sister who are undergoing puberty. As you can see from my few hours of playing, this game doesnt take long. But still... Worth the price though
I-I-It's not like I l-like it or anything... B-baka!
This is a wonderfully made game, with a lot of effort and time put into this, and it shows. The games characters are made perfectly for what they are. I've just beat the game for the first time, and I'm at a loss for words. The voice acting is in Japanese, yes, but it was all made very well. The only thing I can say more is this: I can't wait until vol. 2 is released. I would say the next game, but seeing as how it comes out tomorrow whenever I write this, I don't have to wait long, but that ending! Absolutely amazing! If you like VNs, if you like things that are a bit different, if you like romance stories (I use this 'if' lightly), then you will probably like this game. I laughed at times, was at the verge of tears sometimes, confused at times, was intrigued at times, and I love this game to death.
Best novella I've ever played. 10 catgirls out of 10.
The hentai is good, specially with the +18 patch, but the narrative is just mediocre and the rythm painfully slow, also the main idea is pretty stupid.
cat girls 10/10  patch the r-18 version boys
Chocola.. Vanilla.. <3 But Maple is the best girl <3 <3  Buy it and love your cat[strike]girl[/strike]  Nekopara/100
Nice game if you like cats. I wish there is a sequel to this.
Needs more catgirls  Meow/10
disgusting really really disgusting
Chest Bounciness. 11/10
let me fulfill my fantasies of wanting to fuck cats  chocola is best girl
If you like Visual Novels, this one is absolutely adorable! I love the voices for each character and the story is heart warming. If you are the type that likes cat-girls, I would definietly recommend this game then.
This is a amazing game. If you're looking for some sweaty college locker-room action, then maybe you'd be better suited at Tumblr. This game makes you fall in love with the characters, with funny, and emotional moments so powerful, I actually cried a few times. I reccomend this for anyone looking for a amazing story to fall into and love.
[b]Catgirls.[/b] That isn't enough?  [b]Cute[/b] catgirls. [b]Six[/b] cute catgirls. Six cute catgirls [b]and an imouto.[/b]  Seriously, it's a very light visual novel. Good read for some good time and destressing-- tired from work, maybe when you want to take a break from a heavy grind, or got stuck from another game's puzzle. Don't expect, however, for hardcore gameplay/interaction.
No regrets.
i lost a bet i didnt buy this  swear pls dont judge me im doing to regain my honor
Terrible game. Why did brendan gift this to me, story is shit
I thought it was pretty funny the way Chocola and Vanilla (mainly Vanilla) reacted to things, as well i really enjoyed the story, also lets be honest boobs aren't bad either.
A very well made and polished VN (Visual Novel).  ~A story of a Baker and his 2 pet Nekomimis (Catgirls)~  I never was into visual novels but he linked me this. It was okay considering voice acting, animations, music and chest boun...ci...ness...? "Oohh, it's one of those VNs..." This kind of harem story line is a clïche almost in any Visual and/or Anime. It's popular so go with the flow.  Since it's a Novel of a Visual sensation it features text. And alot of it. If you are here to collect rather expensive steam cards you'll be clicking through this game. If you are a person who likes deep reading, catching character desing and story this is for you.  ~Possible spoiler alert~ Least into 3 hours of auto-advancing things start to "heat up". And what do I mean by this...? As Cpt. Pickard would say: "Set course for Intercourse.  Would I recommend? Yes. I never experienced A VN proper than this. And I didn't care about the "intercourse" the story and the characters are the key here. Funny and sad at the times had me on a rollercoaster of emotions.
Well, there're several steps you need to take before playing this game. 1. Buy it without any hesitation. 2. Close any applications which may take up the bandwidth of your network and download it with full speed.  3. Make sure that the doors and curtains of your room are tightly shut. 4. Set Steam Friend status to Offline. 5. Get a nice pair of headphone. 6. (Optional) Prepare a roll of tissue in case of need. 7. (Optional) If you are over 18 years old, you can also get yourself a physical/digital copy of 18X version, which may contain many...eh... enjoyable elements. 8. Get yourself seated and adjust your pose to a comfortable one. 9. Click Play button gently. Besides, if you have any trouble unlocking achievements, please visit forums for help.  Oh, and one more warning, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING ANYTHING IN THE GAME OUT IN THE REAL WORLD! Or... you'll regret that... (you know what I mean ^_^)  Strongly recommended! An Essential Purchase for anime lovers!
If you like Catgirls and Anime games like Visual Novel you will realy like this game and with the Uncut Patch its a realy good game
I got a bj from a catgirl within an hour, along with catgirl incest. I also awkwardly stared my cat in the eyes during the sex...  10/10 for plot.
Yeah, i bought it haha.  I've always heard about these games, and seen little snippets on the web so I had to try it.  Turns out it's really just a short visual novel (and I say novel in the lightest since possible) with no really game to be had in it.  There are no wrong or right choices.  You just keep clicking the next button until it's over.  Then you just forget you ever played it, and when your friends see your game list they say "Dude you actually played this.", and you say "Played what?  Oh, yeah...meh."
I sold a Coconut card for 30 cents.   10/10 its a masterpiece
Im happy that there is enough people with hatred for me to gift me this game.
It's ok. Visual novels aren't usually my thing, but it was on sale and a friend said to get it. He liked the boob bounce slider thingy. I've gone through better stories, personally, but there is an amount of charm to this one.  If you want a charming experience with catgirls. Get it.
Great game.Story is ok art style is cool.Characters are interesting.
It has cute cat girls and very important options like chest bounciness.
Catpanions... Thx japan :3   ~Like 3 hours to 100%.
This vn made me turn away from god and started my long journey down to sin and catgirls.
Nice game, recommend :D
DON'T LUST YOUR CAT.   # 9/10 # Greatstory  . # Kawaii // I want to pet them all. MEOWWWWW!!!!!!! . # AND A LITTLE SERVICE !!! /////  just a little okay!!!
Neko ! Neko ! and Neko !  Nyan !!!!!! Nyannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ! Nyan !
neko neko neko-san ;3
Good game, story, cute character, seiyuu^^
Curious to get my hands on playing by getting it at a cheap price, seen nekos and stuff, never looked back on getting it :D
つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ADD RUSSIA LANGUAGE PLZ  つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
keeps you entertained.
gud
why i dont get any emotes or cards? finished it already
I have brought dishonour to my family. I have been disowned. I have brought great shame to everyone.    10/10 would patch again.
Good Story, Better story if u download the r18 story( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I loved this! The amimation is done really well and the voice acting doesn't make me want to kick a puppy. 3 hours well spent.
really cute game for all catgirl lovers or just people looking for something to read.
Actually I can't believe that I'm really writing this, but... DO NOT INSTALL R-18 PATCH! When I've started playing I was like, teeheee, ecchi stuff with nekos, nyaaa! I like lewd, little girls with cat ears, so I NEED that patch. :3 After first few hours of playing this game I was completly charmed. Drawings and animations - really good work, cute and pretty like... Well, like loli catgirl. Voices - exquisite voice actors, as I excepted. But story... Well, that's a reason I DO NOT reccomend to install patch. Story is so damn warm, cute and heartmelting. I was totally drowned in that warm, sweet caramel narration. And then... FOLY HUCK! All that cozy and sweet atmosphere was TOTALLY RUINED by this goddamn erotic scene. ;_;        Still made me hard, 11/10. Cinnamon ====> waifu
Silly anime catgirl fun.  Some feels and plenty of high and lows if you like this sort of thing, and I do.
Do you like Nekomimis? Yes? Well then you know, buy the game!
Story is practically non-existant, nice art and engine I guess but not very good for anything else. 5/10
From a girl's point of view ; I thought the storyline was pretty solid, it had a plot and a solution. The costume and graphics are amazing.
#ITS NOT A HENTAI
I was gifted it and now i look like a sexual deviant 11/10
The most amazing shit i have played in my whole life, Must buy 10/10 game of the year.
Neko Paradise
First few hours and I'm tearing up like a vag, nice. Guess I'll keep playing and add more later. Thank's for showing me I'm a real puss game, really appreciate that.
3USD for ero... oh no no this is not eroge!! :3   Yes this is not eroge if you didn't use some patch Shhhhhhh. Listen men if you buy this that's means you has been complete to buy a great eroge in 3USD! Conglat gentleman.  Okay let's see my review after i played an original version.   This game have a lot of very beautiful CG in game. And so much of Neko mimi girls. Yes! You will loved it Trust me!!!  and uh...  oh yeah, however i recommend all of you to patch this game after buy this on steam fufufu.  Props + Nice and great CG + Nice character movement in conversation page + Nice Seiyuu/Cast Voice + Neko mimi girls~~~~~~~ + Easy to patch with go for 18+ version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Cons - you may little boring if didn't get patch ufufufu  And i give this on.... 9.5 out of 10  Don't forget to buy i've warned you!
Gotta love Cat+Girl hybrid~!  P.S: There is an 18+version in the net and how to patch it.  11/10
i have 0 regrets.   goodbye real life ~
Better than CSGO
hahaha to add to the overwhelming positive GG!
Well, ok, so there IS a reason that justifies me buying this game.  Boob. Jiggle. Slider.  12/10 would jiggle again
VOLUME TWO NOW PREPARING PLEASE WAIT WARMINGLY.  Its true, right!? RIGHT!?
I regret this.
I never played this
Before: "omg omg cute catgirl maids kyaa! Such great reviews. So many hours. Such promising description." After: "oh... is.. is there ever going to be any sort of a choice...? wait why did he just say they're like daughters to him... he's going to bang his pet-slash-daughter catgirls..? and she kinda behaves like a little child, that's.. not as cute as I expected...."  Bottom line: if you just want to see sex that involves catgirls, buy it outside of steam because censorship. The art is great, the animations are definitely above average for a VN and it has boob physics (and a slider to go with that!). But if you want to get it for the story... yeah no. Unless you're into awkwardly childish and simple-minded catgirls involved in psychological incest (they're not related but they're like his daughters, after all).  I'd still have played it if it at least had some choices to make the player more involved with the story and to make them care more about the characters and what happens :(
cat girls in a café, what is there not to like? (8/10)  (10/10 for 18+ patch if you're a perv)
It's so cute >w<
In my country there's a saying "Don't buy a pig in a bag", which means that you should always make sure you know what exactly you are buying.. ..So I got cats in a box. Worth it!
It was a gift!
I wanna break my dick off in Chocola's butt.
The game is 100% KAWAII  Total Kawaii Overload  so fvcking kawaii that you will die! the graphics are awesome! 100 FPS
Reminds me a lot of Her, since you play as Joaquin Phoenix and are dating two pieces your property; But is neither deep nor thoughtprovoking. Poor Demo. I wish him the best of luck in future streaming endevours.
Best VNovel for Nekomimis lovers. Good art, good voice acting and not-that-bad written story
Awwwwwww... Those catgirls are sooooo cute, loving this so much so far!!! Will add more as I play.
I came for nekos, I got the nekos. Best game of all time, would fap again. #ChocolaBestGirl
This is an excellent steam Visual Novel. This one is of the "no choices" variety, so it's very relaxing and casual. E-mote and the art style come together perfectly here and will keep your eyes busy. Voice acting is terrific, even if you don't speak japanese. Good music to boot.  Humor, drama, sex... welcome to nekopara!
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Boobs bounciness sliders. nuff said
Nekopara: A Japanese Visual Novel (VN) which explores the intimate relations between catgirls and humans and the complex interworking’s of pimping Nekos in a free market  economy during a recession. The story delves into Kashou’s (main character) recent life experiences; a self-absorbed baker who is struggling to reclaim his independence while soaking up the love and affection from Nekos that pine for his attention. Struggling to gets his business going, Kashou must also navigate through the complex nature involved with raising and understanding two needy catgirls that fight for his attention, all while coming to terms with the fact that he finds his neko “daughters” sexually attractive. When the endless flirting no longer “cuts it” for the master of Chocola and Vanilla (Nekos), he pursues a more intimate relationship with the catgirls. Despite the increasing acceptance of “catpanions” in Japan, Kashou (your character), struggles to accept his fetishes and publicly acknowledge his relations with this sex crazed kitten girls. This 7-9 hour game leads up to a fun filled day at an amusement park and a night full of scandalous, pleasure driven, raunchy, boner popping, cream filled sex leaving Kashou feeling emptied, tired, slightly dizzy, and running a mild fever. This of course sends your Nekos into a full tilt panic driven meltdown culminating in a mild conflict with an incompetent rent-a-cop guarding the outside of a random pharmacy where they girls sought medicine for Kashou’s weak ass immune system. After drinking some Nightquil and a day of rest, Kashou awakens to find that all 5 nekos and his incest driven baby sister all dressed up as maids willing to exploit themselves for Koashou’s profit. If you’re into prostitution, incest, Nekos, and a fair amount of kwai, than this game is for you.   Pros: •	Voice acting is decent •	Coconut and Maple are actually proportionate and good looking •	The art is pretty solid, decent gameplay length •	Neko Kitties/titties  Cons: •	Gameplay length  •	Incest •	Gender exploitation •	Prostitution  •	Predictable outcomes/situations and dialog
I thought it would be funny to get the R18+ patch.  Do not get the R18+ patch.
10/10 Has boob bounciness option Only thing you need in life
i touched my peepee to drawings of cats  11/10
apparently spamming 'P' was not the way to advance the plot.
There are crusty tissues scattered allover my desk
Lots of Neko's. 669 hours of my life well spent.
Well, as a professor researching anime females such as their sizes and such. This game is quite a great game to use as research material. I have patched in the 18+ files making my research even easier. Though for some reason my research tends to get wet making it hard to continue on, but I manage all in due time.
"Like Skyrim but cats" - IGN  10/10
Had a threeway with two cat girls. THEN took them on a date....  10/10 would love neko girls again
The animation, the voice acting, the story were are amazing. The nekos. The ears. The tails.  its a gift bestowed on us from the neko gods.
Finds catgirls in boxes Brings them home Ends up in bed with them 10/10 best game I've ever experienced nya~!! ^~^
18+ PATCH:http://imouto.club/nekopara/
I like this game.
When i Played this game, this is just amazing and well worth the MONEY IT HAS A CHEST BOUNCINESS SETTING AND PRESSING "P" JUMPS THE NEKOGIRLS AND THE BOOB MOVES BEST GAME EVER 10/10
just a porno novel of a guy who has sex with cats
10/10 It has somthing for everyone.
Not even an hour and I love it, 10/10. Really good game if you lookin to bust some quick nuts.
The game is cute and fun! Innuendo's and cat gags all around, it's actually entertaining and full of moments you will laugh at or maybe even tear up a bit. If you like visual novels, get this one. :D
Steam allows pornographic screenshots of the 18+ version. Game/10.
Gorgeous game. It may look like nothing outstanding in terms of character creation or story but it's a solid VN with tons of fun. The best aspect of this is that animation and descriptions are great. It is really easy to get into this game and spend a lot of time in it. Voices are sweet as they should be.  Soo as simple as that it goes really high in my personal list of comedy VN with ecchi elements. AND SOO THERE GOES THE HENTAI SCENES - well uncensored ekhem... There is a lot to look at.
Ok, this isn't really a game.  It's a motion comic.  In enhanced 2D or 32D, whups, I mean 3D.  The comic interacts by allowing you to continue at your own pace and when you move the window, the characters interact with the movement of the window - very meta.  For the first hour or more of the game, you'll be like WTF did I just buy ?  It's a story about a bloke, who opens a shop, and tries to make a profi...  oh to hell with it.  NAKED FREAKIN CATGIRLS. gagging for it.  (ps, as evryone esle says, install the "patch" on top of the steam version)
Nekos.
you need some serious BALLZ to play this game! 68/69 would sleep with again
very fun very cute game 20 out of 10
If it was possible to get diabetes from a game this one would be the culprit.  It's too adorable.  A guy can use the word adorable, right?
I never wanted kill myself more than i do now.
[i]Catgirls are kawaii[/i] [i]Your dick hardens, heart softens[/i] [i]Buy and enjoy, perv.[/i]
what the heck is this?   The story is extremely shallow, why is this classified as a visual novel with positive reviews?
With every completion of NEKOPARA, It further proves my masculinity. I made you proud dad.
Loved it! Cute and amazing waiting for 2nd part <3
u need the H option!!!
So much waifu's.. No Waifu No Laifu!
Started the game. Closed the game. Downloaded R18 version. Relaunched the game. After about an hour in I was out of tissues, and after four more hours I found myself laying in a pool of my own semen and tears. I’m going to give it a 9/10 for making me need a shower.
Two words, FUCKING AWESOME! This game fills up the void in my heart, since i am only a single male dog.
I was almost thinking of giving this product a negitive  revew . I felt that might be unfair considering that the product does seem to  supply everything it promised  and they do provide a demo for you.   I was   disapointed that  it had no mechanism for you to interact  in any way with the characters .  But for the $12   you read  the  book while looking  at the  pictures and listening to the voice acting all of wich is in  a language other than engish either Japanese or  Chinese     if  after you have purchased the  visual novel .  you decide to  get the 18 + pach  which i recomend you do as  the fact that he has sex with the two cat girls changes there relationship and the story . there are  three  scenes with nudity in them .Two of which are sexual the other one he is just bathing them.  I would not purchase this for the  porographic content. As there is not much of it .I found it more funny than erotic but thats maybe just me.   But it is a cute and funny  visual novel  i got a couple of good laughs out of it so for $12 not bad .     some of the other revewers have made  Reference to the anemi terms  nekos  and lols   nekos  are  anime  characters that have cat like charactersitcs   ie cat girsl  lols  are   anime  characters that  are  like young girls .  which makes sense as all the female characters are child like  and it is about cat girls.     here are the wikipedia  links that explain this termonlogy   lols  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon     necos   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgirl   before you purchase this here is my recomendations  1 look at the company websight see what type of content they make the link is in the store page .   2 download the demo and try it out  .
I swear on me mum I only play this for he complex plot.
holy shit moving, bouncing cat girls i have seen the future of vn what a time to be alive
this is a great dating sim! the art and graphics are amazing and I love the use of emofuri for the animated interactions between the characters. Not only are the characters cute and likeable but there are many different varieties to choose from!
i need no life now, for that i have my beautiful genetically modified cats also know as "nekos" =))
This is my life now.....
Super cute game awesome animation  who needs a life when you have Cholat and Vanilla The novel its self is quite short but cant wait for the next volume :D Nekos  what more could you want??
I cannot remember why I own this game, but I do not like it. I will recommend it because if you are reading this review, it is likely that this game is your cup of tea anyway. Maybe do not buy this game for yourself, I didn't. If you can find a friend and have them buy it for you, and you buy it for them, neither of you have to own up to buying it, and that feels more morally sound. But I cannot even finish the game, so I am not even sure how bad it gets.
11/10  pro : I will not saying too much for this game. Loli & Catgirls <3  con :  its sad because i only able to play this game at midnight. (too many peoples around my room at day~evening)   ps : you can manage to get r18+ patch for steam version for free (you can search it in internet and follow the instructions there). happy fappi... i mean playing.
"Do you recommend this game ?"  Unbeliveably beautiful neko girls with hentai patch ?! YES, OF COURSE ! BUY IT, DON'T THINK !
I recommend this to every single person who would do any of the following:  -Like cute stuff -Would fuck a cat -Like weird noises when you have headphones on -Like bounce physics -And last but not least, would have sex with cats  P.S.  Press P to shake the screen bb
If you want to know the secrects of this game, hold down the Control key and you'll be fine other than that, this game is ok
Well it's a singleplayer game, so you play with yourself.
Catgirls are love. Catgirls are life.  Ain't gonna get a girlfriend in real life when I have catgirls to love.  69/10, totally straight person here.
Helped me discover my manhood ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°).
someones about to walk in  :c  I say deal with it, I continuee  nuff said  10/10   p.s steamy version should be available on steam pl0x
Buy this for hours of....of.....Fun?
Good game, super kawaii :D
I Love this visual Novel it's my favorite from animation, to the story, and the characters are just too adorable!! <3
Can play with one hand. 10/10
I adore all the girls in this game ♥
Chocola best girl <3
[strike]Changed my life.[/strike]  Seems alright.
I didn't expected the scenes where ####### was ####### with the ######## ####### that ########## it lasted ########## ####### ####### ######### ###################################################################  my only question is...where is the rest of the ####### volume?
I Need This IN My LifE GIVE ME THE NEKOs
Okay Despite all the silly reviews about this game I only have to say this game is pretty well made, got heartwarming moments and made me tear a bit.  I do got the R-18 version as well and it was a good choise but trust me I saw enough hentai so this is nothing new.  Pros: + Awesome music + Cute characters + Nice story + Well animated at some points + Flashbacks made me tear ;_; + Chest Bounciness + Weeaboo Paradise with lots of Catgirls + It got (If you do it right) H-Scenes what are *cough* delicious *cough* + Press P ;)  Cons: - Can't say it has downsides. The game is too good to have any. - Well maybe at some points i got little fps-issues but that's all.   TL;DR: Buy the game if you're an otaku/anime/manga/hentai/catgirl/personwithnoreallife, it's worth its money. For the R-18 patch look under the guides tab.
If I could put this game into two words it'd be: Jiggle Physics
NEKOPARA!!! Come for the cute anime Catgirls, stay for the existential crisis when you realize someone genetically modified cats to look like humans and then made them slaves. And then come to terms with the internal anguish of having to justify ownership of another sentinent being as not actually a problem.
Nyan.  Cats and breasts.  If you're not into that, there's an actual story. Like, it's not a "Do I say 'YO!' or 'Hello, nice to meet you.' kind of visual novel. It's what a visual novel should be by looking at the words "Visual" and "Novel". As in, a novel with visual aids to help in the immersion and overall feeling of the story. It's pretty fun if you see it like that. And just like any good book, it'll borrow 3-7 hours of your time that won't be regretted.  Do I want more people to buy this VN?  Yes.  Should you buy this VN?  I dunno, it's not free, and I sure as hell ain't in your shoes to decide what you should and shouldn't buy without considering the possibilities and outcomes of siblings, organ issues, family issues, love life, taste in chocolate, and many other things that construct your personality and nature throughout life.  If you came into my house demanding a refund, would I be furious and confused?  Absolutely.
A game meant to be played with an ice cold beer, friends, and tissue boxes.
A wondeful game where neko girls are real and  bestiality is ok
Bouncy bouncy bouncy bwoing bwoing bwoing, press p to bounce.
I swear I got this as a gift. 11/10
if you want cute background noise and adorable characters, then this is the game if you want interaction on any level and tits nah son
Loved this game, super adorable! Love the animation/art style and the characters were so easy to fall in love with.（*’∀’人）♥
I now have more active use for my "P" key.
Not recommended for users with moe allergy.
Hours well spent
A cat is fine too.  10/10
It said it had a chest bounciness setting.  It indeed did have a chest bounciness setting.
Minor pros: Good translation, fluent animation, awesome story. Major pros: Catgirls, Chest bounciness setting. Cons: Shouldn't be played in public places / work.
In the world of Nekopara you own genetically modified cats girls. Catgirls in this game are considered pets desite having human intelligence and do not have any rights or freedoms, which in my opinion raises all sorts of issues ranging from the morality of genetically modifying humans/cats to Modern slavery.
im 16 and i like 2 draw. me friend got this 4 me birthday. this game is solely just 4 art studies. anatomy. and moe art.  my parents dont question me on nood scenese becuz its art!!!11 they kno i lik to draw a lot game is perfect for those who enjoy art and loves to study anatomy. add on the free 18+ version of the game 2 study even more anatomy
when i first got nekopara i was a bit hesitant to play this game.  what will i find? will my parents disown me?  and how can i get both girls at the same time?  well my friends i can give you the answers to my questions,  kawaii neko girls is what i found,  yes my parents disowned now i live in the ghetto,  the last one well.... you'll just have to find out for yourself.    i used to be an atheist until i found out i was a neko sex god
i hope mai waifu is real :(
I need more Volumes! MORE!!!
oh yes, Im really feeling it
1000/10
I lost my manliness playing this game.   I had to install 18+ content files to feel manliness again. 11/10
i suddenly become a ninja when i bought this game x3   yes im a girl and yes i love hentai anime x3   MEOW~! :3
It had settings for breast bounciness, there's cat girls, and it's a pretty decent visual novel, good story. 8/10. Who am I kidding? 9/10 just for that breast bounciness settings.
Nekopara is a realistic simulation of a scenario of a world where the human race finshed the experiments and got the power to create Catgirls which are willing to do everything for their masters. In this world they are pets, workers and sexpartners. The main character gets two Catgirls to take care of and this is the beginning of the wonderfull story of Chocolate and Vanilla.  This game is full of "Love" and shows a special bound of owner and pet.  Im greatfull to have so gud friends that gifted me this game for birthday. After purchasing this game u actually need no life anymore because you can easily spend time with Chocolate and Vanilla .  Rate dis game 10/10 waiting for the 2. Episode <3
Dear god, what have thee gifted us the sense of hentai.  * Download R18 version * Board up your room * Destroy the lights * Grab the blankets * Watch it in dire gaze * Repeat above with girlfriend.
This game is as colorful as my language while I'm playing it.
i've loved Sayori and Chocola EVEN BEFORE this game!
I'm just gonna say this; I cannot wait for Volume 2 to come out! NEKO GIRLS FOR LIFE!
would play a game 10/10.  was very cute :D
Love it
I'm playing it for the plot
Dat Volume 2 dough?
Didn't know this was a edited version (I thought this was the full game) until I google image searched......
This was a pretty cool VN, but it's just that a VISUAL NOVEL! This "Game" has no choices or hidden endings or anything like that,  That being said from the novel perspective I would say that it was pretty good! It's a cheesy story about a dude who owns a bakery and has catgirls with him.  The visuals are pretty and boobs bounce upon pressing the "P" key. There is a graphical option for how much boobs bounce,  Speaking of boobs, the steam version has a bit of content cut from the game, someone has made a patch to add that content back in, here is my guide:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=423361968  Overall this VN was pretty good but just remember when buying that you are buying it for Kawaii catgirls and animated hentai, and that this is in fact, not a game.
Wurf
Very nice game. More detailed than other gal games (Chest Bounciness). Uncut version = happy fappening! Have fun my Weeaboos and now fuck off you cheeky cunts!
One of the best VN game I have played so far not because of the story but because of the innovation. This is the first I have seen a fully animated VN and the animation is really fluid. Also the Moe art style of this VN is over the top cute! Freaking love this VN and I recommend to all VN players out there.
Bought this as part of a visual novel mega pack.  Its quite a short visual novel, story isnt that good really. Though judging from vol 1 there will be more to follow.  The only thing i can really tell you is it is exactly like any other typical short story visual novel although the game tries to be different by animating the 2d sprites. Thats pretty much it.  Mediocre at best. I can't really complain since i worked out it cost me at around £0.79. If you want to play it i'd wait for it to go on a big sale. I dont think the game is worth the money they're asking for at full price
Shigure is the supreme waifu, no doubt
It's a game about catgirls who act as much like cats as they do girls, but you already purchased it as soon as you saw catgirls didn't you?   Gameplay:  It's a VN with no gameplay whatsoever not even choices so don't go in expecting to woo your waifu because they will end up banging you no matter what happens.  Story:  You open a box and suddenly you have two catgirls. Why do you have them? Will you keep them? Is flat truly justice? All this and more will be answered.  Graphics:  All of the characters are animated (face layers, body layers, hair layers, etc. all moving independently) which is slightly offputting and makes it seem like a flash game almost. The layered system does allow for some silly animations (not buttsecs) and a chest bounciness slider because of course there is a chest bounciness slider why the hell wouldn't there be? Aside from that the whole game is the standard Japanese artstyle affair. The one where all the women have permenent blushes and no one looks above the age of 16. You know the one. Oh yeah you know the one. You sick fuck.  Overall:  If you like catgirls (of course you do) the first half of this is really entertaining, but if you like fucking catgirls the second half of this will be right up your alley. Just don't take anyone else with you in that alley you pervert.   6.5/10 would watch catgirls fail at not being cats again.
- Very detailed and beautiful backgrounds and characters - Excellent story and humor - Great soundtrack - Highly recommended for aspiring genetic engineers
My parents saw me play this game. I'm now on over 17 adoption sites in North Korea.
Best game ever :v
it's alright
Do not play the 18+ version of this game, while you're parents are at home.  They came into my room while the nudity where happening. Now I'm grounded and the game has been deleted.  Jk, I'm a 40 years old man living in my mums basement. She can't tell me what to do! :D
.
In the words my friend once said "Its a game where a man just wants to move away and bake cakies without being called a faggot by his father". This is my first visual novel and i must say its been a unique experience.
Things I liked - Boob bounciness setting - Catgirls - Plot - Good character developement. Really good - Good dialogue. Really good  Things I didn't  - Too short - Not enough Nekos - No guns or FPS - Like no choices, man. Just sit back and enjoy the ride *wink wink*  Fin: 10/10 ,would play again. Most likely will, over and over Side note: R18 get it or you will be dissapointed in yourself and your life choices
Definitely unlike any visual novel I've ever read. With stunning colours, beautiful CG and gorgeous catgirls, it's a game I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and boob physics. :) High hopes for the future of this incredible story.
18 patch+ nekogirls = Mini me is happy! :D
I cried tears of joy
Best 10 bucks I've ever spent. 10/10  100% chest bounciness.
Completed the game in less than an hour. Replayed the game multiple times. Loved it each time. Nuff said.
Catgirls Boobs Hentai Kawaii   10/10 'Nuff said
I love Coconut...
10/10 Flawless game can not wait for Vol 2
Okay so... This game is awesome  -Pros  -Unlockable 18+ mode which is easy to unlock -Story is amazing i cried like 4 times -Chest bounciness meter I prefer 75% but 100% is good too -H scenes alot of them like a crap load i won't upload them but there are a crapload of H scenes -Chocola is just to cute  11/10
good storyline, waiting for vol.2
Loved the game
i fucked a cat 10/10
FEELS... IN [i][b]MY[/b][/i] NEKO-FILLED VISUAL NOVEL?!
Good fantasy it was worth buying.
In my opinion, this game is often touching throughout the story. I've enjoyed playing it and had a good laugh at some points.
What? Don't look at me like that... I play this game for the story and nothi- Oh hey, Coconut -spams the p key like a motherfucker-  10/10 Would press "p" to make boobs bounce again
I bought this game because of the high rating and I'm starting to get in to visual novels, I was not expecting that many sex scenes but I won't complain. I bought it for the story (dead serious, not a joke), I read in a forum that there was only one sex scene so I thought it would be mostly story...nope, had to play at night with headphones on.  If cat girls is your thing then I recommend but if you are looking for a compelling story look elsewhere.
In case you're unaware, Valve are forcing all eroge developers to release censored versions on steam. As kotaku points out, there are plenty of games that don't get censored for sexual content, including The Witcher franchise and of course, GTA.  This 'game', in the very strictest sense, is a Visual Novel, the story is completely linear and there are no choices for different paths, having said that, I'm not sure I'd want to spend the time do multiple paths either. The story so far has been pretty boring and uneventful, the visuals are 'nice' especially when streamed to the Gear VR HMD - Chocola' name badge is massive.   It seems that most of the effort has gone into animating the Neko's breasts and stripping content, and while this may be a draw for some, it doesn't quite have the depth you expect from a highly rated eroge.  I'd love to recommend this, but I'm only going to continue 'playing' in case the prequel/sequel improve upon the above points.  Unlikely I would wear a blue penguin T-shirt again.
NEKO EVERYWHERE ~~~ *Nosebleed  R+18 ? Challenge accepted !!!!  ~2 Hours Later~ Is it a game ??? Oh my im just 18 and im noob at this *.*
You need this "game" if you like cat girls. Keep in mind steam sells the cut version. Just google Nekopara vol. 1 18+ patch and follow intructions from there.  -Nice, relaxing story for when you don't wanna actually play anything -Music is on point and sets the mood well -H scenes are yes -Nekopara profile backgrounds -Nekopara cards sell for more than most other cards I got from other games for some reason  I never thought I would actually love this game as much as I do. Vol 2 when???
I had a few people message me about being a pervert when I opened the game. -- LesbianCatgirls/10
The best VN game in Steam! Cute loli catgirls as your lover? I'd kill someone for that. Not to mention the R-18 patch made the VN even better. Get it and enjoy it!
Assuming that you instal the restored content patch this game is for you if;  - You like the idea of having sex with mentally retarded/deficient people  - Love stereotypic annoying anime "dirty talk" in an obnoxious voice (well, the voices in themselves aren't really obnoxious more the way it's said)  - Is not bothered by the moral implications of genetically engineering mentally deficient people to keep as pets.   - (and then having sex with them)  - (and having them work for you for no pay. Yay slavery.)  - Like the idea of having sex with people of a questionable age  - Like the idea of having a romantic relationship with someone that (it seems, from one comment the main character makes) is going to die of old age in like ten years   - Like polygamy  - Like the idea of your sister trying to/ wanting to sleep with you  If you don't instal that patch why on earth would you want to play this game? Though the points above still apply only the sex is only implied. Which honestly is kind of an improvement. Though some of the animations are pretty nice if you turn off the sound.  On the plus side the animations/expressions are pretty cool and the sister subplot, while a little disturbing, is kind of funny.  2/10 Difficult to fap to  Also not a very enjoyable story and kind of distrubing in a lot of ways.   If I was going to summarise the game in one word it would be cringy.  p.s. They are called cat girls which begs the question "Are there also cat boys (none are shown in the game) and if not, since they can't have children with humans, how do they produce offspring? Do they have sex with normal male cats? Are they all produced in test tubes?"  p.s.s. I did finish the game, though it doesn't show that much time "officially" it's because I played it offline.
For a visual novel, I am greatly enjoying the story line and how freaking adorable the main characters are. I would recommend this for those who like or enjoy cutesy sub story telling, or those who enjoy adorable little catgirls who like to cause trouble for their master.  (＝ω＝.) seriously so freaking adorable   On a side note,  GGGRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.... FEEEEEEEEEEEELINGGGGSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! (the opening of the storyline is killer for thoses who have a soft heart or caring people)
"They were like my children but also lovers:" This sentence from the self-insert MC pretty much sums up what's wrong with this game. I expected lustig after and then shagging girls with cat ears and tails. Instead I get surrogate special needs to raise, who eventually get bedded under the pretense of healthcare. And a prepubescent sister who wants in on it. Also, there are no decision points whatsoever, it's all Point A to B with a lot of clicking in between.  The art is relatively detailed. Characters look cute, albeit generic. The writing is basic Doujin level - bad, with a few good lines here and there. One great feature is, that you can adjust the volume of individual characters. I found Chocola's squeaking almost unbearable, but some of the other characters had pleasant voiceovers. The actual porn is also doujin-level, except for a few animated shots which are fairly smooth.  The gametime is nowhere near the 9 hours I have here. I mostly "played" the game while waiting for queues and respawns in Doto.  Fazit: Watch free porn on the internet and spend your money elsewhere.This is neither good porn, nor a good VN.
69/10 The plot got to me I swear...
69/10 would fap again.
Any one got a spair P key?
10/10 would nyan again If you buy NekoPara, make sure to patch the r18 version so you can play the game as God intended. This game is worth twice as much as you pay, and just when you think it's over, it gets better.  IT GETS BETTER.
this catgirls are sooo cute :3
Motto motto kawaii desu yo nyah! OMG Nekomimi oppai! Desu desu desu etc etc! Every part of my body recommends this VN! Do it!
Kawaii nekos... ALL THE KAWAII NEKOS!!!!!!!!!!!     Ok review time now.  So, *YES i did purchase this myself, don't judge until you see my profile info* where do i start on this game. For one it has a long playability but no paths like other games i.e If My Heart Had Wings, Everlasting Summer, etc. So one run through is all you're going to get, it may not seem worth it but look at my hours.. That's with me speedreading, i didn't taking my time reading and going in depth. This is a very emotional anime/Vn i've seen since Everlasting Summer and a few others. [spoiler]For one *spoiler* the protagonist gets sick and nearly loses both the girls because they try to help him... Their faces...... The emotion... The feels!! ;_; And yes i did shead a tear at that part, call me a big baby, go ahead i dare you. I will send you the hentai patch... oh wait you would probably like that *all evil jokes aside*[/spoiler] The hentai patch, like all other VN's, ruins the game for me. But the good thing about it is if you want to see very little hentai *like half of 2 chapters out of 11* then it's not that bad. Most of your playthrough will have you laughing though as well.. Cat girls... or in this case as "I" will call them... nekos! I'm not spoiling much but i will say something, if you don't want a possible harem anime... *sorry if i spelt that wrong* do NOT go after this game, for one the two nekos, at the end it turns into 5, plus your sister making advances at you in the story making it lean to incest, well not actual "advances" more like he leaves the room and she talks to herself saying how she would love to be with him.. All weirdness aside, if you can ge past all of the stuff i said. Pick up this game, it has a bunch of different kind of emotions, a lot of funny, a few sad, most normal or just plain stupid.. yes i'm looking at you with your training scene with vanilla, devs!!!  Anyway... sorry i'm all over the place with this review it is currently.... *looks at clock* 3:04AM.... FML i'm going to sleep!!  [b]Final Review[/b] 9.5/10 - (Side note) COME OUT WITH VOL 2 ALREADY!!!
If only steam would let us play the R18 Version.............
Run faster than Batman Arkham Knight 10/10
this game cures loneliness.
Cute and intresting story. I could do without the hetai stuff but meh. 10/10 would disappoint my sister agian.
I see this game as a trust exercise with your friends because as soon as you see anyone playing this, you just KNOW they are jacking off, and everybody knows you are too when they see you playing this game. It's a bonding experience.
Bought this game and downloaded the uncensored one. Charge overuled. 10/10
no
The main character seems to have two dick, can cum multiple times, gets mad pussy (In more ways than one), however this game is overly censorered unless you download full version, damn you steam!
Silly Steam and its censorship. You can try and stop me owning both versions and converting your Nekopara made for casuals but it won't work. You either turn this 18+ or you can come to the realisation that you're not cut out for the almost fatal dose of everything amazing this kinetic novel will give you, and I mean amazing. So much kawaisa, neko loli/10 for the mere beginning of the end.
NEKOPARA is a wonderful eroge. Beautiful character designs and voice acting. Wish I could say more but I don't know what else to say.
why are you still reading reviews?  buy the game already!
If you came to this page and are looking at the reviews then you know what you are getting yourself into, so I'm going to be blunt.  Catgirls and a "Chest Bounciness" slider setting. Need I say more?
+ Full support of gamepads. - With a gamepad, both hands are busy.
I totally bought this.
Nya~~ Nya~~~ Nya~~~~
Downloaded the 18+ patch. Sexed the nekos. Never looked back. 10/10
While playing this Nekopara, I cannot describe what kind of feelings i have.  [h1]These [b]NEKO[/b] are so [b]CUTE!!![/b][/h1]
This game is ... Meow !  if you have some free time to read some kind of romantic and naughty story with cat girl , i'm sure you gonna like this game ..  10 / 10 would buy if i have 2nd account :P
It's not really a game but more of a story where you just click and watch it play. But it is still pretty goddamn kawaii-desu. :3
I was in it for the plot guys
Good game, cute nekogirls, what more do you want?
In this game, you run a bakery together with some cats, whom you also f*ck.  You might think that's weird, but don't worry, it's not.  You'll know this because you keep running into strangers who are like, "Hey, are those your cats?  Are you f*cking them?"  And then you'll blush because you're an easily embarrassed sort of protagonist, [spoiler]and it was the cats' idea anyway![/spoiler]  But then all these strangers are like, "No, it's cool, everybody f*cks their cats nowadays."  So you know it's cool and totally not weird to f*ck your cats.  Also, strangers in Japan seem really nosy about that sort of thing.
ive seen some shit
short, but entertaining very easy to get all achievements.
Nekopara is a high quality kinetic novel (meaning no interactions, only reading) featuring catgirls and adult themes, although the Steam version is censored unless you apply some shenanigans to it (refer to this Community Hub link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370848130). The voice acting is in Japanese with subs for Japanese, English, and Chinese.  The art is extremely well done and fairly crisp. I played in a 1600x900 resolution which appears to be as high as it goes. Fullscreen will give it black borders as the game will maintain its aspect ratio to prevent stretched catgirls (very important). The level of quality that Nekopara has in terms of its art assets remains consistent throughout the entire experience with good coloring, shadowing, and light animations to help give the characters life such as head turning, blinking, breathing, and breast jiggling depend on how you use that slider.  I have no complaints with the music. It has tunes ranging from upbeat to laidback and brought me closer to my inner anime. The game comes with a music player that can Play, Stop Repeat, and Repeat All should you decide to just chill out. The opening song is pretty good.  Finally, the story seemed appropriate for what it was trying to do. It had its fair share of funny and “What is going on?” moments. The story follows Kashou and how he handles the two catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, coming into his life when he’s trying establish himself in the world as a baker. I don’t recommend thinking too hard about the rules that the world has regarding catgirls as those kind of discussions could lead to very strange places.  Voice acting seemed fine with tones that matched the dialogue. I really liked how they would say some of the verbs out loud. Rub, rub, for example. Or stare. That’s not something I’ve seen very often and adds a silly vibe to it.  Anyhoo, don’t purchase Nekopara for gameplay since there isn’t any. Your decision should be based on your interest in its story, the voice acting, the music, and the art.
no freinds = no one can judge.  :)
8/8 i r8 gr8
Just started playing it and I like it.  It has cat girls and all bath scene.  I got the R18+ running and haven't finished it all. Just need to make sure that no one sees me playing this game.   Since I'm still playing it, I will still give it a 11/10 catgirls.  The plot is going on nicely.
I bought "the version" cough* from elsewhere but I got it on steam because it was that good.   Just like most visual novel, it's somewhat interactive (you know what I mean) but nothing like chioces or routes to take. It doesn't matter though, there are plenty of VNs out there like this.    Story isn't much, it feels like a teaser with fanservice to me, but I think it's enjoyable, whether some may think it's some sort of BS or not.  Only downside for me is that this is short, which is understandable by the title Vol.1; it's long enough to enjoy it.  I like to shake the game window (since I play in windowed mode) as if I want to minimize everything except for this game. Otherwise, you can just press P for similar effect, but you can't really control directions with that. Shaking the window is best.    ....don't forget to maximize the bounciness meter *cough*.   looking forward to further interactions, maybe with other cat girls;;;
If you don't have this game you clearly aren't living.
The art is quite good, and the story is cute and entertaining, at least for around 3 hours. Then the story dies out as some sexual content emerges. There's also no replay value.  The uncensored version has a lot of hentai scenes, which have been edited out here.   I would reccomend this game if you like comics/hentai stuff. But I would not if you like interactive games (point/click adventures) or games that are story-driven/story-rich. A graphic novel should be story-rich, but this fall short of that.
I like girls. I like cats. I like Japan. It was on sale, i thought "why not".  Turns out i now like Japanese cat-girls.  A life-changing game.
Make your dreams come true.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Oth49BiQc
Don't buy this game unless you want to lose the things you need, like your social life. 10/10 Would pay for again.
Mom disowned me, Brother can't look at me in the face anymore, and I lost all my friends  11/10 best game ever
I wish to fuck the catgirls
[b] [u] [i] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH [/i] [/u] [/b]  [spoiler] where is vol. 2 [/spoiler]
So far it's superadorable... also Catgirls. So yes, I effing recomend this game.
One of the best Anime games i have ever played 10/10.
so I started this game and I thought the girls were cute, right? and then it got weird and by weird I mean incestual  10/10 god bless would play again where is vol. 2
You fuck cats.
I hate myself a little bit for this....
It is a great Visual Novel. I wont write a six-paged story why it is great its just a recommandation from me also it has great voice acting, runs on a potatoe, and i love the cat girls :3
Just bought this...Installed +18 version already.. And now, the trip begins ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's cute, but that's about it. The characters are pretty flat and the MC irks me, but the attitude toward sex isn't as roundabout as you would expect. Production values are good. Visuals are clean, more (and better) animation than most VN's, voice acting is good, really comfortable interface and lots of options. Music was kind of forgettable though.   For two hours with cat girls, I didn't mind it, but there's not really much else there. Take a short break from your back catalog, read it once, return to your regularly scheduled programming.
I love the art style. The detail in every drawing is simply amazing, though there were one or 2 times where i think there could have been one or two more drawings (like when they´re running but they still have their normal poses). The story, while a bit underwhelming at first turns into something great after, i genuenly cared about the characters and i still got a couple laughs. My problem is... WHY IS THIS CONSIDERED A GAME? i get it, its a visual novel, i love them, but at least give us an option in the dialogue or something, aside from clicking "Game Start" and "Autoplay", there is no interactivity here.  Still, Nekopara Vol.1 is great and will remain in my mind as one extremely good visual novel. I can´t wait for volume 2!!  Final Score: 8.5/10  Meow meow~
Meow~~~~ 10/10
it was awsome seriously but i which i  could make some choices but story and characters for me was awsome ill be waiting for Vol. 2
It's kind of like Hatred with a bit happier setting.
What can I say about this. Its not really a game, its a visual novel. And its origionally meant for adults, as in 18+ If you are gonna get this then get the 18+ version. Why? because without it you are pretty much getting an incomplete story.  18+ content aside though its quite amusing and the main characters Chocola and Vanilla are all kinds of adorable. The voice acting is superb and I absolutely love the music. The story itself isn't overly long or complicated. And it has its moments of sillyness, humor and that touch of awkwardness that you can only find in anime and manga.  Do I reccomend this? Yes. Its not for everyone. But if you like cute anime ( cat ) girls. And you are not opposed to Erotic works then give this story a chance. Above all else its an amusing love story.
Thousand years of evolution led up to me playing Nekopara I am not disappointed
Boobs 10/10
Streamed this, friends watched it, friends don't talk to me anymore. 10/10 -IGN
You know its a good game when you can buy an 18+ Verson
Start game.  Hold Ctrl.  Get 100% achievements.  Sell cards for an extra $1-2.
R.I.P P button you will be missed
As a fellow gentleman, I am here to offer advice when playing the lovely game. You should first go to the options and set the boob bouncing to max and then while in game shake your windowed screen like crazy not only do you get an achievement but you also get the reward of .... well you know. 12/10 neko girls be the best~!~!~!~
No comment.
8/10 for steam ver. 100/10 for 18+ ver.
While on sale this costed 6,69 € It had the number 69 in it Bought because i was thinking it had a 69 scene in it The game doesn't actually have a 69 scene in it -1/10 for misleading price
Warning: This is a visual novel, not a game. There are no choices or interactions here, you just press "next" and watch what happens.  Story is incredibly cringy and the sex scenes are too laughable to feel aroused. Characters are incredibly cute and the voice-acting is decent. Sound effects can be really creepy.  Oh, and it takes 5 whole big chapters for the first sex scene.
Chest Bounciness. Nekos 18+.  I R8 8/8.
It is a game that makes you fall in love with the Cat Girls. They are cute and lovely, and they are devoted to their master. If you love cute cat girls, you should totally get this game.
I will never play this VN in front of a lot of people again  1000/10 for restoration patch
This is a linear visual novel. No choices.  The game is very fun to play, drawn well and quite well written ( I played the steam version, no patch) The voice acting is pretty well done. There are little animations to the characters  which gives a nice more alive feeling to the game.  My favourite parts are where the voice actresses call out the purring/ staring, etc. That's just too adorable.  Downside is that the story is quite short. Unless I guess, you play the 18+ version and keep watching the you-know-what-scenes. Personally for the steam version I played, I wouldn't pay more then 5 bucks (which I did, because steam sales).  I also could have done without the sexual innuendo of [spoiler]his little sister[/spoiler], that went a bit to the creepy side.
BEST Visual Novel EVER! 11/10  If u want to get the 18+ version patch, it's here : https://mega.co.nz/#!edoEiBLQ!XUM7S1v2hN3fsBtLvXpXac8Ey6SfkZpxYu2ZQknZH0o  How to install patch : 1.

i am the happiest man alive
A great game.I loved it quite frankly.And that hidden jiggle feature. .3.
Came to Summer Sales for GTA V. Bought this visual novel instead.  10/10 will press P button over and over again.
This recommendation comes with HUGE caveats, especially if the game is not on sale at the moment which you decide to buy it. I honestly don't believe the users should be tagging this with "visual novel", as that implies some sort of player interactivity. This should be referred to as a "kinetic novel", which basically means "just point and click through the dialogue and enjoy the story".  Pros: -The art is bright and cheerful ( I love the cell style coloring). -The animations are more than just a simple fade between two static frames. They are smooth and very much like watching an anime. -Instant fan service/gratification -Super cute, tug-on-your-heartstrings cat girls -The addition of super cute voice acting -Bouncy you-know-what slider  Cons: -The story is nothing to get excited about. Even with how short it is, there was ample opportunity to not go the typical route, but sadly at no point is it unpredictable. -Characters are also very typical. You have the holy trinity of fan service: Super cute, overly excited girl, super shy, reserved girl,  and doting protagonist who just happens to have this all fall into his lap. -The emote system while smoother and providing nice animations as mentioned above, are not really "countless" as suggested in the games description. There are four main poses that get used throughout the majority of the game. -No replay value. Except for that...maybe...  All in all, I'd suggest it as a guilty pleasure. There isn't a lot of depth, but it is fun. Enjoy the fan service!
i got this game because i shared accounts with a friend    he told me to get the H patch i did   I am allergic to cats  this game became a horror game real fast the main character was assaulted by the cats girls and then the girls raped him and was forced to live with this   10/10 would cry in a ball again and have allergic PTSD
Short, but graphics are really nice. Not for those that expect a pathway type of game.
Neko girl why are we not funding this ?
As soon as I ran the game my ex-friends instantly judged me nya/10
it has pretty good game mechanics. if you catch my bounce.
not easily offended
Huge plot ✓ Perfect plot physics ✓ Steam offline ✓  10/10
*launches steam in offline mode*
[h1]By the emperor, A game about semi- furry heresy![/h1] No but seriously, I have no idea if this is any good. All I know is that the writing is pretty funny. If you're hardcore patch it with the R18 content because the Steam release doesn't have it. It's not hard, just "acquire" (purchase or "torrent") the files somehow and replace the files in the Steam directory with the R18 release's files. After that, right click the game on steam and set the launch properties to [b] -steam="yes" [/b] and you're done.  Had to explain to my Father what "neko" is and why I own this after he walked in on me reading it. 10/10 would bond again.  If you're on this page and saw what this is and still want it you'll probably like it. I don't even like Visual Novels but I thought this was entertaining.
omg. Why. This isnt a game. Dont test me. no great to this
Cute, just cute, what else could I say, I highly recommend this to a few of you, but just don't get, eh. . .
TIFU by playing nekopara when nobody was home. Turns out when people do come back, no explanations work.  11/10 for harsh reality.
it's okay
I did not have any expectations to this but I thought that I can at least decide who to f*** first.  Buy this if you love catgirls and you don't care if your opinion does not mater. If you actualy decide to buy it download the 18+ version.  10/10 Because of anti-physics chest-bouncyness.
I'm not going to lie, I haven't quite finished the game, but I just had to come and gush. While of course as a kinetic novel it doesn't have much in the way of choices, it makes up for it in story and character art. I've played Sakura Spirit and Sakura Angels and loved them, but this has those two beat. Aside from the adorable cat girls, the extra animation adds to their characterization and story. For sure this is aimed at the niche market of cute anime girls and visual novels, but it's purrfect for me. (eheheh.... pun)  This is absolutely adorable and I can't get enough of these girls. Now I just want the game with Cinnamon (scottish fold) and Coconut (maine coon) to come out. I'd like to learn their stories. <3
I got interested in this game after watching therpgminx (or just Minx) playing this on youtube. It kinda acted like a visual novel in my opinion... a pretty damn good one too. I laughed in some areas, and I nearly cried near the end. I've been looking for the 18+ version, but regardless, the story line was great, 10/10, and cuteness level was over 9000. I would love to play Vol.2.
Developed by the amateur doujin company Neko Work’s, Nekopara is exactly what you might expect of such a visual novel with that nomenclature. Cute nekomimi characters, fluffy endearing moments, and the occasional nuggets of merriment wrapped up in the slice of life format. It isn’t much for those wanting more than moe and definitely isn’t a surefire recommendation, but as far as being a pleasant encounter with affable designed archetypes, a unique gimmick, and introduction to a series  it is more or less of an enticing pull into a companies premier work than anything else. As someone who is usually drawn in the by genre in any format, I thought I enjoyed this title, yet knowing how it can be double edged sword, I can say that I mildly enjoyed Nekopara on a surface level, yet by the same token, a very easily forgettable experience with little to offer. With that Being Said I Would Indeed reccomend this title being a care free neko I can relate to this and i indeed found myself emotionally attached to coconut having great art style and develpment she fills the gap that other our now currently filling. ie Rias Gremmory, Hatsune Miku, Asauna, And even the chick From Nisekoi. This Game doesnt try to be somthing its not and i would easily give it 7.5 out of 10.
A really nice looking game,i love the catgirls ! They are so cute ^^. A must buy for all anime lovers.   [h1]Score:[/h1] 10/10
Patch Then Play  This game makes me very moist and tingly yet warms up my insides of the adorable little cat girls. Sometimes when reading this I get happy. I don't remember liking cat girls this much until now. Forwarning though if you have any cats in your house do not get any ideas.. I recommend this if your into cute little kitty girls that are hella adorable! Great storyline would definetaly read again. Waiting on Vol 2. :3
Great stress reliever! Cute Neko Girls and interesting story. Why not right?
10/10 would catgirl again.
Because of this game my friends started calling me 2D-Kun. 10/10
first of all, very veeeery good art style, good storyline, good graphics and all that. :3  but i really really hope to see more options based on interacting with the persons. <3
I shook the game window and everything was jiggle game of the year
100/10 fin all time when i play this game my right hand is busy :v i just kidding lol
nice
Its a very sweet and predictable story but none the less it has its cute laughs. Id recommend this game for if youre bored and you like catgirls. I absolutely love the diversity of the catgirls and how sweet his little sister is. There isnt any story choices as its just a visual novel, but the ending is still sweet. At least theres more!
It's 2015 and I have just seen what technology can do for us in the future.  Will never look at cats with the same eyes as before.   "Plot" +1 Moe Catgrils +1 Chest bounciness slider +100    I was there for the plot. I swear.  11/10
http://puu.sh/ipGFN/272d1923b8.jpg 10/10 Would get fooled again
A simple, fun kinetic novel. You don't really play it but instead watch and enjoy at your own pace. So sweet that it will give you diabeetus. Barebones story but colourful art and refreshing non-static graphics.  I personally spoke aloud the protagonist's spoken dialogue which made it a lot more immersive as the character's really felt like they were responding. You have to make your own fun for content like this. Was also fun to stream it in this way.  If you like 3 lumps of sugar in your tea and cute anime catgirls then by all means give this a go.
The gaming industry is saved.
9/11 has boobles
11/10 would jiggle again
It's...erm...a good game...
A great source of Fap and Waifu material   Pros: +Good Art +Good Vocals +Somewhat Etertaining Plot +The "bounce" Feature  Cons: -Somewhat short compared to other eroges and VNs -Replayability -The Removal of the H-Scenes   8.5/10
"I don't remember having a white desk"   10/10 would play again
I don't know what I just played there.... but it was great :D!
Fully voice acted and animated, which is a thing you don't often find in visual novels.
I... I'm out of words... It's... It's too damn cute.  [spoiler] I am disappointed in my life, and I don't even know what I am doing with it. [/spoiler]
There are two things that rule the internet: Cats and Boobs. I think you get my point.  11/10 would Nyan~ again
Mr.Protagonist is stupid, but Chocola and Vanilla are cute. I wonder what the R-18 version is like. Considering you do you know what with them... ...AND THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CATS  Reccomended to weirdo weebs, as furries will be dissapointed because Nekos aren't counted as furry.
i like cute cats
must get for eroge fans
Very good visual novel, the artwork is nice and the characters really pop out. Ending was nice but the game overall could've been longer.
So just finished the game. Pretty good. Loved the comedy and the charachters and I was even NEAR tears at certain parts. Nekoara Vol. 1 may not be the greatest VN, but was definitly enjoyable in all aspects. Cute art, great VAing and pretty lovable charachters. I more than likely will buy Vol. 2 if and when it comes out.  However if you are reading this and plan to buy it MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND that this is a kinetic VN. MEANING there are no choices involved. I bought the game before knowing that. I honestly love VNs with routes and such.   SO DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CHOICES AND ROUTES OR ALT ENDINGS.  BUY THIS IF, IF YOU WANT 10000000% CUTE NEKO GIRLS, GOOD VAING AND CHEST BOUNSINESS.  Enjoy the game yo =)
first off gonna say great game and i see no downsides to this. second can anyone tell me when vol. 2 is coming out as i am now have nekopara withdrawls, which are somehow worse than mountain dew withdrawls.
Now we just need volume 2 here.
[b][u]Overview[/u]:[/b]  NekoPara Vol. 1 is a relatively short Japanese kinetic visual novel from NEKO WORKS that dazzles in the visuals but falls short in a lot of other areas.  It is the first entry in what I'm sure will be a successful series and functions as a prologue to a world where catgirls are a part of every day society.  [b][u]Reviewer's Notes[/u]:[/b]  Cocerning the eroge aspect and the 18+ version versus the All Ages version, the Steam version of this game is the All Ages version.  That means all the adult content that is in the normal game is cut out or in a few rare cases left in but censored (such as the bath sequence).  As far as I know there will be no official patch or release of the 18+ version of this game on Steam.  There are ways to get around this and those that are interested in circumventing this particular decision should be able to do so easily.  For this review I will be looking at the game as a complete product, meaning the 18+ version.  The All Ages version does not add anything to the game, only remove.  For some people this will be for the good of the experience, for others not so much.  It really depends on how well you do with eroge visual novels and this one is pretty tame all things considered.  [b][u]Story[/u]:[/b]  Without going into too much detail the general arc of NekoPara Vol. 1 is our protagonist, Minazuki Kashou,  moves out to open up his own patisserie, "La Soleil."  He comes from a long line of Japanese confection makers but dreams of doing Western treats.  This causes some friction between him and his family and thus he heads off on his own.  While moving into his new place he discovers two catgirls hiding in boxes among his stuff.  These are our two female lead characters, Chocola and Vanilla.  His family has a whole bunch of other catgirls that his sister primarily takes care of that occasionally make an appearance along with his sister as the story plays out.  The main focus, however, is on our protagonist along with Chocola and Vanilla and follows them through the opening of his new business and their lives after.  It is a sweet, silly, and occasionally laugh out loud funny tale that is pretty predictable.  It is a by the books moe romp, setting up for a full on harem power trip in later volumes, with dashes of eroge fetish fan service throughout.  None of the characters are written exceptionally well.  In the case of the 18+ version you will get to slam in about three sex sequences that come in relatively rapid succession that very slightly will affect your feelings for the characters, but only in a blatant ham-fisted way.  [b][u]Visuals[/u]:[/b]  The first thing you will notice when you play this game is the visuals are stunning.  Visual novels are a dime a dozen, ones with high production value however are much more rare.  NekoPara Vol. 1 goes above and beyond in this regard, which should be expected from Sayori and NEKO WORKS.  The sprites are exceptionally well done and thanks to the dubbed "E-mote System," they are almost fully animated, meaning expressions are ever changing, eyes blinking, hair moving, the works.  This is by far the most impressive thing about NekoPara Vol. 1 and NEKO WORKS should be proud.  [b][u]Sound Design[/u]:[/b]  The voice acting is done very well, assuming you don't mind it being all in Japanese, with dedicated deliveries and a lot of character.  The music ranges from acceptable to down right bland.  [b][u]System[/u]:[/b]  The interface is clean and easy to use.  The font choice is good, very easy to read, and I had zero issue with navigating around and interacting with the game.  The options menu is relatively robust, especially in the audio department, and upon completion you should have a nice full Extras section completely with the CG Gallery, Scenes Gallery, Music, and Movies.  [b][u]Conclusion[/u]:[/b]  NekoPara Vol. 1 isn't a bad visual novel, it does the job it sets out to do.  If you like visual novels and want to support the medium then it is probably worth playing.  If you are a fan of beautiful art then it is probably worth playing.  If you like shallow and predictable but still strangely sweet stories then it is probably worth playing.  And of course  if you have ever wanted to bang catgirls then it is probably worth playing.
Cute visual novel. R18 version is like whoa. (only looked it up, only own censored version.)
Best Bakery owner + cat owner + Onii-sama simulator.
My rating is a bit mixed. I love the art style and story, the girls are adorable and cute. There isnt much to do...Nothing really requires an action. Some visual novels are that way and I can understand if that is their choice to go this route, but its a bit boring. It be good if you could pick destinations, actions, or pick things/items, just anything really. Otherwise you spend the whole game clicking and thats all. The art style is amazing and beautiful, the tones and texture are clear and smooth for the most part, the only problem is when there is movement it gets alittle fuzzy. I love anime and some visual novel games but it be good if you had choices or something. 6/10 Rating from me
If you are going to be a massive weeb, at least be one with taste and buy this.
What the fuck is a "rare cheesecake?"
Menstrooal pain.
WOW these cat girls are so ****  kawaii.....(ﾟДﾟ  )
Nekomimi cat girls, meido, and ultimate jiggle physics able to make even A-cups have an anti-gravitational bounce. - yeah, this game has dat animu fetish trifecta going on right there.  I really do love the art style. The characters are adorable. I also like how you can switch languages at ease, and the text font is easy to read. The story is a bit schmaltzy with the kawaii overload, but that's to be expected for an eroge visual novel like this. Overall, I think this is a great VN.  I decided to patch in the R18. Why? Even I don't know. But it adds more content, I guess. (Maybe.)  And to my older brother, I deeply apologize for using the money you gave me to buy this. But I still regret nothing.
This game is wonderful! I love Nekopara with a passion! No other game can make a real gammer like me who spends his time in Anime all day any more happy! There are many positive points to the game itself and one is the amazing Catgirls!  1. The graphics are amazing! 2. You have a good scense of jigle physics! 3. The dialouge is very impressive! 4. The storyline is amazing! 5. And most importantly..... WE HAVE CATGIRLS!!!  Thats the reason why I love this game! Hope this review showed how awesome I feel for the game! Thanks for the kawaii catgirls! :3
I now know what sex is.  11/10
I ran out of tissue
my friend gifted this game to me as a joke but the game is not a joke so i unfriended him
I totaly recomend this game.  super cute!  great graphics!   love it!!!
Waaa!!! Best VN I've ever read in my whole life!  Good Artworks Touching Storyline kawaii Neko-chan Moar kawaii Neko-chan~~ OPPAI!! (for R18+ patch only tho, havent tested it)  15/10 would wait for the VOL 2!!  hhyuu, kawaii neko chan desu~~ sugoi!! hyaaa, Pandamania170 no ecchi...  recommends this one. /(>_<)/  Ohyea hope they include a discount price for NekoPara VOL2 to those who owns NekoPara VOL 1...
It is a good galgame to play, girls are cute here
nukige like nakige? the story is heartwarming and pretty good. in my visual novel playlist there are only 1 game which has some genre with this.  Pros: + Heartwarming story + Animated sprite?  Cons: - the story pace is too short for me - lag on op and ed movies (blame my pc for that  trully recommended
The Point of this game is simple :  "There is no decision making/route so he [spoiler]fucked[/spoiler] both cats"
i LOVE this, nothing but the biggest smiles and heartache i have ever had, it's all too well done, i only wish it could be in english
You could pay thousands of dollars a year on hookers, strippers, etc.   OR you could pay less than $10 to:  -Own a bakery -Be the master of 2 adorable catgirls  -Have a caring little sister who owns 4 other catgirls -Be swimming in pussy -And most importantly, save money :D
I got this game in a Bundle i swear i really can explain...
hONESTLY, THE BEST YOU CAN GET WITH NEKOS. HOPE IT WASNT NURFED...
Just wating for the chapter 2!!! Hoping to see new "original settings" ^^
Neko, and more neko, if you love cats and anime, this is the game for you
ニャー。
Even though this game was originally intended as a NSFW game. I think the all ages version makes it even better. It is a fun and adorable game all about love. I give this a full 10/10, no joke.
Great game, going to laugh and shrug. Do you want to see Chocola and Vanilla? What are you waiting for, join the heartful comedy: P
Good game with a touching story and art is well done although most people will think you are a a hentai for playing this
Great!
Proud to play this game!!!!!
I SWEAR IT WAS A GIFT!
A beautiful work of art God bless the creator
10/10 100/100 best story time ever.    would play it again but...    BEST GAME would recommend
It has no dogs in it. 0/10
Who wouldn't want to run a patisserie with catgirls running about?  Also, they let you change breast physics~ :3  Real Review: Art looks reallllly good if you kno what I mean~ VO's may be too high for some people but it does not bother me. (Plus you can change how loud each VO's voice is) They have added little visual effect's to each Character so they seem that bit more realistic when there moving or emoting around and about. One of the best looking visual novels around, story is about what you expect if you played these types of VN's before. But the story does get you invested with the Character's so you "feel" a bit for them if something goes awry.. Lastly, it is just vol.1 so its not long at all. I was done with it in about 6 hours or so.  (P.S: Type in on google "Nekopara R18+ patch and see if you want to go... ahem all the way with this VN) (P.S P.S: I may or may not have done the patch~)  Just buy it.
im good at this game
Why did I buy this?
Feelings are hard in this one. { ͡• ͜ʖ ͡•}  And the plot and musics are really bouncy fun. { ͡• ͜ʖ ͡•}
[h1]Introduction[/h1]  I'll be honest, initially I thought that my main source of enjoyment from the first entry of the Nekopara visual novels would be the sexual encounters (yes I installed the 18+ patch). As I read through, I slowly began to appreciate the personalities of the characters and the world around them. If you are looking for something to fap to, look no further, as Nekopara delivers on that front quite well. However, there is more to this visual novel adaption than eroticism.  Nekopara is developed by Neko Works, a company consisting of the original artist of the manga works, Sayori, and various programmers and scenario writers. It was localized by the famous Sekai Project, who also brought The Fruit of Grisaia and is bringing Clannad to North America. Nekopara is built on the Kirikiri engine, featuring a plugin called the "E-mote" system, which brings the characters to life through smooth animations. The opening song (OP) is Taiyou Paradise, sung by nao. The ending song (ED) is Nekomanma Biyori, sung by Haruka Shimotsuki. Nekopara was released on Steam on December 29, 2014 for $10.   [h1]Premise and Story[/h1]  Nekopara is set in a world in which some humans have been genetically modified to have cat-like features (or is it the other way around?), such as cat ears, tails, and general cat behaviour. These humanoid cats are deemed "catgirls" and are a common component of Japanese families. They are treated like normal pets and important members of the family. They can understand and communicate with humans at a basic level, although the complexities of human emotions and societal structure remain incomprehensible. In order for a catgirl to be trusted on their own in the world, they must take a Bell exam so that they can earn a Bell. These Bells signify that the catgirl wearing them is fit to walk among humans, and that their owner(s) have educated them sufficently.  The story starts with the protagonist, Minaduki Kashou, moving out of his parents' house to start up his own bakery, Patisserie La Soleil. The grammatical error is explained, I assure you. As he is unpacking his things, two medium sized boxes catch his attention. Two catgirls, the energetic, enthusiastic Chocola and the soft-spoken, subtle Vanilla spring out of the boxes, greeting their master. Kashou's younger sister, Shigure, smuggled them aboard the moving truck so that they could assist Kashou in his business. Over the course of Volume 1, the catgirls develop romantic feelings for Kashou under the guise of physical maturation, then they finally admit their feelings. Despite the fluffy and light nature of the story, there are some emotionally charged moments that enraptured me. [spoiler] Chocola shares some intimate memories of her and Vanilla's childhood early in the novel, and the last chapter involves Kashou nearly dying from overwork and the catgirls rushing to find a doctor. [/spoiler]  [h1]Gameplay and Presentation[/h1]  Nekopara is a kinetic novel, which means there are no player choices. The story is told almost entirely from Kashou's perspective. The player's interactions consist of:  Left Click/Enter: Advance text Ctrl: Skip text P: Makes characters' breasts jiggle Alt-F4: Emergency panic button  The VN is divided into 8 chapters, and each chapter is 45 minutes to an hour long, depending on how fast you read and if you listen to the voice acting (which is superb). If you decide to install the 18+ patch, there are 3 sex scenes spread out between chapters 5 - 7. Without the sex scenes, a readthrough takes about 4-5 hours, and 6-7 hours with the patch. The E-mote system provides silky smooth character animations and movements. To be honest, it's the first time I've seen this much liveliness in a visual novel, so it was impressive to me.   The art style is clean and well presented, with vibrant colours and detailed facial features. The backgrounds are relatively simple, but beautifully rendered. Almost all of the artwork was done by Sayori, the original artist of the Neko Paradise works. Not much to say about the art except that it is alluring and utterly gorgeous to look at.  All of the characters with the exception of the protagonist are fully voiced. In addition to the onscreen characters, there are unseen tertiary characters such as shop owners and passersby that are voiced as well. All audio is in Japanese, although you may set the text and interface to English, Japanese, or Chinese.   Sekai Project's localization is both accurate and humourous. Take a look at my screenshots for proof of this. Listening to the voices and comparing it to the text, I found little to no errors in the translation, and honorifics were kept untouched, which is a personal plus. Keep in mind that I am not experienced in the Japanese language, but I do know basic structure and particles. Take my words with a grain of salt.   [h1]Final Remarks/Conclusion[/h1]  In short, whether you are a fan of anthropomorphized cats or not, Nekopara is a highly enjoyable visual novel. Although the main appeal of this series is the H-scenes, the patch is optional. The Steam version was censored because of Steam's policies and to appeal to a wider audience. A quick Google search will grant you access to the adult files, so don't worry about missing out. Nekopara still offers a complete and cute experience, if a little too focused on romantic pursuits. For $10, I would say it's more than worth the asking price. It's simply [b]nyanderful![/b]
This VN is really great. I actually have nothing else to say other than I shed a tear or 2 because of the story. (And aroused by patching the game...)  But you know, for the plot... A must buy if you're in to Eroge. (Or you know, buy it without patching it if you're that kind of guy)  10/10 for story, artwork, soundtrack and nekos. Lots and lots of nekos. (Chest bounciness is there too, but I'm not the one for bouncy chests)
The Cat's Meow.... That's what this game is. Cute, bouncy, tender, loving, sexy, all with gorgeously drawn characters.  The only thing not to like is waiting for the sequel.  Love these Cat Girls!
Great, game, recomend to all Anime lovers
Thinly veiled pedophilia. 0/10
Good game..recommended..
Nice
1000/10.  Really enjoyed this game (If you know what I mean, yeah, I got the 18+ version :3)  But seriously if you love cat girls and ecchi like me then this game is perfect for you.
I like the "Storyline".
chest bounciness slider is absolutely revolutionary, but press p for the real deal
Great Game that i play for the first time of me 1.Good story for begining 2.character movements 3.good graphic And Kawaii cat girls :3  It's gonna be good if you install R-18 patch XD 11/10 Good light novel
this game is so charming XD, i love everything about it c:
This game is Short but worth buy it, i play when someone share it to me (family sharing) but now i buy it, here cons that i get when i play this game cons : - Short story, for VN maniac like me its i finish this game about 22 mins (ofc with afk when something appear ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) - There's no route. - No imoutou R18 Scenes pros? go other review, :p
Ok First i have to say you only can read it like a Manga but its a little bit like a Anime too .  Firs I love this game its nice and has a cool story too . Its a must buy for every CatGirl Fan and Anime / Manga Fan in my eyes It's the best game I've bought in a long time every one should buy it .   Ps: Better Love story than Twilight . For real !
OK I'll give an honest review of this game. It's great. For £7 I don't see why you shouldn't get it.   [b]Settings[/b] People nowadays complain about how games have very limited settings. Well this game even has a "Chest Slider" which adjusts the bounciness of the chest.  [b]Plot[/b] You just moved out to open your own shop "La Soleil" as a patisserie. Prepare your anus for Chapter 5  [b]Gameplay[/b] First of all, it doesn't have any replayability. It's linear and you don't have any choices to make. Just left click or press enter to play. You will find yourself sometimes skipping through the [spoiler]sex scene[/spoiler] because it's really long (hahA GET IT? XDXDXD LOL 11/10 HUMOUR M8). Also it has animations but they are not that good.  Would recommend 7/10 Buy it now.
niiiceee good visual novel (y) bikin orang iri aja bisa hidup sama 2 kucing yang manis" xD
Why not? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A VN with catgirls in maid outfits that have a good storyline and love for you. What more could you ask for?
Chocola+Vanilla=10/10 waifus I haven't left my room in 3 years.
Awesome Game :)  11/10
First off, there is absolutely no interaction whatsoever, so set the text speed to something you're comfortable with and throw away your mouse, you'll never need it. Also the jiggly bits slider never seemed to change anything.  Lets start with the good parts. Catgirls are cute, bakeries are awesome, the uniforms for said bakery are pretty awesome, and the protagonists sister is adorable. The voice acting is about what you would expect from a title like this, nothing too special but its certainly not bad by any means. I was impressed with the E-Mote (think Live2D animations) system and animations that make the characters feel much more alive than regular old 2D could do, there are issues with this system that I'll bring up in the negative points.  I was extremely disappointed with the utter lack of interaction, no branches in story no choices, nothing. The story isn't that great and the characters don't change or grow much, but that can attributed to this being Volume 1 and also to this being less of an example of interactive fiction and more of a porn game with the porn removed. The scenario feels a bit contrived even allowing for suspension of disbelief about cat-people I never could quite find myself immersed. (I readily admit this is probably a personal failing.) The E-Mote system causes very noticeable stuttering when loading new characters into a scene; I was not the only one suffering from this problem, according to the forums.  On a more personal level, I didn't enjoy the protagonist getting together with multiple catgirls, especially given how many assets their designs reused, it just felt like two versions of the same character and I feel like the experience would have improved by just cutting one of the two characters or having two minor arcs dictated by a choice early on while leaving the one not selected as a background character.  All said, if you're excited for this title, I recommend getting the R18 version. This title is not worth the time without the explicit scenes in it and I don't even like that sort of thing.
Only complaint, game be too short.  Otherwise, the biggest bundle of Kawaii you can get packed into a pair of kitties.    On a more serious note, game plays off of common visual novel and anime tropes to create atypical girl heroines in the for of humanoid, cat and girl fusions. Needless to say all the character designs and story comes off as some of the cutest, most adorable things ever. Sure to fill your heart with a boundless fluffiness that is sure to send you floating off into the stratosphere. The game has little plot and character development, but at least it keeps it short and sweet. The game doesn't try to be anything it's not. It has a linear, no-choice story line with standard harem tropes. It's just a bundle of heart lifting love that is sure to entertain those who already enjoy the moe genre. There are fully animated scenes, and the girls and their boobs move and bounce while you talk to them. Gives you something to drool over nonetheless. While steam has removed the H-content, you can install extras here [url=http://imouto.club/?page_id=7] Imouto.club	[/url], It might not be worth the money, but it's definitely worth the time if you can enjoy cutesy things.
All the laws broken in this game -Human Trafficking  -Slavery -Polygamy -Incest -Pedophilia  I also can't look at my cats the same anymore
As illustrator i really like Sayori works.
Chest bounciness -> Max......I regret nothing......^..^/10
To start it all off, I have an innate fear of Nekos, and any form of cat girl. I was given this game as a gift, and I was too kind to say no and have their money go to waste. They asked me to play it, and that was a horrible mistake, just the introduction logo made me sick. After that, they told me to get the 18+ patch, granted, I haven't gone to far into this story, I will inevitably finish it to make them happy. After the first save, I immediately left to the bathroom to hurl. I've already set up a plan to get therapy for the mental scars this game will bring me.   If you can handle it, I'm sure you're in it for the porn or cute girls.
Don't even act like you've never had a guilty pleasure
Got The Game Becuase Of of the catgi- ..hmm i mean... Because Of How Ridiculous the Idea Was, I was Grinning and Loving the fanser-... GAME the game the whole time.  Pro tip : Press the P button, your welcome.
Kitty girls. Otakus will get aroused. Not me though... no... not me...
Just "came" for the plot.  10/10
this game is so good!!!
This game is just too adorable oh my god
i bought this game expecting porn... BUT ALL I GOT WAS TEARS! i didnt ask for these feels
NEKOS! ANIMATIONS! VOICE ACTING! JIGGLE SLIDER!!! This is the best work from these developers yet, and they made Sakura Spirit!!!
I love this.
more pussy please
There's a chest bounciness option and kawaii catgirls. Coconut is best girl though!
You will run out of tissue if you download k-18 version ;)
Like that there are animations to the characters then still images. Did really love the story. I guess the only negative is that you can't make choices in this visual novel, maybe it is because it is just set up for the whole series. I just hope if there is a next part, you will be able to make choices. If not, I think I would still buy the next part regardless.
This makes me want to fuck my cat  Thanks Obama 9/11 IGN
For teens: Great visual novel For those who wanted more out of it: Get the 18+ patch...it's great
i came 10/10 would cat again
I bought it full price now its on sale i want to kill myself good game though
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP (PS : Press P)
Truly a revolutionary visual novel. Animated from boob movement to sex scenes.  10/10, will definitely revisit in the future to research extensively. Story is okay I guess, but no one's here for that.  Now, back to molesting catgirls.
so cuttttteeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Found 2 random cats in a box, ended up sleeping with them while avoiding a creepy younger sister that wanted my D, wow this game is F#### up.  CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA... SWIRL!!!
One of the best VN out here on Steam. Introducing the eMote system really takes this Visual Novel to another level.   10/10, because catgirls! That's enough reason for a perfect score.
If you like this sort of thing than I highly suggest giving it a try. Very detailed artwork and the story has it's perks. You need to also realize this is steam also. They do have a full version on websites like jlist.com and so on... However for a sweetend down cut version that won't get you steaming in the ears and make people wonder than this is where to get this and you know the game is not that bad. Just give it a try for yourself. It is worth the look... However you don't have to take my word for it... :D
I got this game 3 days ago. This was written on 5/14/15.  I don't know how to close the game.  5/23/15 Update: It's my birthday and all I want is a big booty Chocola
Nekogirls are somenthing you didn't know you wanted until you had it. With that said, you won't find nothing except for this revelation on this VN. The story is really shallow and there is almost no conflict. Do yourself a favor and grab the 18+ version, is the only way to get excitement out of this, unless you're cool with just the "moe" characters. Another good point of the VN is the graphics, the characters sprites have emotion and move in real time, instead  of being a still picture.   Botton line: Buy this if you want some moe characters and silly dialog, or nekogirl "action" in case you got the adult version.
Great game~
If I were to ever get a girlfriend I feel that this game would've helped me do so.
Well that has to be the most interesting game in my library. Breast bounciness option... My friends keep wanting to tune into my stream... I have to watch my door at all  times and listen for footsteps so I can alt tab, Best cat girl stealth simulator 2015. 16/10
I have been judged by my 4 roommates who also saw that I have Chocola as my wall paper...I told them not to worry about it and walk away.  Nothing has been the same since that day.
I got bored and just looked up some rule 34 of Vanilla and Chocola instead.  As a Age <17 static novel the story was bland and very cringeworthy.  As a 18+ hentai the action was a bit boring for my tastes.  Who knows maybe it'll be the next Kanon and have all future versions released without erotic content and then spawn it's own anime & manga and eventually loved by all. And of course picked up by kyoto animations and we can have a true successor to clannad.   hahahahaha no
Only game where I can't decide who the best girl is.
Amazing game! JUST A M A Z I N G! Makes a grown up man very happy.
I like my cats like I like my ice cream, vanilla with chocola on top.
I now have two genetically modified cats are not static during the dialogue. What could be better = 3
Lenny face is my only face now ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[h1]Once upon a time I asked someone out to be my girlfriend.[/h1] She said no.   Now I bought NEKOPARA  Now no one can reject me ever again because  I'll have Chocola and Vanilla to cuddle up to.  I'll never have to feel that bitter pain again. Never again. Never forget.
Love this game.      *goes off to get the 18+ "patch"*
A fantastic visual novel, the animations and art style really sell it, and the music is perfect as well. A lot of people recommend patching it for the R-18 version, but be warned, it is pretty graphic. If you're new to the genre, stick to the steam version.
If you want light hearted story, with tons of fanservice and kawaii neko girls, then this is VN for you. Of course you will need a decensor patch for H content (this patch just adding H scenes, not fully decensoring a game... is is rather obvious, every Japanese game with H content is censored by mosaic), which is actually realised very well (animated scenes).  I don't regret cash which I spent on this game. I'm waiting for second vol.
fap fap fap fap fap
My friends saw I owned this game and now I eat alone. 10/10
This barely qualifies as a game at all.  There are zero choices in the game (other than maybe deciding to click on New Game or Quit Game). Other VNs in this category offer at least something that resembles separate routes.  I am so disappoint.  I mean, seriously, look at all these other reviews. It is 'fap' material, the tag 'story rich' seems to be a stretch.
Nekopara is a game where you NEED to love Nekos... and Story telling games. :3
-Chest bounciness setting  Nuff said.
10/10 all games should have a chest bouncyness setting.
ahh.  got a -rep on real life after played this. well shit....
Really nice game <3
Catgirls + Maid outfits = best game ever  10/10
For so long, I did not know the meaning of life. After being surrounded by kawaii nekos, I have finally found my way. 10/10 would seduce nekos again.
DONT                               Obviously this review shouldent be taking seriously as I was just having fun buying random things. And appearently, I got an erogue. Hurray. No, fuck this game and fuck everyone who made this shitty game. This is one of the worst games I've ever played, if not the worst. Please spend your money on candy or a piece of paper because that paper, will give you more enjoyment than this shit. EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS GAME
As someone who is an avid Anime and Manga nerd, this is definately recommended if you like gushy RomCom's.  1) It does have a few erotic scenes, but even they are done sparingly and "tastefully" enough to just add to the devloping relationships.  2) The plot is very lighthearted (which I view as good thing, not enjoying forced drama) and sweet. Had a smile on my face nearly the entire time.  3) Music is catchy, the Voice Acting is very well done, if not original at least quality.  4) The art is awesome. The only VN I've played that had art of this quality was Grisaia no Kaijitsu. (Which really needs to be put on Steam -.-)  TLDR: It's a fairly short, sweet love story with moderately interesting characters and put a smile on my face for a couple of hours. Definately worth the price. But don't play it when your parents may walk into the room. That could get embarassing
Buy this game if you want to talk to catgirls. P.S : Theres a Chest Bouncy option. P.S.S :.... They're Nekos, what more is there to say. 10/10 Would buy again. :) Bakeries are neat.
Amazing. no other words needed
This game is a very good one it has so many funny scenes and also its a very nice and emotional game!
This game makes me moist. Buy it you will NOT regret it.
Reason to get this game: You can speed run it very quickly Reason why I'm sad with this game: You can't bhop.
Came for the porn, stayed for the story ^_^
So cute, yet so wrong.
Just saw an ending. It was my first experience on game like this, but I really enjoyed it a lot.  I won't say "boob" or anything, cause I'm kinda serious now. No need to talk long. 1. Good Story 2. The cuteness is high on this one! 3. Moving body and talkin' mouth. Makes it more realistic and memorable.  The weak point is...(I judged it with my personal opinion) Short playtime. I know it's hard to make games like this, and it doesn't mean it's not worth 10$.  I r8 10/10! Just waitin' for sequel! o///w///o
First thing to remember, play offline without your friends knowing and lock the damn doors. Second, max out the bounciness slider. Third, install the R18 patch and put on your headphones. Fourth, ?. Profit!
its so cute, totally fantasy of course, but the story was injoyable and who doesnt love cute cat girl voices in japanese xD. if your a fan of the francise like me then you will know these girls, their for GET THIS GAME if not look for something ealse, because you arnt a anime lover xD!
Pros - Best 2D girls - Antidepressant - Artstyle 2good4me - Letter P is the best letter  Cons - SHORT - No wincest   I finished it with the patch. And now I'm waiting for the next volume.
had so much sex i needed a doctor  10/10
I came for the Story. I came for the Chest Bounciness. I came for Senpai. I came for the wrist breaking and I just came.  10/10 Would story again
Super cute, even without the H-scenes. Just wish it was less of a movie and more of a game. I want to win their adorable affections!
Cat girls! Cat girls!! Cat girls!!! Who doesn't love cat girls! Censorship however spoilt quite abit of the content. If you truely want to experience the game, get the uncensor patch 7/10
ba... ba... ba... BAKA !!! Its not that I wanted to play you or anythinnnng              BAKA
This is a game for those who enjoy visual novels and anime. It combines beautiful artwork and an intriguing story to create one fantastic game. Absolutely fantastic!
wow
The plot is real.
Even tho im a girl, chest bounces are on max, and I enjoy them very much.
i love this game it is so fun a must play in my book.
After an amazing night of passion with one of the female leads, the male lead comments that their relationship is one of "absolutely honest goodwill with no mind games."  Nekopara is the anti-Fifty Shades.
I loved Vanilla so much that I bought a body pillow of her. I have no need for this game anymore.  10/10
I'm usually a huge fan of these types of games, but this game had no real conflict. You do absolutely nothing but click through it. There are no decisions or options except to change the language. The graphics are really clear and the 3D idea is great, but the story is extremely boring, and I almost had to force myself to play this game. If none of this bothers you, go right ahead and get it. But if you want a game that's actually a GAME, rather than a book without a plot, then don't.

If you like catgirls, you already bought this before reading the reviews anyway.
i might be a loser irl but in this game i have my two catgirl waifus and that´s all i need
made level 5 badge and got 17 dollars in steam backgrounds  10/10 IGN
What's not to like? Anime girls thinking their catgirls and do anything for their master.  Chocola-chan and Vanilla-chan are my favourite, and then you meet Coconut.. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It feels almost like you are directly involved in the story, not just watching. It really pulls at your emotions. If you are into feelsy emotional story games, you NEED to try this one.  I feel like everyone I know may hate me if they knew I play this, but it's not like I have many friends anyway.  Catgirls 11/10-IGN
From Chapter 5 onwards, Lock door, put headphones in and do a final check to make sure coast is clear :P
You can adjust the chest bounciness.   10/10 would "play" again
Only one reason to play this game, you get to run a bakery
Joy, Despair, Joviality, Longing, Comfort, Lust;  next time you get into a heated debate on Reddit or Neogaf of whether video games are art, merely point to the diverse range of emotions that NEKOPARA: Cat's Paradise elicits.
Good Story Good Sound and music Best character Kuwaiiiiii  Just i like Vol.2 in Coming
Flew through Nekopara Vol. 1 however I loved every second of it. I smiled, laughed, sighed and even clapped my hand like a seal at certain parts in the visual novel! If you're a anime lover then it is for you :3! Great design and the artwork is superb; I cannot stress how perfect the artwork is - it's outstanding and makes it all the better! - Definitely worth the buy from me and I will most definitely purchase a further sequel when I can^  - Music is awesome, just like you'd expect for an anime! - Artwork is splenddid, full of colour and excitment! - Characters are vast, love the Chocola and Vanilla combination!  Only downside is the lack of decisions available to the player; I wish it was more hands down with choices.  Over than that I recommend it!
My bastard friend gifted this to me.   As if I didn't already have enough waifus. Vanilla~ <3    Catgirls make great waifus. 10/10
This game is amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes catgirls and visual novels. I just wish the game had choices you can make, otherwise its a good read
A serious review.... (｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡  First off, Neko Para is seriously kawai. I mean Cho Kawaiiiiiiiiii!!!  Secondly, Neko Para is seriously bouncy. How can you not be serious about the bouncy!?!?  Thirdly, Neko Para is seriously sweet. Seriously, after mere  hours of play, I had multiple cavities that HAD to be fillled.....   Lastly, Neko Para is seriously sad. No, actually seriously heartbreaking. After all, volumes 2, 3, 4....69, well, they aren't available yet.  The feelings of loss are only tempered by the feelings of joy during those few, precious hours.  Seriously fun.  Seriously love these characters! 10/10
With full on professional grade voice acting and character design, Nekopara's ~$10 price point is head and shoulders better value than any other Steam VN I've seen so far. It also features music that doesn't loop incessantly and writing that is actually pretty good even translated. If adorable young catgirls is your thing, look no further.  If you're getting into any VNs at all on Steam, get this one. It demonstrates the level of quality and production value we should eventually expect out of VNs coming from western makers.
Great game if you like anthropomorphic neko girls :) Usually I think visual novel games are crap and not worth the money but this game is worth it. The two main neko girls are extremely cute and act the exact way you would expect any anthropomorphic neko girl to act. Putting a slider in to control how bouncy their boobs are was genious although it can make it hard to focus on the actual story sometimes. I think any neko girl fan would enjoy this game :)
Awesome.
Me: Dade I love you Dade: Son what the fuck are you playing? Me: It's Nekopara dade I want you to meet my waifu Chocola Dade: ....you're adopted faggot l8er nerd     I haven't seen dade since 10/10 would be abandoned by dade again
10/10 would bang again -IGN  oh sorry i can't hear you judging cause i'm drowning in catgirls
Great game 9/10 would recommend. Enjoyed this thoroughly, however this game would be perfect if Steam left the H-scenes in the game.
10/10 Max Boner.
Good Visual Novel, Beautiful background music that really sets the mood for events like the one before you complete chapter 1, There is also a chest bounciness setting to accommodate the people expecting something to "enjoy" other than reading through the plot. Other than those, it also has a 18+ patch which features content for people expecting or wanting even more than just bouncing chests.
owo
10/10 Breast Game
I fapped to dis.
1-) Catgirls. 2-) Can ajust the Boobs Bounciness. 10/10
mai waifu
i think this is a nice game for rest or some thing it was pretty peace.  So when you play other game over you can try this ,this is a good game
No ragrets buying this game. I rate 10/10 would download again
I am a girl. I love this. It is extremely cute and inticing. While there are sexual moments, it its bogged down with it. I fell in love with these characters.
Catgirls took my virginity.  10/10 would meow again
I came
Reason To Buy This? >Cat Girls >Cute Cat Girls >Its Just Too Freaking Cute ADMIT IT  And? Just go get your wallet and buy this..i...mean.. like seriously...BUY IT.. ...all the reason you need is "CAT GIRLS" and theres no one to judge you but God... so you can just go to your room and lock the door, go get tissues and DO IT...no regrets..JUST DO IT!
WHY DID I BUY THIS?  (I regret nothing)
God Help everyone that bought this game and put the r18 version 10/10 would sin again
I don't like jerking off, it just happens.
I will never forget the words: "Deep inside" "come" "I´m coming again" O_O This game is AMAZING!
THIS IS NOT A GAME!!!  2/10  Neko para is a good animated story but it is NOT a game in any way, this is because there is NO interaction what so ever... if it would have various routes then yes it would be a game but this is just a click and watch as a preset story with no abillity to change what happens...  Dont let my review put you off but i am going to have to say you dhould not play this unless it is free or really cheap!  The only thing this game really has is its art style, the ability to make boobs bounce and a slider to enhance the bounce in said boobs... 2/10 would not recomend
v nice game lots of cute neko girls
What did humanity create this time......a guy with 2 cat girls in his house......WHO MADE THIS!?! If you guys want to enjoy some...pictures...then go right ahead!
The hentai patch made the game better, super fun  to see naked cat girls  10/10
This game will take the following from you:  Your life. Your fapping life. Your hentai induced dreams. Your Kemonomimi fetish. Your pride. Your friends. Your money.  Worth it 10/10 would do it again.
its NEKO~  Neko everywhere~   Best suite for CatGirl Lover~  its cute and the storyline have a bit Feelz......   but meh...  we'll play the game for Chocola right?  xD
Best neko simulator ever made. They seriously need to make a Vol. 2. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE NEKO GAMES
The game is OK i guess, but i think ill need to play it for a little bit more since the game takes so long to complete.
A heart-warming story with an infinite load of vanilla-ness, topping it up with good BGM's, good voice-actings, and awesome scenerey, don't forget those 'scenes' as well. What more could you ask for this awesome VN~?   *I literally had a nosebleed at Ch 5, as it was really unexpected for me for it to happen.*   Just to let all the people/players buying this game know, I am running the +18 edition, so, the steam version of this game will have cut-out scenes for it to be safe with kids below that recommended age. (I did the steps to extract the patch from the other players who are running the patched +18 edition of Nekopara [Steam version] as well)
I recenly got the achievement that said "bounce"  lol.
if u get to chapter 5 the game will be hard. very hard...........
a friend of mine got this for me after i made him play sakura spirits all i can say is screw you mr.bane
theres a button that was made only to jiggle the tiddy
neko means cat
That "P" button ruined my entire month.
Glasses-kun approves.
This game... uhmm... 50/50 I'm actually at the benning of chapter 2   Pro: - moe/10 artworks - nice animations - easy to patch to R-18 ( Steam's policy allow to purchase the All Ages version - nice BGM  Cons:  - sloppy story - no flags  I would reccomend this game only if u're looking for nice artworks and a easy "story". The story is actually boring, nice idea but not original.
I can explain.
10/10 Would cat girl again
Now everyone can see how many hours I spend fapping to cat ladies...
"Need a box of tissues or a roll of paper for that great story line. MassiveBreasts/10" -My friend Logan about the uncensored version, 2015
its funny and かわいい.
This is the best game I have ever bought. It is worth it to install the 18+ files either by torrent or purchase. Not sure how I feel about finding this on Fakku!
There's no such thing in this life is better than seeing two of my favourite character comes alive. *tears of joy*
Okay listen if you need boobs then get this game. not only is there boobs but a meter that makes them bouncier. now I know what you are thinking hey cant I just search them up, but wait listen they are CAT boobs. try finding that somewhere else. also SPOILERS your fucking sister is in love with you, but helps you bang cats. best sister of all time. god im lonley
*Mature Warning* NEKOPARA is a...... catgirl hentai visual novel. Unlike the other visual novels I described as Ecchi, this one you can get a clear picture where they cut out the erotic scenes so they were able to sell it on Steam. Having said that, it's not that bad and kind of a cute story once you get past to whole...ummm erotic moments. You read from prespetive of Kashou Minaduki, a pastry chief, opening his own cafe by himself until Kashou get two big and heavy packages containing his catgirl pets from home. They convinced him to let them stay and help him with the cafe. Two things I liked from this visual novel; it's animated and there voice acting although the voice acting is in Japanese, I assume. Also in the options menu, there "Chest Bounciness" slider and a special button on the keyboard that makes the character jump. And I give this a 9/10. *Read at your own Risk*
This is some gud shit to releks yer stress after a doto2 gaming!!! Reccomended to most otaku out there! Heart Melting
I admit, I played it. All the way through. I got every acheivement because, really, it was just too easy... Physically. Mentally, i was not prepared for this kind of... Software. I never touched a visual novel in my life up until now. Needless to say, i'm very shaken, but i will not let this deter my critique for this game. Sure, i may not LIKE the concept, and i may not LIKE the content, but i can see why someone would very much like it. It just doesn't appeal to me. The game is well made, it works flawlessly, and for my computer, the frame rate is fantastic, and i'd say i have a low-end PC. I'm just shocked how well made it is for this kind of...Software. Simply put, if you like the genere, and you like the concept, you're going to love this game. If you're new to the genre and are looking forward into committing yourself into playing more games like this... Eh, try the free visual novel before buying this. I'd reccomend it if you're a fan of visual novels. Unfortunately, i'm not, but... Eh, this is for those of you who do, so, fuck it. I'm reccomending it.
Much Love Fap Fap Fap Nuff' Said  10/10
I JUST WANT  TO SAY  NYA
it so Kawaii!!!! can't stand it anymore~ >//////<
If you are in to this kind of games then you will love it. it has a great story and nice set-up.  And you can change the boobs bounciness...  Well do i have to say more
chocola and vannila is so hani
0/10 needs more jiggle. Also, what cowards turn their steam offline? Be a man and let people be jealous of your epic win at life.   P.S. Hit "p" on your keyboard while playing :D
Lots of plot, lots ok nekomimi.  Whats not to like?  Also, I claim Maple.
Nyaa <3
Love this game it's one of my fave anime related games on steam and they are very Kawaii :) 1000/10 :)
...take it back not sure if want
I was.... Pleasantly Surprised... to say the least.   Visually Its very nice to look at and as I wasn't entirely to sure what I was getting myself into I kept going through this.   so... yeah. I mean theres the fan service and all that which is always pleasing to the eye but the plots (You know, The plot and "The Plot") are actually pretty good.   Without giving anything away, I laughed abit and almost shed a tear myself.   The best way Really I can help you make a decision here is, Theres a Reason why this Has Alot of positivity behind it and there is to be a sequel later.   Id say give it ago :).
Like call of duty with guns
This game was highly recommended to me by Fappington Fapstridge III.  He said d/l the R18 version and you won't be *fap*dissapointed.  The artwork *fap* is exquisite and the voice acting is also *fap* good.  Neko's are a thing. I'm in. *FAP*
SOOO KAWAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Nice Game ,  Cute Character
This game CHANGED MY LIFE. After my girlfriend left me there was a hole in my heart I didn't think I could ever fill again. I was no longer able to find joy in games, so when I first started up this game I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story.  I was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well. What can I say, I guess I'm just too much of a hunk! Keep playing and you might get as good as me.  The animation really makes them seem alive. I keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them. The art is not only very cute, but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters. It's even better than talking to humans. Before this game I had no one. Now I have not one, but TWO cat wives who love me! Who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally?  Even better is the immersive programming. The characters always seem to follow my eyes, and whisper my name at night. I can't figure out how you guys programmed that! Great job though.  The game is so good that I'm never going to stop playing. I'm finally happy again. THANK YOU NEKO WORKS!!!
Nekopara is a Kinetic Visual Novel (Meaning you're reading a story with no decision making from you, the player.) The story centers around a man named Kashou Minaduki, who moved away from his family, without notice, to start a new life and open up the bakery he's always wanted. However, he is followed by two catgirls named Chocola, and Vanilla; two of the six catgirls that are within the Minaduki family. The two girls want to stay and live with Kashou because they love him, and that he's their "master". This is set in a world where catgirls are domesticated much like cats, so there's an owner and pet vibe going on, but they're obviously more intelligent than cats, and can do more. The rest of the story basically settles around Kashou coping with Chocola and Vanilla while trying to maintain the business and order of the bakery, and how the catgirls are going to affect his life and relationship with them.  This is a rather lighthearted story with lots of cute, funny moments coming from the two girls. A positive is that this story is fully voice acted (In Japanese), has animation thanks to a program called "E-Mote" where facial and body animations are possible, and a wonderful, casual soundtrack that's very memorable, and calming to listen to. There's also a decent amount of CG art that's made for specific scenes, with a little more detail.  Obviously, this story isn't for everyone. Like I said, it's a lighthearted story with funny moments and admittedly heartwarming chapters. You can really get attatched and connected to the characters if you're up for a tale such as this one. The story has lots of moments such as Chocola and Vanilla acting all cutesy and purring, meowing, stuff like that. People would be split on this depending on what you like, but I personally find that super adorable and makes the characters much more likeable.  It's not just that though, there is character development, and the story does actually go somewhere. It's not so much slice-of-life if you were thinking that. It mainly revolves around Kashou's relationship with Chocola and Vanilla, the bakery's business, and the girls earning their "bells" (Which you'll learn as you read along.) There is quite a few things going on, and the story never feels like it's halthing in one spot for too long.  If you like this kinda story, love catgirls, or are a fan of anime, then this is for you, it's vey polished and well done for what it is, and I was honestly surprised and what i got myself into. The story will take about 5-7 hours to read completely.  9/10
You will never look at your cats in a same way again.
10/10 Would pastry puff again.       ...I regret nothing.
Tell me again why it isn't a federal offense to not play this?  I mean, Chocola and Vanilla [i]are[/i] the best catgirls in the world. They're practically goddesses and should be worshipped as such.
...Well, I have no regrets.
Chocola is best waifu.
兄妹、人兽、双飞，我已经报警了XD  Two kemonomimi waifus,a clingy imouto,and 4 potential waifus!!!!  [spoiler]  I played the steam version once for achievements and the steamy version serveral times for ************.  [strike]8P to maximum!  Not until I found myself enjoy reading this did I realize I was a radical hentai! [/strike] [/spoiler]  Whew! I swear that was a gift!!!  [spoiler] ----------------------------------------------- Well,what I think truly about this VN is : It sucks.If you ever heard about a kind of sucky novels named "Mary Sue",ok now this one should be a "Tom Sue". [/spoiler]
The visuals were presented very nicely and excellent voice acting. It's a bit short though.  But yeah, I was BLOWN away by the game and the story was very heart POUNDING, I really got BANGED up playing it in one playthrough. haha!
It was the best game I haven't played.
This is not a dating sim.  There are no choices and thus only one route.  Strictly a linear visual novel.  Place coffee cup onto your space bar to get to the end.  I paid money for this and it was not what I wanted.  Had I known what it was I wouldn't have bought it.  I therefore cannot give it positive review.
The Devs know their audience. Cat girls, lewdness, and a shallow as fuck story. If I had to rate the lewdness on a scale to one to ten, I would give this game a fucking twenty. It's fucking ridiculous. I mean, I bought this game because my friend said I had no balls. I proved that man wrong. #didn'tevenread
this is not porn
I got this game for the cute catgirls and erotica. Instead, I found myself sympathizing with Chocola and Vanilla and investing myself into their characters  There's also a chest bounciness setting, which is the most revolutionary thing in gaming since R.O.B. saved the industry
Uhh at first this looked like a 9.5/10 or 10/10 my final rating is.....7/10...it kinda collapsed after the "catpanions" part.  SPOILERS [spoiler]...firstly no way should they get jealous and definitely not be able to voice it and he is "okay" with that. The guy is a pushover, no problem being with them, but being loyal and committed is taking it too far. No way that a relationship with an unintelligent creature like that should be taken seriously...The twin catgirls  jealously and pride was annoying as if they had "rights".....[/spoiler]  But overall a good game, I could see Vol. 2 being very good!! Add more catgirls to the pot!!
if you have nekopara  you dont need gurlfriend remember that
Can adjust chest bounciness - 10/10 would adjust again
I regret nothing
don't worry, you will not regret it ;)
This game is actually a clever political statement about the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. A group of people treated as second-class citizens? Being forced to identify themselves with easily identifiable bling? Being detained simply for existing without identification? This is Schindler's List for Generation Y. Or it could be a condemnation of American facism. It works on so many levels.
Story: B- Most, if not all of its story elements can be commonly found in lots of Anime and Manga. However, It's clear that the story is told in a way where few people would find it to be a major problem. Though I must say the story is short - You can probably 100% it in under 2 hours. Art: A+ In my knowledge, this game is one of, if not THE first games to use E-Mote System for its character arts. And the result? Perfect. Music & SE: B+ It's not perfect material compared to the great companies such as KEY's works, but the Music and SE in this game follows and sets the mood well. The voice acting is also a plus. System: A With all the animations and stuff, the game still runs smoothly on an average laptop.  Final Rank: A Recommended. Not a waste of money even if bought without a sale.
I love cat girls so this game was perfect for me as it had both cats and get this right, and it had girls! WOW :O 10/10
wasting money for such a vn without any route
Literally surrounded by Hot catgirls, would bathe with them again. 10/10
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 isn't so much a game as it is a powerpoint tour-de-force. I haven't been so satified in many different ways from a powerpoint since I first installed Crysis on my Emachines back in 2008. If you think this is a joke review, then I don't blame you; NEKOPARA does not look like much aside from the cute girls and words dancing under their customizibly bouncy chests, but what it offers is a true deconstruction of the slice-of-life archetype, and this alone makes the journey worth embarking.  I do not wish to spoil much, but NEKOPARA Vol. 1 tackles sensitive themes such as human trafficking, slavery, genetic modification, violations of the Geneva Convention, the politics of a cross-species society, and beastiality. The unnamed town our protagonist moves to is clearly that of a monitored police-state, not unlike that of City 17, where the upper-class rule over the lower-classes with an iron fist. I can say no more, but holy shit. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 does not hold back.  It really does sound like I'm making shit up, but this is honestly not a joke. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 hides it's true nature under what looks to be a shallow fap, kind of like a convincing trap. But unlike a trap, it didn't stop me after the fact. All I can say is that this is a better present than Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme, and if you had to make a choice, go with this. You will be surprised.
[b]This. Is not. A game.[/b] This is a subtitled anime. Correction: this is a subtitled [u]motion comic[/u]. There are no choices. There are no controls more elaborate than those on a video player. There are somthing like 50 save slots. [b]WHY?![/b]  I wasn't expecting much, but this is literally nothing but pretty. And possibly a slightly weird commentary on slavery.

Do you even need to read my review to want it?
After one hour I had to stop because I had a bad case of the feels..
The Best Graphics
Bought steam version, Patched in R-18 Version, Played game and got to sex scenes, Was a happy man, Got to the end, Cried cuz i have to wait for part 2  10/10 .....I want nekopara again!
good but no H scene
Ouch. My face hurts from having a smile plastered on my face for the better part of a half-hour. First game to ever make me take breaks.
“A cat is fine too…”
Definitely a must buy in my opinion :) Has a good plot and the characters really are very lifelike and likeable. The in-game soundtrack is hands down one of the best that I've experienced in a game before and overall just a really good game. Neko Works did an amazing job on this and I'm already impatiently waiting for the release of Volume 2 ;)
Promotes borderline pedophilia and connects me with my inner weeb.
Soo cute. If you like catgirls and fluff read it. Yes it's not a game, it's a Visual Novel.
Cats,Girls,Cats,Girls.
Give me the next volume. I have more girls to do.
This Visual Novel is made of cute.  The artwork is amazing, the music is great, and all the characters are likeable.  If you're looking for something adorable to sooth your weary soul, this is the thing.  Buy it.  Buy it now.  Notice how that wasn't a suggestion.  You must buy Nekopara.  You need this in your life.
Never wanted to go to offline mode faster.  All numbers/10 made me raise an eyebrow at my cat.
Catgirl paradise. 'nuff said.
"What is this, some kind of wonderland?!" -My friend, upon seeing this game for the first time.  He was right.
catgirls/10
This game isn't even that lewd.  My micropenis is disappointed.
The story is as good as Bioshock Infinite, I'm not kidding its that good.  And since it feels more like an anime, i'd go so far as to say it would be my number four, only because the likes of steins;gate, elfen lied, and shin sekai yori already take the top three. The character development is amazing, you don't see that kind of thing everday, It asks extremely important questions that are NEVER asked normally and slams haters in one fell swoop. Does sharing blood make you love someone. No, love is earned. The memories you make create your bonds and just how far you would go for them shows your love. What do family "ties" have to do with expressing your love. Not a damn thing. Isn't being gay wrong? You still haven't realized the physical equipment you're given is just that and has no bearing whatsoever on who you are or who you care for? Isn't love supposed to be a one on one thing? Totally the choice of the lovers and no one else. This story DESTROYS the false concepts society has erected regarding love. And even gets into racist/speciesist issues. Damn perfect 10/10  P.S. I would say the 18 version adds to the story as some of the most crucial character development happens during the ommitted scenes, yes they are a bit tiring and overdone but since its done in service of the story I have no complaints.
When it comes to "cute cat-lady" trust me, you wouldn't ignore them just- trust me...  BUY IT!!
Nice Novel. Storyline has many emotion in it. So funny and heartbreaking at some points. Really want this to have a Vol.2 and beyond. And if possible I would like it to have multiple ending such as bad ending. Maybe the other ending for volume 1 is the Master get very sick after running to save his cats that forget their bells. Just Maybe
Ultral epic! Can't wait for Vol. 2!
NOT THE COMPELETE VERSION, THE 18X CONTENTS HAS REMOVED.  8/10
No regrets here 10/10
All 14 achievements... "Well I have no regrets."
They let me into the Salty Spitoon after I told them I played this game without going offline. That and they saw the size of my right arm.  +cute catgirls +R-18 patch +makes you forget there's a story +chest bounciness bar +primary arm strength  11/10
For those who did find this 'game' on steam: Do you REALLY need any comments? Just BUY it. 10/10
The most cutest game i ever played !!! ^_^
gr8 m8 i r8 8/8
NO STAP!!! I DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO REALITY!!!! LET ME STAY WITH MY CATGIRLS!!
I'm in love with the coco
Played a bit. The [i]plot[/i] is good.
PLS I NID MORE CATSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS AND CATSSSSSSSSSSS CATSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Fun game but I had a few problems. While the aniamtion were great and so were the details in the artwork. It was really rather short. However even given it was seemingly only 3 chapters long the artwork and story far surpasses the shortness in story in my opinion and would recommend this to any anime and visual novel fans.
it kinda hurts my feelings when the master rejects them both to stay  oh well, happy ending after all
After completing the game in just about 5 hours I can honestly say that this game is one of the best Visual Novels that I purchased from Steam.  It's silly, heartwarming, and serious.  I honestly cried when I played some of the scenes, and I am in my early 20s.  As a guy and as a fan of Anime I give this a 10 out of 10.  I would absolutely pay for this again.
This game is love this game is life and it is just so purrfect
I giggled a lot
I played thought this game 2 times now the none H-Verson and once with the H-Scenes and i got to say i love this game it is Cute and really well made. I for one can't wait for a Vol.2 and if it never comes i'll be greatly dissapointed but untill than i am just going to re-read this great game most likly wioth the H-Scenes but as a few other people said in the past, If you are going to read it with H-Scenes it is best to do so with in your own room where no one can just walk in and see it unless your family/friends don't care. i am guessing it could be awkward.  Also Cocola and Vanilla are my 2 favourite catgirls love them.
Catgirls are the best The steam version is censored I have no shame nya  Ok really though + Fully voiced, catgirls, really expressive characters thanks to the engine, catgirls  -  Fairly short, goofy plot, linear with no choices, censorship   Really it all comes down to how you feel about catgirls  Which is great, you feel great.
I loved the idea of Nekopara. I loved the artfully crafted characters and the animations were adorable but i literally just watched a novel. As the player, you gave no feedback, no choices and no oppurtunities to make the story your own. As a player who usually maxes out games but completing every inch and every acheivment and averages about 30 hours in  dating sims, I only got an hour and a half of enjoyment out of this attrocity, and all of it was spent wondering if the game was ever going to let me play. For a game as beautiful and visually enticing as Nekopara, I was gravely disapponted. If Vol. 2 has any improvments on implementing choice in the gameplay I might look into it but for now I'll stick to my 44th hour spent maxing out Huniepop.
A rather heart-warming story, I couldnt help but play to the point wear I had to tear away from my PC to go to work! Cant wait for a Vol.2 Stayed away from the 18+ update floating around, the story is fine the way it is!
They talk funny lol
Neko, neko, even more neko and then neko I guess ? For the plot, I swear.
10.3/10 would bang catbabes again
10/10 This game made me feel very sexually confused, afterwards I didn't know if i liked cats or girls maybe both. My friend slapped me because i sexually assaulted a cat named moto. This game has made me a dangerous individual and socially unacceptable, more so than i already am.
Ahhh this VN has made me fall out of my chair, cry rivers and lose my breath on multiple occasions, generally due to immense amount of laughter or daaawwww moments. Its well written and has nice transitions for whenever something is being taken into reference (recalling an event or such)  I took a while to start it up but once i did there was no getting me to stop it till the end and i can say wholeheartedly that this is among my favourite VNs ive played/read over the years, sure there arent any choices to be made but i dont mind, for the price thats asked id say its worth it. Its not got any big drama in it nor any looming *doom* hanging over it per say, its more Chocolatey with a sprinkle of Vanilla so as to not make it too.... single coloured :-)  Would have to say the production value in Vol. 1 is pretty darn good, didnt notice any bad scenes and the transition between still images to animated ones felt natural. Also love the options (youll see what i mean;-)   9/10 from me (cant be 10 yet as the series isnt done) ^^
This game is perfect. 10/10
The same feel as I was watching the Lovelive! and date·a·live. I can't stop  T_T.
Super fun, super cute. Cat girls. Buy it. Play it. Love it. Cat girls.
This is an A+ example of a game that focuses entirely on fan service to the detriment of having anything of substance.  The setting makes no sense whatsoever. Catgirl biology makes no sense whatsoever (and whatever CAN make sense is completely counter-intuitive). Culture with catgirls makes no sense whatsoever.  Nothing works. It's something you have to completely shut your brain off to be able to enjoy because otherwise the fact that nothing makes any sense will completely ruin it.  It is also worth mentioning that I've played games that were far worse in the fan service department that still put a lot of effort into making everything as sensical as possible. It's very disappointing to see a game like this have some potential to be interesting and just bungle it this badly.  (To explain the playcount, I played this off of steam. I only bought it for the achievements.)
Ok, after those long hours in the game I've finally reached a conclusion about it, I have a weird obsession for nekos and/or lolis. Anyways I'm gonna throw ya some pros and cons   [b] Pros: [/b] + Nekos + Lolis + Awesome story and most probably a second part of it. + Nekos + If you manage to get the +18 version, you won't regret it. wink wink* + If your family catch you playing it you will be buffed with the "disappointed stare" status for the rest of your life. + Probably the same with your friends. + Nekos, lolis and a lot of best girls and potential future waifus. + But w/e who needs friends and family when you have nekos and lolis? + At some point you'll get the status and award "what am I doing with my life" + Did I mention nekos? anyways, nekos.  [b] Cons: [/b] - [spoiler] It have a lot of pros [/spoiler]  [b] TL:DR [/b] Buy it, if you're into VN's and/or eroges
For all the neko lovers out there, I highly recommend. Amazing story, fantastic art, and overall simply adorable. If you want your heart to be melted by nekos, then get this game.
Kawaii/10
Good story and physics.
lewd/10
Nekopara is love. Nekopara is life.
wonderful, emotional story, sometimes sad, sometimes happy, tis a great one, go get it (plus theres nekos!!!!)
"Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow" - Chocola  This game has some of the most varied and original writing I have read in years. Seriously, I have not seen anything this intelectually stimulating since Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky. I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who has even a passing interest in fine literature.
Buy it . . . Baka.
Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~! Nyan~!    ~ Thank you for reading ~
I will admit, I fapped to this. Twice.  Catgirls are love, Catgirls are life.
MY GOD, WHAT DID I BUY???????  You'll laugh till your blue, and cry till you laugh again.  Best $10bucks i ever paid for laughs.  (Yes I know what this is, but its still massivelly funny)  Worth it.  P.S.  Boob Jiggle slider in options: L   M   F   A   O!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How do I quickscope?
What I love about this:  - Story  - If you search on google how to unlock the 18+ version you will find a link that all they request is to not give out the direct link.  What I hate about not only this VN but all the other VNs on Steam:  - Censorship becuase South Park can make all the abortion and other incredibly crude and obscene jokes and even have a scene where a guy screws a donkey, but this is still censered.   - It's short but Vol. 1 shows this isnt the only one that will be so dont worry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2SL83k3IFk  >mfw I enjoy this game
Would play again, makes you want ur own catgurl  20/10  (be sure to install the 18+ mod)
One word "Neko".      [b][spoiler]10/10[/spoiler][/b]
>buy steam version >also buy R-18 version >patch in R-18 scenes >profit
To be honest, I really enjoyed this title. From beginning to end i had a nonstop smile on my lips and i really could not find anything that i did not like! from the characters to the story, in my eyes everything just seemed perfect. The graphics and such seemed spot on and the Mechanics were humorous. I would gladly recommend this game to just about anybody who loves the Visual Novel genre or those who are into Romantic and Comedic storylines. Heck if your a "Catgirl" fan like myself, i will unashamedly add, then i have 100% no doubt that you will enjoy this amazing experience. Oh, and i lied when i said there was nothing i did not like, in fact there is one thing. I REALLY CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT! Hah, alright that is all.
10/10. Eagerly waiting for Vol.2  Nyaa~~
I don't have a girlfriend, but now I don't need one.
Nekos with their boobs bouncing. 100/10
Nekos, that is all.
Personally i would've wish for more neko parts and comedy than the much feelings talking - that's all with my negative points. The art is on highest level and varied with chibi-style beside, the e-mote system makes everything more lively, the music is nice and stays in my ears... like a curse. It has a short but non-stupid story and the hentai parts aren't boring "vanilla" (haha, you understand, like the catgirl... sorry, Vanilla) - even the most worrying domains are done well.  I patched the hentai parts in afterwards and it's not just a few content that would be missing - so i'd recommend it to others too, but gladly it's not something that's absolutely needed, not an important part of the story.  This game filled my Valentine's Day, so i wasted no thought on my single life - quite a blessing. 2nd volume is definitely bought!!!
Really weak as far as Story goes. I mainly purchased the game for the cute girls but even then they felt very bland and dry. If you're looking to just play a game with some cute art of Neko girls this is for you but otherwise don't bother.  Edit: Wow just found out this was an adult game with the scenes cut out. That explains heaps
Fap Diary, Day 10:  The catgirls have not yet noticed that I've moved the chest bounciness slider to the maximum setting. So far, it appears that both Cinnamon and Coconut respond most favorably to the changes, but more observation is needed to see how this change affects the other nekos.  10/10, E-Mote is the way of the future
+BEST GAME EVER DAMN VANILA AND MAPLE SO CUTE !!!!!!!!    I ADMINT THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD +
Lovely Cats.what else should i say? Best GalGame Ever.
Came for tha boobs stayed for tha plot  PS. P is a useful button
Great visual novel 10/10  :D <(^W^)>
The best game I have ever played in my life. I am so glad to be alive right now. Yes. It is better than bacon.
I give this game a 10/10 because catgirls, that's why.
Wow! This is just amazing. Cute, sexy, funny, great music, great story and wildly entertaining! Did I mention it has cat girls?! I simply LOVE this and am very glad I bought it!  Only things negitive I can say about it is; -I can't consider this a 'game' since there is no choice or options. It's more like a animated manga or anime. Very liniar. -Could always use more cat girls and characters. -An option for english dub would attract a larger group of people, but I for one LOVE the japanese voices and english subtitles. It's very well done, I can tell they put a lot of time into the subtitles.   Just, BRAVO. *Clap, clap, clap*
I like catgirls.
good
Nice light novels, definitely a must-try game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQgsROTqSjY  A fun visual novel that has cat girls, with dashes of comedy and feelings :D  Just remember to press "P" when characters are present.
Boring and gay.
good game annnddddd i do not regret buy it xD * please steam release the 18+ patch please ;)  don't hesitate to buy it folks O3O
What a game.
I hope my coworkers won't find out.
[b]NEKOPARADISE[/b] is a visual novel where you'll meet beloved cat girls which will make you dream and think about this incredible world. The art, and the sound are just perfect. If you're fan of VN, don't hesitate to buy it.
10/10 Cute Cat Sisters 10/10 Boob Bouncing  10/10 Awkward Conversationa on Steam from friends
A very cute visual novel, recommended for cat lovers and visual novel lovers, all-ages and 18+ players!
The game ,,its dynamic effect is good .This is one of the most human GALGAME in the world than ever before ,I think .IT IS GREAT!!
now i know what true happiness is ...    thank you neko paradise thank you    NyanNyan/10
good game
I bought this on Steam.  Then I bought it on DLSite...  Then I preordered a physical copy with bonus swag...  I'd do it over again if I could.  Actual review: PROS: -nekos -spot-on comfortable TL -2kawaii5me CONS: -shoooort. -steam doesn't like the full-featured version
This isn't really a visual novel, nor is it a game. It's really just a show that you can control the pace of, you can pause it when you want, you can choose the language, and thats about it. I would recomend it as a show to watch, but as a game that it is advertised as, I can not recomend it.
Hmm...maybe i should order some boxes. see if got any cat inside.
It's a cute history about a owner and his cute nekos. And there's Chest Bounciness! NEKOPARA Vol.1 is totally worth your money, just buy it and come to the Neko Paradise!
It is amazing!!!!!
Amazing.
It's Ok. But you really gotta be into the Animoo's if you want to 'play' this. I understand it's a visiual novel, but it still irks me that it's counted as a game.
+ VN full of neko girls and chibi art + great E-mote System + nice BGM  recommended for VN fans... :3
I've never cried this much, i mean i used whole box of tissues because of too much plot  5/5 would cry again and press P
Oh god, why am I even playing this?  10/10 catgirl delusions
Worth buy this game ffs (for [spoiler]fuck[/spoiler] sake)  -Buy this game  -Get the Uncensored Version (R18+) -Get a tissue -Get a Headphones -Lock the door -Play this game at midnight  -Play until chapter 5 -Brace yourself -Chapter 10? (It contain sum feeeeeels)  -Play the game second time after you finish it for the first time -After play the whole game at the second time, it should be unlock the scene gallery  10/10 Fap Material  Bought to you by IGN , NEKOWORKs Sponsored by Dorritos , Mountain Dew , Illorminati , 4:20 FM (Saints Row IV game)  Team Sponsors by FaZe , Eclipse Gaming , Optic  "10/10 would buy this game for quickscuping, if u know wat i mean" -Xy "10/10 would be my new masturbation material" -Kuroneko (Ruri Gokou) "10/10 would fap" -Kyousuke  "10/10 would buy if the Vol. 2 is out" -Xy   The FAP Simulator is REAL
I never thought I would get pussy, until now. 10 out of 10in
its called art you uncultired swine
This game is something to behold. Ive wasted my data trying to play this game from my phone at school. Also you should man-patch it ;)
The plot is amazing in this game.     alright now a bit seriously.  i played the 18+ version of it and "sad" to say i wish i played the steam version, the H scenes kinda made the game worse because i loved the story behind the characters. can't really say alot about this game without spoiling it but when you read this story, it feels like this. http://i.imgur.com/w8fIA.gif
NIce fluffy VN with great music, animation, characters and of course... catgirls!   :3  11/10  Don't forget to press P in game!
Guess it's my own fault for playing Nekopara while concurrently playing F/SN visual novel.  Compare to F/SN, everything about this game is just so one dimensional, it's almost no different than browsing through Pixiv.  Except in this game, you only get to browse slight variations of images of the same 6 or 7 characters, chapter after chapter.  =P  I will still give props to everyone involved in this project, for bring visual novels of this production quality to the Steam platform.  And that's probably the main reason I bought this game, to support the pioneers of high production-quality VN on Steam. XD  Otherwise, I would not recommend this game.  P.S. I did purchase both the Steam and the Japanese Uncut version.
my wrist, it hurts
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make baking my romance option.  10/10
I wouldn't call this a game. It's a really cute story though that makes you laugh and cry at how incredibly adorable it is! An uptight brother who never dealt with love, two adorable twin catgirls, and a sister doting and crushing on her older brother? WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED!?!?! Soo my question is.. When is Vol. 2 coming out? XD
Got 2 overwhelmingly cute nekogirls as my life partner. Instantly completes my life.  PROS : - BEYOND GODLIKE SAYORI-SENSEI'S arts, checked - Amazing voice acting, checked - Quite interesting story, checked - Nekogirls, checked - Even more nekogirls, checked  CONS : - VOLUME 2, EFFIN' WHERE?!  RATE : Insta-buy Volume 2 when it's released/10  ... ... ...  Unofficial DLC :  - A certain patch exists somewhere on the internet ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Catgirls, Cakes and Voiced very well (with the exception of the MC) this was worth the $10 i payed for it.
Chocola and Vanilla are my two special catgirls. Master loves his catgirls because they're like dau-um Chocola what are yo-HOOOOOOOOOOOOLYYYYYYYYY F-    gifted it to friends to share the glory of Cat Paradise. 11/10  Chocola is Waifu of the Year Vanilla wins Pantsu of the Year.  Screw Kawaii, Be Sugoi.
10/10  playable with one hand
NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My life has lost any discernible direction.
I plan to beat it four times.... the game of course ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
One of the Best VNs You could get on Steam, nyaaa~
a very good game but best played at night.
Needs more options for boob bounciness. 4/5
You have sex with cats... 11/10
it was gifted i swear ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nekopara (Cat Paradise) Is a very cute visual novel about catgirls being mixed in the world and well about if cats were able to live in human forms.  Story is based on a rich guy who likes baking and opens a baking shop by 'running' away from home and then suddenly... Catgirls appear who are called by Vanilla and Chocola.  It is a cute story but nothing really gets done other then perversion and cats.. lots and lots of cats.  Now other then that the Pros and Cons.   Pros: Music is great and the animations for a visual novel is something I have never seen before and looks well detailed and something that is amazing on your eyes to look at. OH and boob jiggling settings you should max out before starting.   Cons: Not much story but the cuteness and personality of the characters tends to make you forget that there is basically.. not much of a story...  Hopefully they put more story in Vol.2 but I wouldnt complain very much if it was alot like this one.
I love nekomimi's. This game is awesome if you love mimi's like me, but this is not a game as it is a graphic noval. I dont really care for this types of novals, but its nekomimi's so thumbs to you mates... 5/5 for just the nekomimi's...
All my years of life has boiled down to me buying this game.  Worth it.
IZ RLY GRD
-Pros Nekos Nekos Nekos Nekos Nekos  -Cons  Needs even more nekos.
5/5 would play again
this game is creepy and wierd the eye movements of the catgilrs is like staring into the eyes and soul of satan himself 10/10 would stare at satan again
Top tier visual novel. Quality story and has probably the best use of CG & hand drawn art that I've seen together.   Also technology.
Explaining to your friends why you play a certain game has never been this awkward
we can learn chinese language from this game (some of the language, lol)
0/10 took 3 hours to uncensor.
The  Story is fantastic. The Charakters are very nice and cute, and i like the sync. For my the best "game" in this kategorie on Steam   -------BUT is Better with the R-18 patch :P Normaly its a H-Story. I read some very "special" stuff and with teh R18 Patch (its not a mod, its like the JP version 1:1) it is Perfect)  (mor infos about the patch? ask me;P)
No decision making at all. BUT I LOVE CHOCOLA!!! <3 <3 <3
i am not sure it is a game? but story is great classic asian style mystery semi scifi love (and yes i am pretty sure that is classic in japan)
Gameplay?  What's that?  True gamers only read dialogue for 50 hours.  Game over.  Get rekt kid.  Git good.
Best h-scenes I've ever seen...
Came for the boobs stayed for the boobs.  And A little hint P is a useful button.
....Mom this isn't what it looks like I swear.
I'm very new to the whole visual novel thing... I love anime and I love manga. So why not? First 10 minutes into this game and I absolutely fell in love with the characters. The character you play as is kind of a jerk at the start, but he comes to reality that two cat girls want to stay with him... so he lets them :3   The animation of the characters is a little weird for visual novels i think, but I really like it. It adds a little more life to the characters. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who likes anime or manga.  (There is an R18 version you can get/patch... worth)
If anyone tells me to save the Earth.  I will save all the catgirls of the world and flee to a distant planet.  Then, I shall create a world deticated to catgirls.  A planet where i shall rule all the catgirls in the world, and press p forever.  Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce. BOUNCY BOUNCE.
Whilst I was playing this, I forgot about my gf.
I know Nekopara before it goes to steam, and shocked when it comes to steam VIA steam Greenlight! It's a Dream Come True man!!!!! thanks Sekai Project for distributing it to Steam, thanks to Nekowor--  #sfx from A :Who the hell want to know that, tell us about your review!!!  Oh.....uhm....right-right, this a good VN....[more good if you have 18+ patch 030] -good Graphic, with bouncing animation -good story -good character design  ///Reccomended Visual Novels!!///  "100/100 damn kawai!" "100% Genuine Neko-neko"
I got this game for Valentine's day. That's all
The game is awesome. I enjoyed it. I highly recommended this game for those who visual novel game. :D  I hope for those who bought this game will enjoy it as much as I did. Kanpai!!!!
I've been a fan of Sayori's artwork for years now, and I've waited anxiously for a day that Neko Works would produce some kind of game with her gorgeous artwork. It's finally here, and it's everything you could ask for: HD artwork, fully voiced, and a high quality emofuri-inspired animation engine. Seeing these characters come to life outside of art books and short ero comics gives me huge moe feels.  You should buy this if you obsess over catgirls or are looking for another short VN to play. Pick up the original ero release on DLsite too. :chocola:
http://youtu.be/YVQubGNXC7U?t=35s  Nekopara in a nutshell.
I SWEAR IT WAS A GIFT ITS NOT LIKE I PLAYED IT EVERY TIME
If you ever feel down then you need to play this game.  NekoPara is a lovely game that takes you in the story of 2 catgirls. The storyline is great , also the music makes you feel happy ^_^  This is a true hentai game without the R18 scenes. I would recommend to play the full version with R18 to get the complete feeling of the story.  This is not a dating sim but more a linear story driven game , this game just takes the player as the main character in the game. It's like reading a novel, there are no choices to choose from. You just need to click ( or press the same button on your gamepad ) to advance the story.  After you completed the story you have finished volume 1 then the game ends. The story in this novel game makes you very happy and fun. You will learn more emotions of the characters while you advance. Just play this game in a quiet environment , listen to the voice and music with english subs and enjoy!  10/10
Really beutifully animated and even voiced. Must have been a lot of money put into this game. However playing it is a bit of a culture shock. Can be a bit too kawaii for some folks.   I myself found the game to be among the few that makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrased on a constant basis while playing.   There was once a time when I could embrace the ...moe of such a genre but that time has passed for me. If hyper kawaii is your style don't hesitate this VN is pretty refreshing in terms of style.   For everyone else like me you will open this game and be pleasantly suprised by the game and then suddenly overcome with questions relating to civil rights. Do the cat people die at the age of 20 like most felines? Do they have SS numbers? Do they have rights? These cat people seem to be sentient hybrid creatures that humanity perhaps created. Are they sent on suicide missions like many animals during the early space program? Do their lives have less value than a human life? If you hit one with your car can you just drive off without finding the owner the way that it is in the US?  Many questions either way enjoy the game.
its ok
Writing a review to represent those of us who made a mistake.  If there were less than 100 reviews, I wouldn't submit because it's probably not fair for me to judge.  **I have never seen Anime, nor played a game like this.**  Decided to try it on a whim because Princess Robot Bubblegum from Grand Theft Auto IV makes me laugh everytime I watch it, and I adore Japanese women.    Apparently you need more than a love of Japanese women and a positive genre impression to love a game like this.  I'm clearly out of my league.  I went into it with no expectations, and somehow came away disappointed.  There's no game here, but it's a visual novel, so I didn't expect one.  But for a novel, the writing reminds me of Judy Blume or some adolescent paperback pulp like the Babysitter's Club.  I appreciate the bouncing breasts, but was surprised the animation doesn't strike me as good as South Park: The Stick of Truth... a low bar, to be sure.  Yet reading other reviews, this appears to be an exceptional addition to the genre.  I guess the genre is going to have to evolve before I give it another go, though.
thank god you only need one hand to play this game
Art 2 Gud.
Note: I thought the R18+ version added extra story content. As far as I can tell, it does not - it simply adds in pornographic scenes (maybe 30 minutes worth). If you're not after Nekopara for its original eroge form, it's probably not worth finding the R18 version (it doesn't add anything).  THAT BEING SAID, it's an absolutely great kinetic novel - no choices - with a fun story, fully voice acted, and catgirls. Probably 5-6 hours of story.  And who can say no to catgirls?
GOTY Edition
"It's not hentai it's art."
I would start killing for the second volume of the game. I'm serious. TOTALLY. THI GAME IS MLG NOSCOPE 360, SO YOU BETTER TRY IT BEFORE I KNIFE YOU :3   * Anyway, the game is worth playing if you like visual novels, or if it's your first time non-the-less. You get pretty much amazing experience from the art of the game, sometimes I even started crying how good it was. So, thanks for the game devs! But buying the adult 18+ version is totally worth it, too, as it doubles the faptime.... THE EXPERIENCE I MEANT. Have fun ;D
I got this game as a gift. Don't judge me!  But catgirls are kinda cute.
I love cats. I love girls. I'm no pervert. Not at all.
I liked the the game quite a bit.  Nice graphics with moving characters (something you don't see often), cute characters and a sweet story. BUT and thats a big minus: it's short... too short for the money i've paid. I needed around 5h and that got me a little dissapointed. Only hope i got is that the next volumes won't be this short or a bit less expensive.  But all in all it was still worth it.
I love this game! The characters are well designed. And it is impressive you managed to animate them!
NEKOPARA Vol. 1  Ahh, what a great game. I enjoy my story in any game I play, and this had tons (hoping for a vol 2). Although the 18+ version has more in it, the steam version is still great. Lovely artwork, the characters are supurb, and the soundtrack is heavenly. I give this a 10/10 (15/10 if it was the adult version). Although it is quick, its great. OH! AND U MUST JIGGLE THE SCREEN! PRESS P!!!  Enjoy
It changed my life, i'm a better human being now
Studies shows that every guy who ever played this game has an increase in awareness for their surroundings.  i'll give it 199/200 for the social and health benifits.
This game is so adorable! It features a story rich plot, amazing music, wonderful original Japanese voice acting. You take a role of Kashou Minaduki trying to become one of the best patissier out there. Although he's accompanied by 2 main catgirls; Chocola and Vanilla and also VERY cute sister of his Shigure Minaduki, who's a bit... well... let's just say she have a very BAD brother complex. Rest of the catgirls features Azuki, LEWD Cinnamon, Coconut and Maple. It's a game that truly messes up your feelings. A MUST GET visual novel out there. Guys at the Sekai Project and NEKOWORKs has really outdone themselfs yet again. It's a story that you don't want to miss and just want to keep playing on over and over again.  10/10
me: no one understands me like the catgirls do mom: son, come home me: [b]I AM home[/b]
amazing game very well done would have prefered if it had a h-scene option but thats just me cannot wait for the other volumes if there are other ones
it is a nice game and i really like playing it when i have my leisure time. The plots are interesting.
This is a steam version so if you want the R18 patch you have to downoad it but for some people the achivements are blocked because of it but i dont really care what i'm missing because its a great game regardless since i dont have the patch   oh i have completed the game and unlocked 13 achivements yet there is a 14th which isnt shown cause its hidden within (God mode makes the characters jiggle) [its one letter ive used 4 times in this review]
<3
100% worth
Steam: Where gaming and masturbation go hand in hand at a fappable price. 10/10: would buy again.
Touching story... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ...really touching ( ͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)
SO GOOOD! I WANT THEM!
Favourite VN so far, animations run so smoothly, the auto play gives you sufficient time to read the text and look at the scene, animated body language of waifus, facial expressions, and literally a dozen waifus in the game with chest bounce setting.  Nekogirls with bouncy boob setting.  NEKO GIRLS WITH BOUNCY BOOB SETTING.  story is good too.
Loli neko pls
catgirl ftw
My girlfriend saw me playing this. She stared for a bit, backtracked from the room, then came back with a shotgun. Now I'm dead.  Totaly worth it!
Played the demo and definitely worth getting the game, i am not a huge fan of visual novels, i find them to get boring really quickly with too much reading and too much non relevant content.   This one is fantastic, the music is well composed and changes in all the right places, the voices are too cute and just perfectly placed for each character. the storyline is more voiced with little extra descriptive text which is think is great. ui is clean and put together nicely. price is really cheap at $9.99 i would probably buy it even if it was a bit more. also the animations are great, they add so much life to the characters and keep you from dying of the boredom involved in clicking through static content of 2-4 lines of text.   Best visual novel type game i have played by far i would recommend it to anyone who likes these types of games and if you dont like them but your an anime fan who loves cute things then definitely do youself a favor and grab this, support the developers they really did a great job and they are not even charging that much for it.  Will definitely be getting the second volumn when its out, keep up the great work.  PRO's  Great Voice Acting Animated Characters Music Awesome Intro Quick and Clean UI  CON's *Updated  My only complaint was no trading cards, and seems they have now added trading cards so i dont have any cons for this game anymore.
It has mai waifu.
What can i say i love this game <3, if you like visual novels and anime related stuff you should try it!  I recommend this game :3  I rate 11/10
This is one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever played. I touched her shoulder and she came. 7.8/10 too much waterfalls in her pants
Very nice VN could of been longer but its great dat Boob Bouncieness Option xD 10/10 would play again :3 Neko Nya~   Kyouie~
If you enjoy disappointing your loved ones, then this is definetly a game for you...  8.9/10   :   "would speed-run again"
Catgirls, a slider to adjust booby bounciness, what else could a man want?  But seriously, a cute little game thats suprisingly fun.  #ilovevanilla
I would srsly recommend the +18 version if you are over 18 that is.  HUEHU-  *shot*
I Love to Disappoint my Parents Vol. 1  10/10 can't wait to disappoint them even more when Vol. 2 comes out.
I wish I were dead.
It has chest bounce config..  11/10
I didn't buy it at frist because I know the version on Steam is not full edition. Okay, I'm sorry that I got the game in an illegal way, but it's really good effort and made me feel sorry to play it for free.
please understand that this is gifted to me. Honest! I can prove it!  errr, guys? why are you looking at me like that? guys? don't leave me guys. GUYS?!!  sht, they all leave well, I get cat(girl)s here with me so it's not that bad, actually [i]maybe[/i] it's a good thing, I can have fun with the cat(girl)s
I got this game as a birthday present. Best 21st birthday ever! I have been playing this game every day since, and I feel much more adept in social situations already. For example, just the other day I worked up the courage to give the girl at the local ramen store (who I have been in love with since I was 16) a hug. The shy way she laughed and said "thank you" was more than I could have ever hoped for as far as my love life goes. I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone who wants to get the most out of life.  420/10
My cat approves o-o
This game changed my life, first i was a weeabo virgin now i fuck 17 neko baes on the day
You might be wondering, why would a cat want to have intercourse with a human? Well the answer is simple, it is much more pleasurable for cats to "ingest" the human member than a fellow male cat's. Felines, especially domestic cats, are well known for having penile spines. Upon withdrawal of a cat's penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.
one of the best clicker heroes training sims out there
It's quite repetitive and doesn't really provide the amount of ecchi/hentai I wished there to be. For me it doesn't deserve the "erotic"-tag. You also only get sexytime (you see nothing!) with 2 catgirls. The high-pitched japanese voices will also take their toll if you play longer than 30 minutes.  Only the slider that lets you adjust the bounciness of the boobs and the overall animation quality make it bearable to play this.  1/5 Boners.
nekopara is love, nekopara is life
Press P for Happiness
No shame. 2d love is real love.
Reasons to buy: Decent Slice of Life style story Great cast of Catgirls  Enough drama to make it interesting Incestual undertones (if that's your thing) Semi animated sprites (My first visual novel with moving characers, but I'm aware that it's the norm in Japan currently.) Options to have boobs bounce less or more (Why is this not an option in every game?) If you're a fan of 'Wanko to Kurasou' then this is for you  Reasons to not buy: Reading (This is a visual novel with no gameplay and no choices to make for different endings) Incestual undertones (If it's not your thing, but to be fair it's pretty light on the incest) Not for those sensitive to perverted things  My own thoughts on Nekopara: Being the slice of life anime and visual novel lover I am, I was very excited to see Nekopara show up on Steam. The story, while mostly cliche and predictable, was done well and left me excited to see if a volume 2 will come out. The moving characters don't move all that awkwardly like I have seen from other 2.5d games and it felt very much like I was watching an anime. Depending on reading speed and or what you set the auto-read settings to, you can finish this in 2-4 hours so keep that in mind if you are on the fence about buying this.   TL;DR: Slice of Life story done well - Lasts 4-5 hours max - Cliche but enjoyable
Since very few of the reviews for this are actually helpful, I figured I'd write one that was. Well-drawn artwork, nicely written and surprisingly touching dialogue, nice music, along with plenty of laughs, I'd highly recommend this to anyone.
The internet is for por..nyaa!  Grab your little master and double click ( or press F), For nyaa, nyaaa, nyaaaa!

So are they pussies or are they bitches?
There's a chest bounciness slider.  10/10
Boob physics. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT PEOPLE!??!?!
Great Visual Novel! Well, I'm already a big fan of the artist behind this game, so, playing this gave me a lot of fun. The characters are sooooo lovely and cute, the soundtrack was pretty good too.  Kawaii? 10/10 Desu? 10/10 Sexy? 10/10 Storyline? 10/10  Absolutely worth your money. ≧ω≦
From what I've played so far I can say this game is sucking me in, The graphics are amazing, I love how the characters move and talk. I also enjoy the humor in this game. I was in tears with how deep the story got in the beginning. I cant wait for more. This is definitely a game worth playing if you enjoy an emotional roller coaster and a good cry, as well as excellent graphics and wonderfully animated cat girls.
Moe  10/10  I strongly suggest you to get the +18 edition of DList as well. (If you're +18 that is)  You can just copy the files and you'll get the steam achievements while playing it.   I love this engine, they should make a lot more VNs with this, and quickly!  Also we need to fund Nekogirl project! I need to have Nekogirls in my lifetime!   I also wish Vanilla was as appealing as Chocola...
cat girls = best game  11/10
So.Damn.Cute!
This game is super cute <3 The art and music are beautiful <3 I usually dislike visual novels that don't give you choices, but this one is actually a good story without all that.
10/10 - These catgirls really do EVERYTHING for their master to be/feel happy.  Uhm... what I ment was... I SWEAR IT WAS A GIFT!!!
(This Player) now owns [b] NEKOPARA Vol. 1 [/b]   ... uh ... I can explain ...
If this isn't the pinnacle of gaming then i don't know what is.
( i got it myself,not a gift :3 ) It was a gr8 game with a great story. I found the game funny (i find alot of things funny). I cant wait for the 2nd one, and a game with chest boussnes is just...yes.
While I'd thought I'd be fapping to this.  I almost cried.  69/10
cat girls 10/10
Neko girl <3
It is adorable and has nekos. What else do you need?
Awesome VN. too bad there's no route for it, and some scene skipped :( the voice and animation are super great overal nice tho. 9/10
I used to be a dog person..
This was an amazing visual novel and only left me wanting more. Can't wait for volume 2!
Not must of a review because I am just writing my thoughts.  Despite the hoo ha about it being an eroge (erotic game) and the jiggle physic. I find Nekopora to be more than just a story of cute catgirls and fanservice.  The plot is simple yet refreshing with its occasionally funny moments that comes with a sense of tenderness. Chocola and Vanilla show us what happened if cats display human like beahviour and could speak (something I wouldn't want to happen in real life lol). The erotic bit are removed for the steam version so if you want to see the lewds, you'll have to find out how.   P.S: Do not put the bouciness to max, certain catgirl's chest became very disturbing when that option is on max
good game :^)
This is all I ever wanted.
Chest Bounciness Slider - best option ever made. 10/10 Bury approves. Gimme vol.2
In general, I like to quantify the amount of enjoyment I'm having. In the case of Nekopara, the metric I used to gauge my enjoyment is nyas per minute, or npm.   For reference, the famous "Nyan Cat" clocks in at an impressive 397 npm, +/- 2 nyas. While it is theoretically possible to exceed 400 nyas per minute, no human or computer has ever achieved such a feat. So for the purpose of this analysis, I will treat 400 npm as the soft cap for what is technically achievable by game developers.  Analysis:  In the minute long samples I took, the average was at 15 npm +/- 1 nya. During sex scenes, the npm dropped to around 10 npm. Npm peaked when three or more catgirls were on the screen, sometimes reaching as high as 31 npm. That Nekopara could have such a high nya density and still maintain coherent dialogue is an impressive feat to say the least.  Conclusion:   Given that the npm of Nekopara is only 1/26th the amount of npm in Nyan Cat, it only makes sense that the game itself is roughly 1/26th as popular as the internet viral video. This is not to say that I, as an individual, enjoy it 1/26th as much as the aforementioned video, just that given the statistical information above, the disparity in viewership is not unexpected.
Boob Bouncing Simulator
To start with, The visual novel (because it's hard to call this a game) is for people to whom the anime world is nothing new. It doesn't mean that you might not like it if you are alien with those, but it is rather recommended to know the anime/manga terms.  Personally I have played several visual novels (mostly where you have choice in it) and there was one major point that shines in this game, that is animation; yes this visual novel has mostly animated scenes and characters; also to add it consists japanese dubbing with chinese, english or japanese subtitles to choose, which I especially like. The story is very interesting and reminds me a first visual novel I had played, Wanko to Kurasou. The only things I do dislike is lack of choices as there is only one story in it. It is also short (4 hours for me), but it is just volume 1.  To sum up:  [h1][b]Pluses:[/b][/h1] [list] [*]Good art [*]Consists animations [*]Interesting story [*]Well made characters [*]Upcoming sequel [/list]  [h1][b]Minuses:[/b][/h1] [list] [*]Short [*]Version with +18 scenes not avaliable on steam (without modding) [*]Lack of choices [/list]  Sounds and voice acting: 9/10 Music: 7/10 Art: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Translation: 10/10 (For English version)  [b]Overall: 9/10[/b]
Look. There's Girls, Cats, and CatGirls. That much is evident. But you wanna know why you should get this game? Because of the sweet, sweet references. You know that NekoWorks got in store for you?! I'm talking King of Fighters and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure references, people! I'm 1800% sure you can't handle the hype, but.... Trust your Force anyway. And when you're ready, head for the Garden of NekoPara!      (As a side note, Chocola is okay and all, but we all know that the TRUE Best (Cat)Girls are Vanilla, Maple and Coconut. Everyone else is about C-Tier at best.)
It has a chest bounciness setting of course i recommend it
If you are looking for Female Neko that doesn't wear Clothes >< Don't play this game >< If you are looking for Female Neko that doesn't wear Clothes x0 Go outside,and see Female Stray Neko they doesn't put their clothes on... xD Congratulations!~ Now you're a H*ntai xP
Great Visual Novel! Although this was an impulss purchase on my part it was actualy alot beter then i anticipated from other visual novels i have seen. Once Vol.2 is out ill be sure to "impulssivley" buy it as well lol. XD

It was a gift
Well, I'm already a big fan of the artist behind this game, so, playing this gave me a lot of fun. The characters are sooooo lovely and cute, the soundtrack was pretty good too.  Absolutely worth your money. :)
Took me around 4 hours to play. But of all the visual novels on steam, this is by far the best one.
Alright,  Besides all the obvious content other reviewers refer to, Nekopara has many other great things going for it, besides the cute catgirls.  The backgrounds are awesome and just as beautiful as the characters. And about the characters, I've not read many VN's with that good drawing style. It's just awesome. Very detailed and very warm. Sound and music are spot on also. They fit right in and provide a very good atmosphere.  One thing though, that I don't like, is the fact that when you want to overwrite a save file or want to quit the VN; the mouse cursor moves to the "NO" button at first. I get the idea that it's funny the first tme.., but after 3, 4, 5 times...sorry. Well, that's just about the only thing that's not very good with this VN. I mean, everything else is perfect: Writing, art, cute characters and fun. Oh, about the hentai thing; this is on the green side, nothing you can't see on youtube.
Here it is how i am going to review my Japanese. Pressing P, E, J, and U, alternately. Such a nice fur nya nya 100/10
HHHNNNGGG...
Even if it's mostly for guys I will say I really enjoy it. The graphic is really what I look for in games and the CG's is just making it all better <3. The story wasn't boring and forgot all about time then I played it >w<. Ofcourse the chapthers could be a little longer but dons't matter x3.  Can't wait for the next game!!!
I bought the wrong game , I SWEAR !  .
Don't play this game while your parents and family member still in home. You won't regret it.[spoiler] CUTENESS level over 9000!! [/spoiler]
By the time I made this review, I've spend 8+ hours playing this, yet I haven't even unlock a single achievement.
the h-scene makes me awkward, i don't know why (download the r-18 patch and u'll know why)  10/10
*Geting dragged away by the Moral Police, Kicking and Screaming* - "I REGRET NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!" 10/10
Nekopara Vol. 1 is a game for the whole family to enjoy.  Make sure to get the Original Non-Steam Version and move it's files into the Steam Version for more "activites" for you and your family to enjoy!
Well, as all is said. This game was definitely a dream come true!
Despite it being funny and full of *cough* "Bounciness setting" it is still one of the more well drawn visual novels on Steam. If neko girls and VN's are your thing, get this.  10/10 Would punch the shit out of that neko vagina again  P.S  I played the "Steamy" version prior to owning the Steam version, but despite the H-Scenes being removed (which can be brought back) the Visual Novel is still sweet.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381425309
With NEKOPARA Vol. 1, I can now see God through Vanilla. Infinity/11 best game ok i love Cute Kitties show their Klitties Vol. 1
OH NO?! I'm fallin love with HUMANOIDS CATGIRLS!
Nekopara is an achievement in storytelling. Be it the steam version or the r18 version this story captures the heart of the player. You feel for all the characters. The art compliments the game even more then the story does. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great story.
This GAL......Nothing to say , GOOD (っ´ω`c)
I love this visual novel and the cat girls! it is the first time i have seen a visual novel in full motion like this and that is what got me into it. however, and i think it is because of Windows 8, it always freezes my computer up when trying to run it after you start the computer. I have to put it into sleep mode and then i hear the voices and it works afterwards.
Waifu 1~ Waifu 2~ Every catgrills is my waifu~ <3
I have not felt like a real man after playing this game.   5/5
P is my new favorite letter.
A total of 14 achievement, plot achievement of 10, you can unlock them by playing to end. Three language achievement, you can unlock them by trying three languages. Only a hidden achievement, point window, moving the mouse, just like making the chest XXX! Then the last one unlocked. In my opinion, the game is good, 9.5/10
We've got more than enough games, where people kill each other. We need more games, where people love each other instead.  If we could get those games without the absurd censoring, the world would be perfect. Yes, people. All of us are the product of sex, not of dismemberments or exploding heads.
This "game" enlightened me. From now on I will abandon my old life and devote it only to the catgirls.  #2DGirlsBestGirls  over 9000/10
i have no idea why i spent 10 dollars on this game, its basically clicking simulator 2k15...... best game 10/10 ign
DAT chest bounciness settings!! Best setting ever.
It's alright.
Please roommate don't hear this through my headset... please based god.
Wait.....What? I have no idea how this managed to find it's way into my Steam Library....I swear. Ugh who am i kidding...
It's an okay game so far, I think I'm going to need some more time with it for an accurate review...
I can now live out my dreams of having cat girls as pets who are also in heat.  10/10
I bought this under the influence of Tramadol, a morphine based painkiller.
This game is actually really enjoyable. Full voice acting, lip sync, and the characters move and feel real. Only problem is that Steam censored this and it isn't truly the full game. The full game is 18+ because of sexual content, so basically you're buying just a VN, not an eroge or anything that will get you off at night. But I must say I love this game so far and it really is worth the $$$ if you like anime and VN's. Overall, I give this game a 10/10 since I've played it countless times and it's animation/art style is very impressive for a VN. Must buy, don't let Chocola down.
11/10 Would give them catgirls 'milk' again.
[b]Buyer beware :[/b] Might causing your hand can't stop hitting "P" key.  Nekopara is a good VN. I admit, I bought this because of Sayori and Neko Works name on it, but I really enjoy this one until the end. While your usual galge still using sprite, this one using E-mote, so you can see more expressions (and bounciness) on the characters.  The good : • The comedy. I laughed more than I should. • E-Mote • The music • [strike]Chest Bounciness setting[/strike]  The decent : • The story. Some part of the story kinda weak. I'm not saying the whole story bad, it just some parts too similar with each others.  The bad : • [strike]No Maple's route[/strike] • Now I have to wait for Vol 2 :(  If you want a good laugh, or if you like nekomimi, or both of them, grab this one. The last event CG will give you a Nekomimi Paradise.
I thought the chest bounciness bar in the settings was down right revolutionary but to make things even better, it turns out that the P button will make them.....  BOUNCE AUTOMATICALLY!  LIKE, AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT!  sweet baby jesus what a time to be alive  Edit 1: I forgot what life is like outside, im sure the sun misses me but nobody can save me from the glory that is jiggle physics.

i got the game for my friend so it would seem weird if i bought it myself ..... it was worth it, the story is actually kinda adroable... then you F***k them and it gets raunchy 69/69
Mmmmmmmmmm!
You've got 2 cute cat girls. What more could you want!?  Okay, maybe a Volume 2.
Cute, simple and well polished Visual Novel. Great artwork from Sayori, awesome voice acting and cool animations. The downside is that it's really short and the character development goes way too fast. The story feels kinda rushed. That been said, yes, if you like catgirls or Sayori's previous works you are gonna totally enjoy this.  For the love of god, patch in the R+18 after you buy it. A lot of character development goes thought the H scenes. Also, these scenes take up to 25% of your game time.
Its a weird game. It even has a control slider for boobs .-.
10/10.  Also waiting for them to release an uncensored/uncut dlc.
WARNING! to all the new people going to buy this game, remember that this is the steam version of the game and all the NSFW material has been censored or completely removed.   The games community helps you with playing the R-18 version through steam but that requires you to have the different copy, ether the digital download or the physical one.  P.S. I bought the game because I'd thought there'd be sexual and explicit material but this version in the SFW version.
At first I was skeptical with it being a cat girl game... but after the first 10 minutes I was hooked. I didn't know whether it was Chocola's personality or the ability to hit P for extra bounce, but whatever it was... I couldn't stay away. "Coconut girl, breast girl" -Mark Lewis 2015.
Oh my.. this Visual Novel is really quite enjoyable.. Adorably so I'd say. However it is that. A Visual Novel, the extend of input required is that to continue the dialogue.. no choices to be found.  I would still highly recommend this to anyone who is down to the idea to read stuff about adorable kitten girls and have some visual aids.  The little animations that were put on the character made the whole experience even better in my opinion :3  so have fun with this, I know I had.
You can sex catgirls  10/10
10/10 Best game ever!
I want moarrrr
My friend gifted me this. On my birthday. I'm not even joking.  I told him about this Japanese game called Nekopara which is the game that made hentai internationally famous on Steam, and as soon as I told him about the game, he gifted me this.   His letter said,  "Mr. Hentai, here is the cyber girlfriend that you always wanted"  Mr. Hentai-_-..................................  So anyway, I beat the game (More like I only kept pressing the space button since all I wanted to see was hentai), and well, the game is good.   Here are some of the things that make this game good:   1. Fluent hentai animation (Now, this can be seen only if you have the hentai version of the game). Now, what makes a good hentai game, a good hentai game? It is those good animations. There are many of them that only have just the pictures, but this one is the real deal. The animation is so natural, my Steam FPS counter says I am running it on 59~60 FPS on average.  2. Story. Well, uh, I don't know about the story because all I was interested in was hentai   I actually like how this game has 3 languages, Japanese, English and Chinese. Now you can tell hentai games are slowly taking over Steam.   I am expecting more from this maker.   Verdict: 69 out of Oppai   This game deserves those awards:   - OoTY (Oppai of the Year) - HoTY (Hentai of the Year) - PoTY (Pantsu of the Year) - WoTY (Waifu of the Year)   Cheers, my fellow hentai brothers.
this game is really relaxing; however, there is no nudity i am very diapointed in steam! now i have to ether buy the 18++ ver. or find a crak. this is the soul reason i hate cencership!   if you dont want a craked ver. and want 18++ with nudity get the game here: http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE144678
I think i just came... ohwell  10/10 would came again.
I lost my pants. 10/10
I came for the catgirls and I came to the catgirls. 10/10
(Maids + Cats + 'plot')  Good game 10/10
Even with the censorship from our Steam overlords I have to say I fully enjoyed this game thus far. I'm close to the ending and I'm eager for furhter releases by the developer. The story is nice and fuzzy, it tugs at my heart strings, the animation and voice acting is superb, and I just overall love the game ~<3  It's great to enjoy the visual novel's lovely pacing and I don't mind not having choices and just sitting back to enjoy the tale of love between a protagonist and catgirls. It's a lovely experience for anyone to have.  Plus, maids. Cat girl maids. My life. Complete it has become. I can rest in peaces. =w=
my brother walked in on me during the bath scene and hes never looked so disappointed in me. he hasnt talked to me since.
Cuteness overload ♥
This game has a chest bounciness setting.  What a time to be alive.
This game pleased me...          literally.       10/10 Would Be Pleased Again.
I SWEAR IT'S GIFT FROM MY FRIEND!
If you have any regrets when you bought this game you did something wrong. A real neko lover never looks back! NOW GO GIVE YOUR MONEY TO GABEN AND GET KAWAII NEKOS ITS A 2 FOR 1 DEAL   10/10 would buy volume 2
Amazing game... I love Visual Novels and nekopara is now my top 5 favorite VN :D I notice there was a small glitch with deleting saved game (game would crash everytime you try to delete saved file) but that dosen't affect the game play. I am also planning to order the physical copy of the game so I can add to my collection :)  I'll give 10/10 <3  Ps: I hope to play Vol. 2 :D  EDIT: Patched the game to have +18 scene and it was ok.... I felt like this game is better without the sex and other lewd stuff
got 4 achievements in the first minute of launching it for the first time.  10/10  also there's an achievement called bounce bounce, got it on accident when typing to a friend  11/10  was actually a fun story...  steam version is censored. don't look on this game's community if you can't handle the uncensoredness.....
Today is my birthday and I skipped my family dinner to spend time with Chocola because she's the only one that really understands me. Great game, 11/10 would reccomend, If Chocola isn't the girl for you, you always have Vanilla.        On that note,   It actually is my birthday,    I have no idea what i'm doing with my life.    Help me.
I had fun with this game (yes the censored one :D )   So i don't regret buying it at full price...   Also... Chest bounciness/10
A short visual novel (5 Hours of reading) about some owner of a bakery who realized that he has some catgirl fetish. The story feel a little bit short and to be honest not really that good (it's just your generic fanservice filled VN "ooh ooh nii-sama marry me" and all that kind of thing). I can't really judge the art and the music tho, for me it's good. I have seen several bad VNs and if i have to score this VN i'd give it 8/10 for the art and the music.  The score of this game in overall? I'd give it 7,5/10   But i'd play it again sometimes just for the lulz and to see my catgirl harem again.
Nekopara changed my life  PS  P=Pounce
Though R-18 version is the way to go (if you're legal to see it), the all ages version wasnt actually that bad.  But just to make things clear, this is a real Visual Novel, not a game. no choices, no nothing. just like reading a por~... ehem, book.  Why I think it's good? Well, "A cat is fine, too."
What the butts in that shame thing you're talking about? Nah, I don't know anything about that. I'm just here for the catgirls.  Vanilla mai waifu
you want moe? BUY THIS FUCKING GAME!! but i told you , this game no hentai, WANT HENTAI? BUY THE GAME AT THE WEBSITE!! COZ THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU WANT FAP FAP SO BADLY!!!
I bought this game for the plot.  18+/10 would rate again.
The CTRL button is your best friend if you play it for achievements.
Quite literally the best game ever. Game of the year, possibly game of the decade (the sequel might contest it.)
I GOT IT FOR THE INTERESTING STORY
Bought this out of curiosity. It was a new game, it seemed well drawn and designed, it had catgirls. A good combination for me. And oh, boy. Did NEKOPARA deliver. One of the cutest things I've ever played, with wonderful animations and professional voice acting.  That said, the main character is veeeeery bland, and the plot isn't that well paced or interesting... But I will probably buy Vol.2 when it comes out. Cinnamon is just too adorable for me to miss out on more of her.
If you love cats and girls you're at the right place. It's a funny game with nice animations, but it's a bit short though.  All in all i recommend this game to all Neko Lovers.  9/10 Would pat Catgirls again.
Warning this is not a game. It's a visual novel about a guy who moved away to make his own bakery but then his sister's Cat girls packed themself into crates and refuses to move out of his place. So they begin working and boy are they ignorant peice of shit that only care that their ''master'' pets them.  Sure you can change the slider on their breast and if you mod the game you can turn this into a 18+ game. They've even greenlighted a 18+ version of this game.   Not to mention ''Nekopara'' means ''Cat paradise'' so if this is your kink and you enjoy visual novals about master and their cat-like-girls then go a head. I bet you will love this trash.
Nekopara, in which a Japanese society at an uncertain period in the future horrifically alters human embryos to have lower intellect and animal parts, in order for them to be used as pets and masturbatory tools for sexual deviants.  Inhumane experiments, human trafficking, sexual slavery, and bestiality all together at last.  Thanks, Japan.﻿ 10/10
I love the story of this game. I loved the characters themselves, made me feel the emotions of each situation; From laughing to wake up my roommate to about to cry when a special moment came. The music was great to the feel of each situation i advise people to buy the game or at least give it a chance by trying the demo.
What can I say about Nekopara?....   I LOVED IT  I enjoyed the plot (even though it was a bit sappy) and I loved the characters. Plus there's jiggle physics for a good laugh.  Buy it if you love visual novels and catgirls  Neko/10 IGN
Nekopara is a good happy VN that's really quick. Don't really think it's woth $10 though. You should probably wait for a sale  to buy this. Really enjoyable though.
Nekopara is one of the best games i've ever played (in text games i mean), if u like text games, and cuteness everywhere, you MUST BUY, not only bcause that things that i said, but bcause the char moves, voice acting, cute chars. The only thing that is missing, is the +18 Version ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) this game isn't complete without it
best way to lose your social life! who needs that anyway - 10/10
Best visual novel i have read so far, can't wait for vol. 2 harem fun <3  10/10
Very cute! Viewer discretion: Heart attacks may ensue from cuteness.
i've disappointed my ancestors
the cursor became invisible what do i do
I don't have pet cats at home. For $10 I can have not just 1, but 2 pet kittehs! Bonus cause i can fuck them :3
แน่นอนครัช มาซะขนาดนี้ ให้กับความน่ารักอย่างเดียวพอ  1000/10   แน่ นอน ซื้อมาเล่นกัน
there is no escape from this nekohell
14/6.8 -Do you like cutsy little catgirls? -Do you wanna sex them? -Buy this now then -more chapters on their way -Only upset you dont do the sex on Coconut  But really get the 18+ otherwise it worthless Gets very sad, have some tissues handy
20/10 would definitely wrek again!!! don't worry catgirls I'm coming back!!!!
Fun and entertaining plus neko <3
Lovely drawing style, a heartbreaking storyline which is perfektly told!  Infinite/10 + plot  Would play it again.
20/11 Doritos given, +Catgirls in boxes, +Noosebleed mode when "P" is spammed, +Can be combined with the 18+ version and have the achievements still working, +Feels so alive, due to the animations the catgirls have, +Control boob bounce with a few clicks  -wallet is getting more space the more NEKOWORKS is being epic, -Six hours of gameplay is NOT ENOUGH, need moar.  NekoWorks keep up the good work, you guys are the gods of Noosebleeds. 15/10 would create another account to buy it again.
For $10 this is a great Visual Noval very cute very touching and a good amount of interesting characters
it always makes me sad when things like these eventually come to an end ;-; wheres Vol.2??? haha i love this game!
Pretty short Visual Novel I would say. I would play the adult version as well. (◕‿◕✿)﻿ 10/10 Now I have a catfetish brb.
Best $10 you could ever spend to be having a purely platonic and sensible relationship with your cats. You know.... "like daughters.... like lovers..."
Seriously science you really need to get on the catgirl level asap!!!!
Wish I had downloaded the demo first or read up about the game before buying! Thought it was a game like Recettear. I did play for about an hour and a half, so I could at least offer up a somewhat informed review for those of you thinking about buying. Which is worth the 10 bucks to me! I probably got closer to two and a half hours through the story though, b/c I clicked through the dialogue pretty darn fast.  I'm not a fan of full-on visual novels where you don't get to make any choices ... but for those of you who enjoy the genre, this is exactly what you're looking for. AAA+ quality "game" as far as art, animation, story and the characters themselves. You'll & truly really fall in love with your cat-girls and even the narrator (you!) is a likable dude, so no one should have trouble relating. Also, they're not kidding with the "mature" and "nudity" user-tags, haha. Tastefully done, still, if you don't find yourself getting a bit, uh, excited, playing this game, well ... you're just not human!  10/10. I have yet to give out a perfect score on any game I've reviewed, but this is truly a flawless piece of art. I personally did not encounter any bugs, glitches, or even spelling/grammatical errors, so I will stick to my perfect score until finding otherwise.
Well, that was ace. Totally worth buying twice :D
help. plz. this game. will change you.
what am i doing with my life
After the long search for animu. This made my search complete. :3
I think I got called "pervert" more in this game than my real life, and I'm kind of a screwed up person in real life as well 0/10
I am disappointed in the fact that this is just a visual novel with storyline but no interaction from players. You have no choice to stories' outcomes and its just short novel with cute characters and japanese voice. I like the characters and story without doubt, but if you can grow some of stats of characters or choose outcomes of this game from players' choices - it will be awesome "game" I expect. As for now, this is just a novel, not "game" I expect.
fapfapfap. Got lub check, Got tissues check, Got a week off from works doctors note check. Recommend the game. But I highly recommended the adult game  OH AND FYI PRESS P U PERVERT hahaahahahahahah you like  10/10
This made my hotpocket sizzle       100000/100000
Well Shit ,  Their where cat girls in it . . .
I broke up with my girlfriend, and quit my job as soon as I got this game.  Now I can devote my entire wellbeing to kawaii nekos.  No Regrets 2015 <3
Where are my pants.
> I was only an Otaku > I loved Chocola and Vanilla so much, I had all their Doujins and Figurines > I pray to Chocola and Vanilla every night before bed, thanking them for the life I've been given > "Nekopara is love" I say. "Nekopara is life" > Everyone hears me and they called me a weeb > I knew they were just jelous of my devotion to Chocola and Vanilla > I called everyone a trollfag > They slaps me and sends me to go to sleep > I'm crying now, and my kawaii face hurts > I lay in anime bed and it's totally really cold > A warmth is moving towards me > I feel something fluffy touch me > It's Chocola and Vanilla > I am so happy > They whispers in to ear "This is my fluffy tail" > They grabbed me with their powerful fluffy paws and puts me on my hands and knees > I'm ready > I spread my steam wallet for Chocola and Vanilla > They penetrated my wallet > It hurts so much but I do it for Chocola and Vanilla > I can feel my wallet emptying as my eyes start to water > I push against their force > I want to please Chocola and Vanilla > They Nyaan a might Nyaa as they filled my wallet with their kawaii-ness > Everyone walks in > Chocola and Vanilla looks at them straight in the eye and says. "It's all neko now" > Chocola and Vanilla leaves through my Computer > Nekopara is love, Nekopara is life  Jokes aside, This game is a must have for people who adore cute stuffs like cats and a tiny bits of romance. The voice acting is great as it has really an impact to the emotion, The animation is really cutting edge amazing and every time they move just makes me happy. Every character is likeable especially Chocola. Story is great due to it's warm heart comedy atmosphere. The OST's fits every scene as well.  [Recommended seal here] <3  I'm excited for the release of Nekopara Vol.2 on December 2015, Can't wait :3
It's catgirls. The only thing that could make it better would be more catgirls. 11/10
This game is: 10% actual story 90% kawaii catgirls with big breasts.  There isn't any actual scenes in the game that could qualify as 'hentai', but some scenes are definitely ecchi, so don't get your hopes up too much.  Oh also the voice acting is really great.
It's like skyrim, but with more shame 10/10
This game is so vanilla it will give you diabetes and heart problems.  To those weak at heart I won't recommend this game. Someone already posted how to put the R18 version to steam, but it's all up to you if you want to play the all-ages version or the R18 version [u]you sick bastard[/u].   Eitherway it's a gr8 game wud play it all over again, can't wait for Vol2 for more happy light-hearted story that will make me crie everytiem because it doesn't happen in my real life. I'm hoping it won't be a linear story on the next release.  It's a 10/10 Game you should spend your shekels with. [u] You'll never have a catgirl that will love you unconditionally ;_; [/u]
What am I doing with my life?
This game....gave me nosebleed way to much...
No regrets.
Catgirls.  9/11 Would buy Adult version.
Recommend ! A must have game !
nyan nyan nyan... nyan nyan...  This game is just a odd but amazingly fun visuwal noval to read.  10/10 would play agen... nyan...
This game is absolutely a must have in your steam library. It's all kinds of moe, tsundere and neko, so pretty much everything I love :P there are 6 catgirls in which you will meet but you will bond the most with two in particular, those two being Chocola and Vanilla. They are both different but also similar being that they are twins. This was pretty much everything I hoped for, however, I did feel slightly disappointed that I couldn't choose an action. If you leave it on autoplay its like watching a short anime show but overall I was pleasantly surprised and smiled a lot. Make sure you click the key, "P" to unlock the last achievement :)
So kawaii, so innocent yet ... KAWAII!  10/10
I bought it for the plot, I swear!
I'm sure this game wasn't made for any other purpose than to masturbate to.
Kawaii Nyaa~~~~
Catgirl Paradise, just as the name describes.  +very nice characters +good voice acting +good story(though no choices) -music starts to get a little repetitive after a while  Also game crashed on trying to delete a save, ended up not having a save of last progress. But game remembered where I was, ctrl skips to furthest point. :)
Chocola & Vanilla >///< Kawai -Desu   i hope have the new chapter~
Short, cute, silly and lovely. For its price, you can't go wrong. Expecting the next volume!
Got Cats, Got Girls, Got Cat Girls, Best Game 10/10 Would date Cat Girls again
Makes me question my own standards and how i see cats. Lolicats. 10/10
This is probably one of the most kawaii things I've seen. Period. Those kitties with the voice sync, high quality graphics and audio make this an outstanding visual novel, with vast detail, good effects, and punches more then what people would expect to see within the design and engineering of a visual novel style game. I've played so many VNs I've lost count over the years, but by far this one takes the cake for the most magnificent, moe, CG I've seen so far to be within a visual novel.  Definitely recommend this! Just take note this version [b]does not have any R-18 content unless you install a patch seperately.[/b]
neko neko !!!!!! miao~ miao~ miao~
This game is Kawaii   Must buy
Patched the game with the 18+ version. Got so much cat booty I almost died.  10/10
You can tell a lot about a person by what is in their steam library. This game should throw some flags immediately, just saying.  Despite this, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is the perfect game for those looking to abandon all interpersonal relationshipts in exchange for cat-girl lust and a 2D lifestyle.
If i wanted neko hentai i would watch neko hentai. don't waste money on a 17 and under Visual Novel cause i know anyone who buys this is just looking for neko sex scenes and theirs many more with actual nudity and sex scenes.
I was attracted by the title when I saw steam releasing a new Comic Market release, after I investigated a little bit and decide to buy it full price - I'm the kind of person usually wait for titles to pick up until it went on sale, but the "good" reviews and my curoisity overwhelmed by patience on the title. I "beat the game" in 6 hours and I feel for 10 dollars, this is not bad for a visual novel.  Pros:  High animation quality (In terms of Visual Novel) - The main game is basically reading a novel, but with slideshows involved. I have "played" some visual novels in the past, but this time I'm pleasently surprised due to the movement of the characters are actually pretty good (except for some death stares when they forgot (I think?) to animate the eyes). The characters move pretty realistically (again, in visual novel standards), and the legendary "P" key enchance the gameplay for approximately 200%.  Good voice acting - This is mostly personal preference, but I do like the voice acting in the game. It's anime-y and it gives you the vibes of watching a shounen "full of service" anime. Also I highly appreciate the publisher keeping the original voice cast instead of going for the localization of games (I'm looking at you, Dynasty Warriors).  Cons:  NOT a dating sim - I don't know what steam's definition of "Dating Sim" is (Or better yet, who put dating sim in the tag in the first place), but a dating sim in my book involves choices - choices that you choose determines which girl you are pursuing, but this game has no choices at all, basically it's the "Left click and you beat the game" game. I have no problem Nekopara has no choices whatsoever, but please steam, don't mislead people into thinking they are playing a game which they have choices.  Cutting content - I know that steam is trying to fend off the "made for erotic sensation" games in steam, but cutting content still stinks no matter what the reason is. For those who are not aware: The game is originally R-18, but steam decides to only include the non R-18 content (The original have the settings to enable/disable it). It does not affact the story much (Only 3 scenes are invloved), and there are fixes that enable the content (Check out the only guide in this game for details), but I feel like it's like playing witcher 2 without the sex - It's okay, but it feels weird.  Small typo on subtitles - I did not check the japanese subtitles (as I do not know japanese well enough), but the chinese and english subtitles have small typos and paste errors. It does not affact the game much, and the rest of the translation is top-notch... but just a minor con in my opinion.  In general I recommend this game if you like Visual Novels and the "sweet-sweet" type story, and I'm looking forward to Sekai Project's next game to publish, cause I feel they have enough passion to gather such a new VN to steam, I feel and hope they will publish more high quality VNs here.
I used to be a dog person ...
This game is full of happy moments with a very cute characters and beautiful music. *^*
Played the 18+ version 100/10 would fap again :D  but for real now this is a very good visual novel,  it made me laugh, it get me to tears, it entertained me very well and the story was good nothing special but good.  Would recomment to anyone who likes anime, cuteness and fun :D
I'd have to give this game a 8.5-9 out of 10. It's pretty good and cute. Just wish you had options during the game. Other than that it's not that bad. Pick it up if you like VN.
I will join in the ranks of those who love this visual novel and say that it is overwhelmingly, positively, super cute! Chocola and Vanilla are awesome, and Shigure is basically the ultimate imouto! If you like cute things at all, you will not regret buying this and if you want the 18+ version, there are meathods to add those scenes into your steam version. Guides are available for that.   Thank you NEKOWORKs and Sekai Project! I look forward to the next release of ultimate cuteness from Chocola, Vanilla and Shigure!
If you are going to "play" this, you might as well get the 18+ version to get the most out of it.   1. Buy this game one Steam. 2. Install the game. 3. Get the 18+ version. 4. Install it in the same directory, overwrite any existing files. 5. In Steam client, right click on Nekopara Vol. 1-> Properties-> Set Launcher Options->Add: -steam="yes" 6. Play the game the way it meant to be. All the Steam features including Achievements will work.  Brace yourselves when you get to chapter 5.
Gimme dat kitty, the physics engine is stronk with this one, 10/10 would bounce again.
10/10 would buy again
help
The most moe game on Steam to date.  10/10 moelicious.

Warning: This game will steal your virginity away, slowly.
Oh god I love this game.  If your able the download the "Hentai" Extension its even better.
This game is a really fun read and worth the money. A few scenes have been cut but it is still just enjoyable and the music throughout the game is splendid and if you like catgirls....This game was amde for you. 9.5 out of ten this is a great visual novel that everybody could enjoy
Bought all the damn versions of this thing.  10/10 would buy again.

thanks for this game i am a cat person now
*sigh*  The shit I put up with. *unzips pants*
Just like Master said after playing with catgirls: I have no regrets.
Nekopara is so cute, compared to most visual novels I've played the art is top notch! The boob physics are hilarious and also a plus.  11/10, pouring all of NASA's funding into cat girl humanoids.
Best use of the "P" letter ever.
My friend told me this game unlocks TF2 hats how do I get them?  16/10 I hate this game
11/10 for chest bounciness meter  P.S. I didn't buy this game, it was a gift i swear!
I have to play this game while my parents are asleep so they don't tear up over the really good story
.
0/10 NO BOOBIES OR TENTACLE RAPE!!
Literal Pornography on steam. Must get game. Got me banned from twitch. 10/10.
[h1]10/10[/h1]  If you weren't interested by the name and the picture, it's probably not for you. That said, truly a 10/10 masterpiece.
CHest BOunciness intenses
I can't play Nekopara without stopping for a breather every few minutes because of cardiac arrest inducing cuteness. 16.5/10 will leave out social responsibilities for a week.
The chest bounciness slider puts this game second only to the beta of Phantasy Star Online 2.  Boobs/10
I played for what seemed like 5 minutes, then realise my mum was behind me. i cant look her in the eyes now. chocolas chest/10
So, after the long wait i got this game (Missed out on the LE which is killing me), going to give the game in some simple points  +Catgirls +Gorgeous art of Saori +Emofuri style animation done perfectly +Good Comedy  -Incredibly Short, even with the 18+ Content added in, though it's only £7 so it's not too bad -Story is Subpar, usual things -Characters are the usual, with a Cat part added in -Writing isn't too great  That's all you need to know really, if you're gonna read this it's going to be for the art, animations and Nekomimi and i'm reccommending this because i FUCKING LOVE Kemonomimi
[h1]Pros:[/h1][list]     [*]Animated kawaii nekos     [*]Chest Bounciness slider     [*]Press P to enter God Mode  [/list]  [h1]Cons:[/h1][list]     [*]Can't touch those nekos [/list]  Believe me, this game is a life changer! 10/10 would get diabetes again
Yo dawg, I totally PARA'd those NEKOs if ya know what I mean  10/10  World needs more games like this.  What's Vol.2 and 3 going to be like?  Nekopara 2, the Desolation of Smaug  Nekopara 3, The Five Armies  Nekopara 4, Like, Totally all the Nekos at once man, ya feel me dawg  Nekopara 5, Retribution
NO REGRETS! 10/10!!
本当に良いゲーム
oh dear where did my other hand go 34/10
Okay.. Now you can judge me... The game is surprisingly well written and funny, and has a pretty weirdly cool overworld fleshed out about the whole catgirl thing...85/100
Feckkin Amazurn!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!111
Didn't notice the difference of putting the chest bounciness feature to the max until cinnamon and coconut appeared. Shigure apparently has a mini dimension in her clothes, full of tuna. Coconut's coconuts. Apparently having a sexual relationship with your pets is socially accepted. Not a single woman thinks its weird that I'm 'doing the deed' with my cats. Vanilla is best girl. 10000/10
Just press p 10/10
First there is one catgrill Then there is two catgrill Then lots of cat grill Then mod in R18 content Then you have very good time with kawaii catgrills Steam is #1 platform for cute catgrills
This game CHANGED MY LIFE. After my wife left me there was a hole in my heart I didn't think I could ever fill again. I was no longer able to find joy in games, so when I first started up this game I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story.  I was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well. What can I say, I guess I'm just too much of a hunk! Keep playing and you might get as good as me.  The animation really makes them seem alive. I keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them. The art is not only very cute, but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters. It's even better than talking to humans. Before this game I had no one. Now I have not one, but TWO cat wives who love me! Who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally?  Even better is the immersive programming. The characters always seem to follow my eyes, and whisper my name at night. I can't figure out how you guys programmed that! Great job though.  The game is so good that I'm never going to stop playing. I'm finally happy again. THANK YOU NEKO WORKS!!!
[u]My thoughts:[/u] Cats meow meow cats cats cats meow! Meow the cats and cats meow! The cats were meow and the meow were cats! I am meowicus the meow and this is catucus the cat! There were many kitty cats and many meowy meows! If you meow all the cats, you will have cat desires  and you will have catpanions for the rest of your life! We must meow to become cats and change the future of the cat paradise!   [u]The things i liked:[/u] the kitty cats were cute and they meow day to day! the meowy food were meowious and now i'm stuffed with cats! :/ I heard all the cutie meows and my ears were filled with beauty cats meow!   [u]My expectations of the next Neko Para game:[/u] I hope the cats will travel forth to the middle meow and eat plenty of fish!!
[h1]NekoPara is the greatest thing to ever grace this earth.[/h1]  The [b]quintessential[/b] game about cats in heat. 11/10, would enter polygamous, interspecies relationship again.
IT WASNT A GIFT I SWEAR!!!
I tried the demo and realized that Nekopara was too cute to not buy so I ended up purchasing it and haven't regretted it. I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the game, and still enjoy it afterwards. It is a nice, innocent, and entertaining story to experience. I also got pretty attached to the characters. I give it a 10/10. However I think I may have been playing this game wrong, because there is an uncensored hentai version with more scenes, sooo... yeeaaahhhh...
I wont recommend this to you...If I do..you'll stole all of my waifu XD  jk
Absolutely Incredible
great graphic, cat ear, japaness anime... ok shut up and buy it.
CATS GIRLS BOUNCING SET JIGGLE PHYSICS TO MAX AND WATCH DEM KITTIES FLY
Great for... everyone.
Swapped the files over for the unsencored version and achievements still worked, 'played' through all its content, if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  10/10
The kind of game that I put on my batman costume to use in front of my neighbors sprinklers at 3:32am every third Tuesday of the month.  10/10  P.S. I'm Batman!!!
This is not a Chinese Cartoon Porn Game, I swear....
Vanilla best girl ever! No +18 Scenes, but totally worth be money! Why we don't fund the research of nekogirls already?
You will never be happy like the man in this VN with his catgirl harem. This is review is here to remind you that it will never happen, never ever.  I like catgirls so I give it ok/10
"What is this?" "Mom, It was a gift!" "Sure it is. And explain why your on chapter 6?" "I left it on when i went to the store!" "And why is chest bounciness on max?" "Uhh... "(Thinks of reason) "It's okay, I understand. Your going through that phase..." (Mom continues talking) (Orders Manga on Amazon while shes talking) "Yep. Kk."  11/10, would play again.
I think everyone who played this novel can agree with me.  We need more Catgirls in Video Games.  Sekai Project, you guys never disappoint!
I have a major catgirl fetish  I'm sorry
Vol 2 please
An excellent and flawlessly gorgeous visual novel by one of hentai's most elegant artists, Sayori. I have been following her artwork for years and could not contain myself when I saw this. Look for more NEKO WORKs manga online.  The voicing is superb, and storyline is just good enough to be interesting, but let's not pretend that we're not all here for the catgirl threesome porn. ...Which is goddamn explosively sexy, by the way. Look on the internet to find how to get your Steam-y version.  P.S. This game has a boob jiggle slider. So there.
So kawaii ,,,^-^,,, Neko <3  Chest bounciness slider added into the options menu? Yeah... this game gets a 10/10 right there. xD  In all honesty though, one of the best animated VNs of all time. The amount of work they put into this is just amazing. Character details and animations are brilliantly done for a VN. They even incorporated the game window into the game, moving the game in windowed mode moves the characters in the game.  Slightly a short VN in comparison to others, story is well done but not the best, personally I believe the story could of been better. There is only one path in the game, but it doesn't effect the game's entertainment at all. When Vol 2 is made and released, I'm sure they'll incorporate more paths and possibly and even larger story.  I will give this VN a 10/10 though, even though the story was slightly lacking, the VN's entertainment was top notch, and the animation is out of the world. Not to mention, it starts the story of a series and opens up for Vol 2.
12 nekos out of 10 nekos ;3
Cooool Cutes characters and a good stories, but it's just a little boring because we can't do anything
So erm Nekopara.... Right off with the review!  So Nekopara is a visual novel or eroge if you want to call it. Now what's a visual novel? Technically visual novel is like a movie, voice pack, picture book, and usually visual novel are rate 18+ but with steam you have the all age version.  (To get the R 18 Go here -> http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE144678.html)  Now Nekopara you play as a guy, Minaduki Kashou. You just open a small bakery in a small town and just as you were moving and clearing your item. you encounter two box which seems oddly out of place.... Meet the two main heroine. Chocola and Vanilla two cute cat girl! Here your adventure start with your two lovely cute cat girl.  Pros:  This is the 1st few Visual novel i played that have animated moving character sprite and it does help you get more into the game then most visual novel does. +Great animation   The game also provide good voice acting, cute infact!  ( granted i don't play japan game with English voice so i wouldn't know how the English voice acting sound like...) +Good voice acting  The character are likeable (just about it) +Likeable character  The Meh part:  The game length is reasonable. i clock in at about 6 hour or so. -/+ depends on how you view it. to me it felt right, any longer will feel like a drag.   Cons:  Ok so in visual novel usually there are choices, which decide which heroine you want to romance with. But this feature doesn't seem to be anywhere in this game... so it took me out of bit and actually. Replay vaule in visual novel are important, by introducing so many character and off no different at all is sad and make  me wish for more. Only reason to actually play this again is maybe in a few weeks or months time. -No choice -No replay vaule.  Conclusion: Do i think you should buy it? Well honestly.... Yes!  If you are a fan of visual novel with tons and tons of cats/Neko then give this a shot. If you are a fan of muti ending, and want different route to play with then.... sadly you wont find any here. But i say buy this to show support!  Support this title so next time we might see more visual novel on steam!  Rating 8/10
its nice visual novel with catgirls
Nekopara is love, Nekopara is life.
Please, just make this stop.
nice meme
4/10 No backstory; is this a different world? Is it a different timeline? If it's earth did the cats mutate? Are they aliens? How did they first meet humans, etc. The overall story isn't particularly engaging.  Quite predictable as well. I didn't feel like I could relate or empathize with the main character at all. In terms of being a vn: visual novels are meant to give the player a sense of control in how they affect the storyline. The fact that the player cannot influence any of the  protagonists decisions in the VN is a fairly big deal and severely affects replayability. The game is based around the premise of "cats that are humanoid" however they don't act like cats. Cats in general I have found to be standoffish and much more self absorbed then they are portrayed in this VN and this causes the feline character to seem much more doglike. The art is amazing however, and the visual effects are quite fluid (transitions, the boob jiggle, expression changes etc.) Music was quite standard with other visual novels. Not bad but not outstanding.  In summary, subpar as a game, subpar as a visual novel but it has nice art and decent music for its genre. Not worth $10 however if you're curious pick it up if it's less then $3.   P.S If you are interested in light novels after this game, and have never read Katawa Shoujo... Go give it a go, I promise you won't be disappointed.
A nice game that teach you how to deal with your catgirl at home when they are in heat. :3 Hmm, lets hope that all cat didn't think they need to mate with their owner when they are in heat, or things.. will.. get strange.. Please do not do that with your real cat at your home. Please..
I was starving for 3 days for this game.  Would starve again for the 2nd Volume.
Held Spacebar till the end   11/10 would speedrun again
FIrst time having a Visual novel. A good one at that. For ten bucks I expected the game to end a couple times short but it turns out that this story is actually a pretty long one! or even a really long one. It's a good way to pass the time from video games and is certainly more entertaing then reading an actual Manga or Book (Light Novels they're called? Of there are any). Thought I'd give VN's a try because I've heard a lot about them and I'm glad i chose this one as a first to read.
What can I say?
What to say about this....  It's cute, it's adorable and it's quite charming. THAT IS UNTIL YOU PLAY THE +18 SIDE AND REGRET YOUR LIFE CHOICES!.  Outside that, would recommend :)
it has catgirls
...I...I can explain...
much feel, such emotion, wow neko <3
My good friend Greg bought me this for my birthday. He's no longer my friend.
404/10. Smelly cats not found. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNXIZuIBJKs
Now I have a female friend!
BEST GAME EVARRR
From the famous Ero-manga~  4 years I've been waiting for Chocola & Vanilla  totally worth to buy XD
Quick review after 2.7 hours of play time:   - Sound: 1000/10. Absolutely amazing.  - Character development: 1000/10. It's going beyond real characters. They are more alive than humans are. Compared to the characters, we are zombies.  - Effects: 10/10. Amazing, nothing else to say about it.  - UI: 9/10. Not the best i have ever seen, but it's really well done and really clean. Enough customizations and silders. Fullscreen + windowed mode as well.   Do i recommend this game?   Why are you still reading this? Seriously go and buy it NOW! It's way more than worth your money.
ffs
Was recruited to purchase this by furry friends to write down a detailed recap of the entire story.   Started to receive questions by other friends about what I'm doing.  Explained I was playing it just for the story.  It's probably easier and more believable if I say I bought it because it's pornography.  Please believe me.
Catgirls gave me Diabeetus. 12/10 would play again.
GAME OF THE YEAR !!! =w=b
Pay 9 Euros for stop motion anime ... And bouncy chests .  SImple Visual Novel . Bought it with hope that cards will be added soon .
Preface: I have the 18+ files copied over to maximize my experience   so, i played for about six hours on the first start up of the game, annd I got to the first H-scene and boy was it good. The motion animation style that is used in this game enhances the eroge experience  greatly.   There is something I noticed while playing (if you copied over the files from 18+ ver). You won't get any  chievs if you don't put this code   -steam="yes"     into the start-up options for the game
I love love love this game, It so adorable, so wonderful it has everything in it. It made me happy, made me cry, made me blush, made me smile, giggle and laugh. It has literally made me feel so happy, I can't wait to get the other games and I HOPE It comes soon because I will pay as much money, to get it. I love love love it  There is only one thing I wish I could do, options. I want to be able to decide what I say, if I wanna be super-duper ultra nice and romantical, I want to.  Still though, amazing game and I love it. It makes me feel so happy, that I got lost in it. It makes me wish to live in that universe then this one.
If you have the choice of owning a nekogirl bakery or saving the world, what colour of shimapan will your favourite nekogal be wearing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
10/10 [Spoiler]  Almost died from having too much love with them. Best way to die.
I am not a hentai.
Classic.  10/10
Similar to Sakura Spirit; this kind of isn't a game, its more like an book in some aspects.  But unlike Sakura Spirit, Nekopara has actually shown some heart and care, and has put in both voice acting and done some very fluid animations for pretty much all scenes.  The steam version has a good chunk of the adult content cut out; but I am told that it is possible to go find the 18+ version elsewhere; if you have the money for both, you can technically combine them so your playing through the steam overlay and getting the achievements, while at the same time getting the hentai content originally created for the game.  I imagine the 18+ content was left out for child/family friendliness... or else theres intentions to make it as separate dlc content later on. Don't know.  Also unlike Sakura Spirit, I can actually stand to read what the main character is saying.  Not to mention the storyline for Nekopara looks, so far, like it will be far longer than Sakura Spirit, and with a good deal more thought put into it; even if it is sort of more of a "slice of life" modern day fantasy setting.  Would I recommend this? Yeah, the creators did some good work on this, and theres real quality in it.
6 Hours in the game and all I can say is... wow.   This game is really good and enjoyable. My only complaint with the game is its cost. Now, if you have money to casually spend then by all means go ahead and buy this overly cutsie Neko paradise visual novel. But, if you don't have money to spend casually then I would not reccomend buying this game.   I'm not saying this game is bad or anything, I enjoy playing it. I'm just saying for 9$ you hardly get anything, The game can be finished easily in under 5 hours.    Overall Rating I'd give it. 8/10  If money isn't a problem great game to buy.
The Bar school examination is near but I'm stuck with this.....  Damn! I shouldn't play this in the first place (T-T).
I can't find the exit button.  Send help.
This is a dangerous game. You can't explain anything. Don't do it man. You'll lose things. Things you can never get back.  Highly recommended.
This is the only game on Steam with a Chest Bounciness slider in the Options menu.  My parents must be proud of my choices in life.
A cat(girl) is fine too... bleached underpants version or not.  Here's to NEKOPARA Vol. 2 having even more (some alternate routes would be a good start) and leaving nothing essential aside!  (No, yon ero ones, the H-scenes are not essential.)
got this game thanks to a friend, why does nobody believe me.
OH MY GOD, THIS GAME THIS GAME IS SOOOO CUUUUUUUTE Sexy too. If you buy it, (which you should) you will not be disappointed, ESPECIALLY if catgirls are your thing...~
i pressed p and got an achievement since it made booby bounce  vol 2 come faster   10/10
So~~~  Everyone here knows what he or she is in to I hope. The full version is an adult visual novel, this means there is r18 content.  Now, for those that are conserned, the steam version cut out all the r18 content. It is possible to enable the full game on steam if you have the files from the uncut version.  I have played throught the full version, so including the r18 content. Please do keep that in mind while reading the review.    Once again, everyone here knows what he or she is getting in to. Nekopara Vol. 1 is the first chapter about you, you are making a new start by starting up an patisserie called "La Soleil". While you are moving you notice 2 extra boxes, seems like some catgirls from home snuck along for the ride! You start of by wanting to send them back home, but they really do not want to be seperated from you, they plead, they beg and the amount of willpower you can muster start to falter. They can stay.  and this is the start of your adventure ;)  Now about the game itself. I really enjoyed the story, I found it well thought out. Vanilla and Chocola have a good back and forth compatability, and while this may be subjective I really liked the way they voiced them. The voices fit really wel, this has also been done for other recurring characters! I would like to note that on auto reading it will take you just a bit less then 6 hours to finish Nekopara Vol. 1  As for the visuals, this is somewhat unlike a normal visual novel. Normally VN's are like a picture book, the pictures are still and the picture changes when something happens. In Nekopara Vol. 1 small bits and pieces have been animated.  This small addition made it really nice to watch what was unfolding. The background and overall characterdesign are really well done as well in my honest opinion.  The music was ok, nothing too memorable there but it is good for what it wants to do. I have not had the feeling that it was annoying or anything of the likes in the whole playthrough.  Also there is one thing I want to say about the settings. There is a "Boob bounciness" setting, you can set it from no movement at all to gravity defying so~ This was weird to see in the options, but thank you Sekai Project for implementing!  Last thing, more than once I got a message from my friends that looked something like this: "What the heck are you playing?!?!?" So be prepared to be judged by your friends.  Now as for my recommendation, I will recommend Nekopara. I will however say that the r18 version is the one you want. I will play through the cut version to see what the impact of the cut has on the Steam version. The art is very nice, I liked the characters, the music wasn't great but it was passable and there is an very interesting settings option.   Now I just want the Steam trading cards and I'm set. ... ... At least untill they announce Nekopara Vol. 2 :')
Someday I will make genetically modified catgirls but for now this will do as I brush up in my science and get a master degree in making this a reality for people everywhere.
10/10 Would bathe with catgirls again.
In a shocking move sayori releases the prequel to the beloved h manga series "neko paradise" featuring the two iconic characters, chocola and vanilla. the amount of artwork sayori has already done of these two shows how much she loves these characters. with sayoris typical attention to detail, down right gorgeous artwork and animated on screen avatars, this entry more then lives up to the standerd sayori has set for herself.  i bought the steam version and the DLsite version enjoyed both very much. support through donation! sayori is one of my top artists along side Kizuku Aruchu and Coffe Kizoku. praise the sun!
Cat girls, bouncy boobs and kawaii overload. 11/10
I was playing the adult version when suddenly my cat entered into my room...  ... the mood turned really awkward...
TL/DR?  adorable and moe 10/10 #worthmoney  I'd like to start off by saying this is indeed an eroge but the clean version is as story-rich as the +18 version.  Really didn't want this game to have any sex scenes to maintain the purity and moe factor of this VN...  GODBLESS They removed the sex scene. I'm a guy too so naturally we all want some X here and there, but I don't want any XX happening when it involves my favourite fictional idol. Judge me all you want and say I'm immature and shit but don't you get frustrated when your favourite anime waifus gets featured in a hentai or eroge? (Unless you're really down-right dirty)  Nekopara is really heart-warming, adorable and gives you a very lovely nostalgic and lovely feeling though  ''If we really love you then even if it's troublesome we want to be with you. That is a reason to want to be with you.'' That quote was enough to make me buy Nekopara the story set out as humanoid cat-girls is really common but this has it that they have the mindset of both a human and a cat even as to get distracted by cat toys. Welp, Nekopara is seriously heart-warming like Little Busters! and lovely like Clannad (Not as sad as Clannad though)  **SPOILERS**   When Chocola was feeling the heat as she enters the ''mating season'', I was really frustrated at this VN that they'll be making this cute, lovely and innocently pure VN into another eroge. But then hey this is Steam so they removed the sex scenes (Thank god) and maintained the purity of this VN. Cinnamon however... Wtf, she gets aroused from talking about pollens and plants' reproduction?  Too adorable *^*
10/10    10/10   100/100   best game   BEST GAME!
We played it for the plot.
bit.ly/ 1AvvAIX for educational* (NSFW) purposes only.  I bought this just for the lols. But seriously though, amazing high defination animations.Beautiful artwork by Sayori. Funny storyline :]  The only game on Steam that has a "Chest Bounciness" slider in the options menu(I reccomend you put in on max). Absolutely revolutionary. English subtitles.. Very good fps, i have an avg. 200-600fps~    Looking forward to Vol 2 and hope they bring STEAM CARDS next time.  █▀▀░█░█░█▀█░█▀▀░█▀█  ▀▀█░█░█░█▀▀░█▀░░█▀▄  ▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░▀▀▀░▀░▀  █▄░▄█░█▀▀░█▀▀▀░ █▀█  █░█░█░█▀░░█░▀█░█▀▀█  ▀░▀░▀░▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░▀░░▀  █░░█░█░▀▀█▀▀░█▀█░█▀█  █░░█░█░░░█░░░█▀▄░█▀█  ▀▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░▀░▀░▀░▀  █▀▀░█▀█░█░█▀▀  █▀░░█▀▀░█░█  ▀▀▀░▀░░░▀░▀▀
Shut up and take my moneys
A "Chest Bounciness" slider? Dats some next gen shit.     420/420 would buy again.
Now that I've fully finished this game, I feel that I can now write something about this game.   For the most part, it's just a slice of life type game so if you're not into that, then save your $10. For the game itself, I really liked the artwork as that stood out to me the most (NIS, IF, Compile Heart pls take notes). The characters were okay but it felt like the story wasn't going anywhere. The H scenes are ripped out of the steam version so it leads the player on to sex then automatically reverts to after-sex. Felt that was kinda lazy as it could have been just re-written instead.  I'd give this a C. It was okay but could have been better.   If you like slice of life, catgirls, or little bit of funny here or there then I'd buy it.  If not, save money.
Several heart attacks were had from the cute and I've got that high pitched "goshujin-sama" stuck in my head. I await future volumes where I can hopefully see more of Coconut, Maple, and Azuki, the other catgirls the dude apparently owns. Owns.  You can also merge the H version with the Steam version so the Steam version would become the ecchi version while still acquiring achievements. Afterwards you'd just have to tweak the launch options a bit. Why you'd even do all this is up to you. Because I'm a degenerate however I did all this then enjoyed my extra hours and 3 scenes of catgirl hentai.
A short and sweet story about catgirls nothing less but maybe something more...
This game is beyond adorable. The entire story is well-written ((in my honest opinion)), the animations are as smooth as I've ever seen in the past and the artwork itself is fantastic.   While the game does have its "low points", some of it being grammical errors or cheesy story-writing here and there, Nekopara Vol 1 was an outstanding accomplishment. I hope that the developers are very proud of how well they did with this visual novel. I loved every second of the story, getting both versions of the game. The background music is very engaging and appropriate for each scene and chapter. The opening page of each new chapter is very well done and they each gave me a smile.  The story is very well-written, keeping me hanging on every word. Each character was brought out at the right time and presented in such a way that they never got old when ever they were brought back in. The only things I have an issue with when it comes to the narrative is that the sentence structure of "__ did __ when I __  __" I noticed it a lot during the beginning and middle portions of the narrative itself as I went through. Also, there were moments where the VAs could have expressed more emotion into the words they were saying in some parts of the narrative. I'd give examples, but I'd be too worried of spoiling the experience from other people. However, those are the only quips I have about the story writing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the animation of each character model. I feel that the developers should be very proud of how well they turned out. The thing about static character models is that you only get one face most of the time, with the only changes being when the character has a shift in attitude. The use of animated models are exceedingly better ((depending on how well they are done)) can give the player a much better view on what a character is feeling. In Nekopara, there were moments where VAs didn't express the seriousness of some of the situations. However, that was almost immediately remedied by the expression the character models presented as they moved and talked with the spoken words.  I just completed the full version that I got through other sources besides Steam and I cannot wait to see what the developers come up with for Vol 2
8/8 m8 would jiggle
This game...I swear I'm gonna die from cuteness overload. I love this game and it's really well put together. Worth the moeny completely. 10/10 would kawaii desu
9999/10 One of the best VNs for me <3
If you're reading this review then you're already too far gone. Buy the game you weeaboo~
I LOVE NEKOMIMIS.
If you're in to banging underage cats I would reccomend, because i sure as hell am.
If you could choose this over your wallet, how far are you in to the game?
For those who are curious, NEKOPARA also runs on Microsoft Windows XP (which I use).  This is a very touching story.
The outside world may think I'm a pervert, but who cares what they think, as long as I have my catgirls I'm happy.
game sucks really bad.
A game perfect for Michael
Boobs at ultimate jiggliness    10/10 would probably jiggle again
There is no actual game here.  To put this on Steam with no gameplay at all is fraud.
Neko, Neko's everywhere, I can now die with no regrets...  (dies from nose bleed)
It's really cute, I do like the story of it so far :)
Well, I played this VN quite a lot over the past week and got into it quite quickly,  Its a good story with epic Nekos, Defintley Chocola and Vanilla, I truthfully can't put too much into this review becuase it might spoil it so i just got say the story is great and the music helps create the mood, it almost feels like im watching anime, subbed like i usually do...  Now if you do get this game and play it through you will be asking this question im about to place, Is or when will the next VOLUME GOING TO BE OUT!!!!
Implicit sex.
A cat is fine too.
playable with one hand
The dialogues can be rather stupid and quite often i found myself facepalming because it was so goddamn ridiciolous but who cares, THERES A FUCK*NG CHEST BOUNCINESS SLIDER.  Although I had to use my imagination to put Morgan Freemans voice for the main character/narrator and Gilbert Gottfried's voice for the Chocola it still was a good Visual Novel.  The atwork is just beautiful with lots of attention to detail and the same goes to the animation except when they are leaving the scene on their magic segway.  10/10 would adopt a catgirl  PS. Tits are nice
Evryone laughs at me for playing this. They're just mad because they dont have qt cat girl waifus.
"The cuteness, The feels, it fills my lungs with pain...it hurts, it hurts a lot, but it also pleasant. *cough* *blood vomit* Spare me, please, spare me, O Benevolent Lord..." 10/10
Chest bounciness slider. 11/10, would nyan for days.
Game has option for Chest-bounciness. 10/10
wanna have a romance with a cat ? get this one
Got it as a gift. Obviously the best gift in my life so far ^_^
A really fantastic game, nice CG, nice music, and cute cats =w=
This game has really good story line, but I was kinda sad that they remove the choice option for this version of the game. And the game is only like 4 hours long if you choose the "Auto Mode".  I was expecting to be like maybe 6-10 hours of reading.  But over all the game is good and paying $9.99 is fair I guess.  So my rating would be 8.5/10 because of the no choice option and the game is a bit short for me. I do hope volume 2 would be out soon and it will be the continuation of what the story left off.
Does anybody know where to buy a new hand because you know..... I um....
...  I still dont know what i just played.
I like the motion of the art and how it jiggles, although no big boobs to apply the jiggle motion to. Not sure if there were any choices in the game cause I played it by pressing space and wanking to "erotic" moments. Over all, looks like garbage
got fps lag and the tick is bad and the awp is overpowered
10/10 Will continue when my family leaves again.
15 mins in and I quitted. Unless you enjoy massive amounts of reading and you're pervertly desperate enough to wait up long walls of text until a boob or two shows up (which I assume it happens because I got the full version I assume), this game is a no brainer.  If you want reading, go read a book. If you want porn, redtube.com and jack off to that. This is as desperate as it can get. Call me gay, because I AM, but it's still no excuse to plant long walls of text and little to no interactivity just for the excuse to show a boob or two.  And yes, I admire japanese stuff. But for better japanese games, hell, there's Metal Slug, or any anime videogame that doesn't imply in as little interactivy as clicking through screen to screen. You want to speedrun this shit? Ok, then spam the left mouse button. That's it.
Well it was entertaining, seeing live 2D in visual novels. The H scenes in the R18 version are a must if you like those stuff since, for once in VN history, has an animated h scene.   They tried to play some feels at the end, BUT THE EPILOGE, the epilogue basically confirmed my purchase for volume 2.  Recommended if you;re looking for something light to read, and for that pricetag? c'mon its a steal
11/10  SO Kawaiiiii Best Game Everrrrrrrrrrrrr
It’s been a while since I played a visual novel, and unexpectedly this became a reminder of why I like them. Nekopara is dubious to say the least, as it’s a story about a man getting sexually involved with cat girls.  This is designed to provide relief from the horrible reality of every day life. The world of Nekopara is bright, pure, and uncomplicated. It’s full of love and hope. Whatever happens in the world, it’s never sinister, never dark. The most dramatic thing that happens is people getting sick. And because the stakes are so low, it manages to get some drama out of everyday events. The world doesn’t go under, nobody is hurt, nobody dies.   It delivers exactly what it says on the box. Definitely not for everyone. Can’t deny I found it pleasant, and it made me want to play more visual novels. Not because I crave more cat girls in my life. I just enjoy the process of playing them. Because you click to get the next line of text, you feel in control of the pace. Nothing punishes you for wanting to take it slow, or if you blaze through a scene. Unlike games the story doesn’t go on break. Every click advances the plot. Visual novels are their own thing, separate from games, film, books or comics. I like their mechanics, and the possibilities they provide for telling stories in ways which blur the line between mediums.  Nekopara doesn’t try to do much. But for what it is, it’s well put together. It’s enough to make me excited about playing other titles with more ambitious stories. And that’s enough for me to not harbor any negative feelings toward the title. I’m glad Steam has become a place where both this and Hatred can co-exist.
I thought this would be a joke and just be something you would buy once and stop once you barely got into it, but I was very surprised to find that it was very well done. The story was interesting, albeit a little gratuitous, it had interest that went beyond just having cat girls in a game, but it had an interesting world and motivation within it, with each character having different drives, opinions and personalities that work well in the game. Twas a good game/visual novel. GG 10/10
10/10  1.6 GB Download Awesome Graphic Work smoothly at 4k monitor(3840x2160) Chek my SS if you need prove Nice Gameplay This is totally masterpiece lol And they're actually moving and breathing not STIFF as the other VN!!!
First time doing a review have to say the game is worth the money. Such a light and fluffy atmosphere that just makes your heart soar and since it is a story book just a fun little digi manga I would like to call it. This digi manga could just brighten one's day with just a few simple minutes and the save mecanic can let you save at scenes that you like so you may rewatch them.
this game is like watching a japanese man play zoo tycoon
Possibly the most cunning diobolical gift I have ever received. The cute levels were just off the charts and mesmerizing with the subtle animation. If you do pick up this or end up being gifted it make sure to set bounciness to maximum gainax levels. Trust me, you will not regret it.
This video sums up the entire game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXPeLctgvQI
Don't tell me how to live my life
This is not a game,  i bought this with the understanding it was a dating simulator but no its just a story with zero interaction.
What the actual fuck did I just get gifted to me?  I don't know.  You don't know.  But I...  Like it?  I don't know!  Never have I been so confused by a...  Is it even a game?  It is more like a video novel.  I dunno.  Something catgirl something something.  All you need to know (or will probably ever know) about this...  thing.
Who needs a social life when you can spend 10 dollars and get a catgirl harem?
Short but sweet slice-of-life VN about a guy and his cats. Beautiful artwork by Sayori, and an entirely competent error-free translation courtesy of Sekai Project.  My personal advice would be to buy the R18 version from the [url=http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE144678.html]English DLsite page[/url], as for its short length (5~6-ish hours) there  is actually a fair bit of the lewds to be had. But if that aint your thing, then the All Ages steam version is great and suitably cheaper for the reduced content.
Has a chest bounciness slider option 10/10
Too much bounce 11/10
love the style the story is beautiful it is a great visual novel i love it and definetly give it a green light glad the price was reuced for what cintent it removed to be allowed up
Game of the year edition inbound
If you love cat girls and visual novels this is the one for you. It has a great story line and the character design is amazing. Overall I say this is one of the best Neko visual novels you can get trust me.
10/10 chest bounces
I have issues. 11/10
10/10
Honestly. Yes this game was enjoyable. Yes it was cute. But it was NOT worth even nine dollars. Why? Because that playtime? It's all it takes. Every achivement, the whole story done. That's it.   On top of that it's only Vol. 1. meaning you're only getting the first part of a story.  And to top the cake off it's a HEAVILY cut version.   With all that in mind, yes you culd play this for some cutesy but still not worth 9-10 bucks.  If you want neko porn just go buy the full R18 version.
I can't get a girlfriend in real life, so this is a close enough substitute.
Best Visual Novel in steam i ever played! 2D catgirls better than real girls :3  10/10 can't wait for vol.2
Ever since I saw Chocola and Vanilla a couple of years ago, I fell in love with their cuteness, and now after finally playing the demo and buying the game, watching them move, their cute voice, all the nya, I felt like my life came to be complete, I believe I started the year with the right hand. My first reactions when playing were something like this "HNGGGGG, MY HEART" or "Y U SO MEAN, SO CRUEL" or even "MEOWWWWWW".  TL:DR- Now all my friends can see what I jack off to.
DO NOT BUY THIS AS A CUTE GAME FOR YOUR NON GAMER GIRLFRIEND
This is "teeth gritting, fist down my throat" sickeningly cute. Even before the "Oh my God what the hell am I getting in too" horrifying truth of it's orgin. With bottles of various alcohol to lessen your suffering. I recommend this.
I have to say, after playing some of the other VNs on steam, this one stands out above the crowd.  The animations of the characters, while a bit distracting at first, brings a sense of life to the story.  If you are fond of cats, catgirls, or cuteness in general, I would recommend giving this a try.   While this is the edited version of the game, the scenes that were cut out seem to not make a difference in the overall story, but are more or less fap material.  I originally was disappointed, but after finishing the game, I can say that I am perfectly comfortable not having seen the romance scenes in graphic detail, and the rather coy way that the game eludes to them makes it more cute in a way.    Anyhow, this is worth the price in my opinion, and I am genuinely happy that it caught my eye.  I am looking forward to Vol. 2.
This game is amazing, and that bounciness setting? Uh yeah!  I also reccomend the patch, but BEWARE.... Sex for days.  Cute game overall
Im loving all this pussy
"A real female of course, smells, is dirty.. of course because it's a human being, it has lots of things. So we have this anime, isn't it clean and pretty?"  -Masanobu Sato  [spoiler] https://www.fakku.net/doujinshi/neko-para-01 [/spoiler]
I used one of my fapping tissues on this...for my eyes.  EDIT: Okay, I used one on my cock too.
Received as a gift. Story is predictable and definetly meant as 'wank material'. Artwork is well done but otherwise I found the story boring. I guess at least it's easy achievements.
Played it on Stream.  Lost half my regular viewers.  No regrets, gained two catgirls as waifus.  My life is kanpeki.
Best visual novel involving catgirls ever.
i wasted money on this crap and im wasting time on this crap 10/10 would recommend
Oh man, cute nekogirls AND JoJo reference... 9 Speedwagons out of 5 Whams  http://prntscr.com/5ofwgl ^JoJo reference from game
can easily be played with one hand, best in short bursts with the door closed  Tip For Beginners: If someone calls for you, never say "J-Just a minute!" because everyone knows what that means
Great game with long-needed features; a real revolution for the genre. You can adjust the chest bounciness. 14/10 best 10 bucks ever spent.
[Meow!..Meow!..] My favorite game ,  i wanna steam card game of Nekopara and profile background. love Nekopara ^^ 10/10
I-It was a gift, I swear!  On a serious note though:  It's pure fanservice but quality-wise an exceptional visual novel with fully animated character models, fully voiced and lip synched, accompanied by a pretty generic but a nevertheless fitting and chilling soundtrack.  If you are into catgirls, get it. But I recommend the patch which adds removed 18+ content.  Because apparently you can only slaughter people in the cruelest ways possible without caring at all, but showing love and affection to each other is something to be condemned.
I can't hear you judging me because I'm drowning in cat girl maids
Quite disapointed that the packaged version (The full game which includes all scenes) of the game isn't available even as an option for this game, cutting out half of the meaning of the game. As currently released, even for all aged people, the game comes dangerously close to content that's not appropriate for all ages. However if you are a fan of nekomimi or follow neko works, this game is still possible to recommend for it's high quality cat girls and it's fantastic animations for sprites that you don't often experience in visual novels.  Overall if you don't mind being robbed of almost literally half of the game because of restrictions, then this game can still stand for the story. However if you have ever read NekoPara or took a glimpse at it before then you'd probably be disappointed cause this game has almost nothing in common with what you have read before. And if you're reading reviews on this game in the first place, you probably arn't just looking for cat girls innocently playing around.  You horny pastery puffers!
SUGOI MUCH KAWAIINESS
Good
- Nice story - Cool soundtrack - Hentai...Of course I love it :3 Who wouldn't love hentai? :3 - Chest Bounciness~  Hentai/10 (Would read & fap again) Give us 18+ version plz
This game is so kawaii it hurts.
I had no regrets getting this VN. When it came out with the discount before new year's i snapped it up without hesitation, and after the full playthrough, i really recommend it. Eventhough its a simple VN, its wonderfully simple yet emotionally alluring storyline just makes it even better with its Original Soundtrack.  Looking forward to playing the second volume...
8 million years of evolution , 2.5 million years of constant technologal, engeneering and science has brought as into the wonderful world of 2D "chest bounciness" slider ...  10/10 would para the neko again !
Absolutely recommended for anyone who likes cute things!
>Launches the Game >Goes to Config >Effects and Sounds >"Chest Bounciness"  This gon' be good  But really, your typical Jap culture at its finest. Bringing you all them adorable nekos (plus lovable imouto) in your life. PS: Rule 63 Rengar inbound   TS:DR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjQm1ICjtvA
I have hunted virtual zombies, monsters, bad guys, ect. for eons emotionlessly: all without shedding a single tear.   Then I read the first chapter of this game.   I literally had my cheeks full of tears, all the emotions came out.  WHHHYYYY!!!!!!!!!?????
This is the true next step in Visual Novel Technology.  They are animated! they sway, they have chests that jiggle, they lean in and out, they have mouths that move when they speak, they blink, and...  They are Catgirls! There is no reason not to buy this marvel of VN Tech!
Kawaii! <3
NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is most likely the defining game of our generation. The subtle plot points intertwined with riveting character development create a gameplay experience that rivals Skyrim with Guns 2: Revengeance, while the superb graphics put Crysis 3 to shame.  10/10, It's okay.
I hav been playing visual novels before, but this one takes the cake. Great story is very importent to keep the intrest up. But one thing that was superior in this one, the visual was outstanding. Top class animation of the characters sets possible a new standard.  You can see they have put a lot of work of this game and I can not wait for part 2.  This gets 10/10 from my part and I suggest you try it out, you will not get dissapointed.
I bought this ironically I SWEAR
this game makes me feel like i can actually talk to females 10/10
I highly enjoyed this game. It is cute and the story isnt bad. Its so good that i want to find the 18+ version somewhere. XD its nothing too bad. It is so Kawaii. would recommend as a gift to girls, or to high strung teen boys (and otaku's alike)
Despite what others are saying, you really only miss three scenes from this if you get the Steam version.  Do not take this to mean that you can play this in front of your family. No game that has a "chest bounciness" slider and lets you shake the game window to move boobs (for an achievement no less) is "family friendly".  On the plus side, more attention and detail is paid to the idea behind catgirls existing with humans than I thought would exist in a game this shamelessly cute.  I personally liked this quite a bit, but I imagine this is a game with really split opinions. The demo will tell you everything you need to know about whether you will like this or not.
It has Catgirls. They don't hate me. They are girls. They jiggle.   10/10 I am a failure to my family and the world.
Its just so good   10/10 ign
You may call me a loser, but this is what I want for my life!
this game was verry fun to play and super cute
No catgirl. no life!
10/10 "No waifu, no Laifu" ~ign
ign: why is there so much weeaboo / 10
I'm sorry, but at this point, everything is just one big let down.
Set Chest Bounciness to max.  ITS LIKE A FUCKING EARTHQUAKE 10/10 would sex cats again
Best. Gift. EVER!!! Of all time.
fluffy tails
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGG  *collapses*
NEKOPARA isn't a game. It's an amazing Visual Novel, and I recommend it extremely. We play as Kashou Minaduki, he moved out from his home without telling anyone, in order to open his own shop "La Solei" But soon after moving in, 2 giant boxes get send to him; Inside of them are Chocola and Vanilla, the two catgirls from his original home, who want to be with their master. And this is where the fun begins. Chocola and Vanilla are two catgirls who want to be with their master a lot, even when Master doesn't want them to be here, because he wants to have a fresh start: They don't wanna go away. Master was the person who cared about them the most, and they don't wanna leave Master. The soundtrack is pretty great, and fits for each respective scene. Voice acting is done nicely, and all the characters sound extremely cute.  And the animations and art in general, it's so great that I can't even believe it. It's done smoothly, and cutely. In other words, in the best way possible. And if you're trying to learn Japanese/Chinese, then this game can even help you with doing that. There's an option to turn on both, English and Japanese/Chinese subtitles at the same time, so you can learn words easily. As the game goes on, the characters are developing over time, in a very good way. The story is very good too, it introduces every character in a good way, and explains nicely what's going on at all times.   I would tell you a lot of more reasons as to why I really like this VN, but if I did I would spoil a lot of the game, and I don't want to do that.  In other words, if you like visual novels and/or love adorable catgirls, get this game. I cannot wait for vol.2, which will probably be amazing as well.  10/10  *Nyaaaaaaaaa~!
Simply put, it's a cute game. Having been a fan of Sayori's art for a long time now, couldn't let this slip without playing it.  Can't wait for Vol2 to come...
It is a great time to be a kemonomimi fan.
get r18 files  rub rub rub it  profit
Too much kawaii for me - 11/10  #NoNekoNoLife - 51/10
Cute visual novel love the storyline so far, of course anime and cat girls <3 The visuals are great and its nice with the little animation as it does not look stiff as some visual novels that you can find. Also the achivements are pretty random to get xD
Mother this is who I am, the real me. The me who loves catgirls doing cute things.
I'd just finished playing this game, this game is a wonderful game i love it. while i was playing this game i really feel like I'm kashou and when ever chocola or vanilla get sad , I'm sad too. overall my opinion this game is awesome  I'm waiting for Nekopara Vol.2 please make them soon
The world of this game is illogical, like the human heart.  Despite all rational arguments, this game has all my heart. <3  Plus, kitties. :3
So good, I bought [b]8 copies[/b]. ㅇㅅㅇ
Can change ''Chest Bounciness" level - 11/10  Cat + Girls = Ultimate combo  Don't even care.
Do you like cat girls with super-kawaii-desu-nee voice acting? Do you like cat girls? Do you like cats in general?  Then this is the game for you!  Bonuses include but are not limited to a chest bounciness option, catgirl harem, and loli imoutos
It's time to go full otaku!  I like how more and more visual novels are released on Steam!   Too bad they've cut out the eroge stuff on the steam version. :3
So kawaii it needs a trigger warning.
Already played non steam version. and yeah, it's good for lonely ppl. This game will warmed your cold life.
First of all, as you should know, this isn't a game. It's a Visual Novel, which is kind of like a book with a more visual focus. Most VNs have some gameplay elements, like picking a choice and thus altering and/or branching the story slightly or majorly. THIS VN HAS NO SUCH THINGS. There is absolutely not one single choice in this, and as such, it can't be called a game at all.  Well, a book is fine too.  Now then, for a VN, the UI in the game is superb. Pretty much only outdone by Majikoi. Let's see now: + The default resolution is 1280x720, but the game has 10 hotkeys for resolution ranging from miniscule 320x180 to 1600x900. You can also stretch the window to whatever you want and use "Lock resolution to (your current window size)." This makes it easy to just stretch the window into 1920x1080 and lock it there. When you next launch the game, the game will remember your locked resolution. - The game tends to go to 1921x1080. If you're autistic like me, you'll be resizing until you finally get the proper 1920x1080. + The game upscales BEAUTIFULLY. I do not know what resolution the ingame files are, but I cannot notice the upscaling pixels at all at 1080p. If the ingame files really are 720p - and why wouldn't they be since that's the game default resolution? - then this upscaling is by far the best I've ever seen. + Full controller support, you can rebind keys in Advanced Settings. + Multi-core support. At least, that's in Advanced Settings... but I honestly can't tell the difference on my computer so it may or may not work. By default it's in 1 core, but you can set it to Auto (why is Auto not the default option...?), 2, 4 or 8 cores. + Steam Cloud support. By default it's on Automatic, but you can manually opt to "Update local save data to Steam Cloud," "Download save data from Steam Cloud" and "delete save data from Steam Cloud." - Overly zealous Steam Cloud support. I'm not sure does the game store your config and savefiles on your computer at all by default - they're stored in Steam Cloud. At least, when I turned off Steam Cloud automation I lost everything until I manually used "Download Save Data from Steam Cloud." I would recommend that the first thing you do when you launch the game is taking off Cloud support (and restart the client) so that you won't get screwed over incase you want to continue playing (read: reading) offline. + The File menu can be hidden with a nifty little X. Pressing Alt will, as always in Windows, bring the File menu back up - this time with a nifty little + if you want to unhide the menu. + Triple language support. The game comes with Japanese dub and the text comes in English, Japanese and Traditional Chinese. There's a separate setting for System as well for the same three languages. + Dual language display support. You can set the text language to Japanese/Chinese and select "Simultaniously display text using System and language setting" and you will get both your System language (English, I assume) as well as Japanese/Chinese. Want to brush up on your moonrunes? No problem: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=368457378 + The E-Mote system, including the famous Breast Bounciness Slider. More of which later (at the very end, actually). + Everything else you'd expect from a quality VN UI, like volume adjustment per character and message window transparency.  Now then, after advertising the great UI... what else is there to say?  The "game" is SHORT. You might blaze it through in two hours and I wouldn't be surprised. This is, however, a cheap title and "Volume 1" so I find this entirely acceptable. For your money's worth... this VN by far surpasses Sakura Spirit (which at the point of this writing) is pretty much the only competitor on Steam. I'd personally recommend even full price on this title.  Plotwise, the game doesn't offer you much. If compared to Sakura Spirit, this game at least has consistency and doesn't feel like short sketches just slapped together. It's just small "slice of life" cut. Other than that, you can pretty much just expect cuteness rather than character development. And bouncing breasts (unless you set Breast Bounciness Slider into "The British Royal Guard" setting like some other Reviewer said).  The Steam version is the "All Ages" version. The full game has pornography which is forbidden on Steam. You can buy the full game from elsewhere (costs roughly double compared to the Steam version) and extract it over the Steam version. If you launch the game with -steam="yes" option you can use the full version on Steam with no problem. Achievements and everything works perfectly. I would strongly advice you against posting screenshots of adult content into Steam Cloud, however.  The English translation is iffy at times. If it was a free game, the slight iffyness would be at a fully acceptable level. This is a commercial product, so it's not acceptable. The demo had a DREADFUL translation and thankfully, the translation has noticeably improved from then. Not to perfect though, sadly.  Voice Acting felt good to me. I have absolutely no complaints. I will not praise any VA into the heavens either, but they did a solid job if you ask me.  Music is not a strong point of the game. There are no fantastic tracks in the game, but no dreadful ones either. Some musics successfully set the mood right so it's not a complete flop.  Sound Effects... ... let me be honest, the SFX of this game are outright terrible. For a commercial product they are pretty much inexcuseable. In the Steam version they might be almost okay, but if you play the full version... eugh.  The strenght of the game when compared to other games is in the E-Mote system. Not something I can properly express in text - I'd suggest you YouTube search "nekopara vol 1 introduction" for the official introductions from Sekai Project. They should give you a pretty good idea on what the E-Mote system does. But if I were to try to explain in text... well, the girls move on the screen. Constantly. This is done by having multiple layers on the girls, and interactions of these multiple layers gives them a very, very wide variety of expressions - even more so since the game mostly has catgirls, which means that they have twitchy ears and a tail. It looks absolutely gorgeous. If I were to complain about something, it is that their up-and-down sway stops whenever they're talking. And that up-and-down sway is a bit over the top to begin with... anyway, it actually makes the game feel better OUTSIDE of the CGs. Because the CGs are static and only have a few expressions made into them. Usually, you want to see the the static CGs in VNs because those are the gorgeous parts - here it's in reverse! As I said, you have to see it to get a good feel of it. A LOT of effort was put into the emotions of all the girls, it truly looks fantastic.  tl;dr; If VNs are your thing, this is a short but quite solid experience. I give it my recommendation and I am looking forward to Vol 2.
its a very nice game. Cute characters design and music and shaking boobs. the animated character make it superb game. However those who are looking for a longer gameplay might be disappointed though.
10/10 IGN. :D
The only game on Steam that has a "Chest Bounciness" slider in the options menu.  Absolutely revolutionary.
Like Cat? Play this, Done.
spend money for this is useful, very cute game meowwwwwwwwww
nyaaaaaaaaaa~
Not the actual full version of the game! If you like games with deleted content and scenes that have been stitched together when really you're looking for the actual 18+ game don't bother buying this here! Look else where on the internet for it. When I buy a game I want to play it as intended not some butchered half ass stitched together frankenstein piece of shit. Dont' be fooled by the age verification and nudity tag this shit is about as pg as it comes.
soo kawaii
Buy the steam version, get the full version, combine the two by dropping in the full version files into the steam folder and add -steam="yes". Steam doesn't like lewd stuff but you probably do. You should.
Wasted CDN$ 9.89 on a boring game.
I Haven't played many Virtual Novels, but this is by far the highest quality one I've seen, Pretty much everything besides the character you play as (Which is you) is fully voiced, and the animation is great.
I got an achievement for making catgirls boobs jiggle (I won't spoil what you need to do to make it happen :3)  10/10  would jiggle again
I dont know why I have this game. I cant return it, its a digital copy. I've been questioned the first 5 minutes of gameplay.  "wtf are you playing" "what kind of fucking game is this" "weeb"  All I could respond with is: im drowning in mass amounts of pussy  Do I recommend this game? Fuck yeah I do.
This game is the best 9.99 you will spend on a game. There is an option to shake their tits gg buy this game now m9
I shared New Years Eve with kawaii neko ladies instead of my family. Then I wasted all my money in the full version of the game just to get it working in steam, and because of that I didn't went to visit my grandma saying that I was busy...  Would dissapoint my family again
No regrets
steam version needs more anime neko tittties u feel me desu 3/10
IT WAS A GIFT, I SWEAR!
Bias Review:  This game makes me wanna buy cakes and cookies and wanna own a nekomaid bakery shop. 10/10  Kitties touch your tail for you. 10hundred/10  Master Japanese & Chinese by reading all three languages. Totally educational. 10thousand/10  After reading nekopara, I cross play as Nekosojo to work office, and randomly set up a new year party. Totally awesome, would def do it again. 10million/10   Read Nekopara before going to bed, and get @##ed by Nekonoids while sleeping.  It was intensively awesome, would def get poned again. 10trillion/10.  Adult version can be fully combine with steam version and still get achievements R18 version is now my soul food. 10infinite/10  Do I recommended? Totally It helps you reborn to another magical dimention. .................................................... Serious Review:  ok, I am only talking about Steam version at here.  Good:  1. Kawaii Voice acting and character personality  2. Great art work, and it has tons of relative product, like hugging pillow, manga (all age, ichi and hentai) and such. Very good for fans and collectors.  3. Contains many useful vocaburaries in Japanese, thats good for Novice Japanese learner .   4. Bouncy Button is an interesting concept. Love it.  5. Good soundtrack and music  Bad:  1. This Visual Novel has good voice acting, but few scenes voice record quality is a little cachy   2. There isnt multiple ending or story routine you can choose.  3. Translation in Chinese can do better job.  4. To be honest, I dont think the story is very exciting, but the music makes it touching.  The main reason i bought this visual novel is because I use to follow his early work. I am happy to see the artist grow and improve. Hoping to see more of his work.  You dont have to like this visual novel, but its always good to support something you like.
chocola is waifu for laifu  10/10
Everything changed when the Lewd Catgirl Nation attacked.
I pressed "P"
played this game naked 10/10
It bothers me most that no one else is bothered by me playing this.
At first I got this for shit and giggles then I remembered it has the original version R18+, then I couldn't stop laughing. I once came across a jojo reference and flipped my shit thinking "Out of all the doujin VN's this mentions JoJo". By far 9/11 best hentai VN of 2015.
I bought this game twice in one day. You may ask yourself how, but that is because there is an 18+ version on dlsite and I am now 18, so I'll be damned if I don't have the extra content and the ability for steam to remind me that I have it.  This is a beautiful game full of bouncing breast and I feel no shame  I REGRET NOTHING!
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to read it again. This is one of the best visual novels I have read to date. The writing and voice acting is spot on and the animation is just wonderful. If anything, this is a must read (well, listen to really) visual novel that I would recomend to just about anyone. And, judging from the fact that this is just Volume 1, I can imagine that there will be more on the way. If so, I look forward to reading those as well.   This gets a mark of 10/10
Nothing to say. You can count on this game. Super Moe and great engine as you can see those breasts moving!
My thoughs on this game, simple brillent! plus a new way to see anime games like this and for those who have an open mind as well I say Nice job on it :D
Reasons to buy this:  Characters are animated for most of it and fully voiced for all of it. It contains cat girls. Moving the game window shakes the world creating jiggle. It contains cat girls. With a little bit of computer knowledge and some .ini files you can make it lewder.  Would recommend.
Like any game I play I first went to configure to check out the options. First thing I even touched and found was "Chest bounciness" SET TO MAX NO REGRETS INSTANT 10/10 GAME
[Chest Bounciness Intensifies]
This game is awazing.. but it think it needs trading cards
MEOW?! MEOW MEOW MEOW ?! RUB RUB RUB~ ME-MEOW MREOW ME-MEOOOW ME-MEOWRH MYAOW! LOL! 10 RUB / 10
The full adult version is 8hr long.  10/10 would do cats and get steam banned for adult screenshots again.
At first I was sad because of that feel when no gf. But then I played NekoPara and everything was okay. The game has everything you could ever want out a relationship, cute girls, affectionate petting, tragic backstories, jiggling breasts, you name it, this game has it all. Now I see the light. Now I understand why 2D is superior to pig disgusting 3D women.  Unlike 3DPD, Chocola and Vanilla love their master unconditionally and remain ever faithful, more than you could ever expect from some horrible, demanding women in exchange for a few measly hours of gratification. And even then, both Chocola and Vanilla are capable of providing on that level, so there is no real good reason to opt for a gf when you can have your own catgirl.  Thank you, NekoPara! You saved me from condemning myself to a life of torture in a relationship with some detestible flesh human and at a fraction of the price!
Nekopara is a beautiful love story between a man and his loyal cats showing him the value of family. It's the kind of light hearted love story that sincere, sensitive, gentle men would enjoy. Married men may want to sit this one out, but I would say it could make you more romantic and appreciative towards your spouse; clingy if you take it too far. And for any female gamers who may be interested in Nekopara: bless you for being able to step into a male protagonist's shoes and understanding.  I can not stress this enough: Nekopara is a heavenly fantasty that leaves you begging for more. Part of you will feel extremely satisfied after completion, but another part of you will be left longing for the warm embrace of a lover. IMO, these are very disirable feelings to have, and can only make you a better, sweeter person.  Nekopara Vol.1 is the first part of an upcoming series. And while the play time is only several hours, I think you may appreciate the low asking price. There is an adults-only version of the game available outside of Steam. You can read the discussion forum FAQ section for more information on where to purchase it.
This game is the Cat's Pajamas, but only a pussy would get scared of it.
Why cant i fuck kawaii neko girls???
This has a great story, set in the future of japan after an apocalyptic event, where a virus mutated people and cats alike. After the outbreak has been dealt with, the remaining humans had enslaved the feline people, and rebuilt society with them as the labor force.  R-18 patch shows the true nature of your character, and his slaves. I would recommend the patch, or else you are watching through rose tinted glasses, not seeing the full truth of this world.  It's a great metaphor for the catgirl illuminati and their true intentions.  It's up there right next to Deus-ex and metal gear solid 4's story line, I would recommend it to anyone.
100000noscopes/1 This is by far the best game I have ever played. Controls are ''Spacebar'' and ''Leftclick''
This game reminded me why we should stop the war on drugs to fund genetically created catgirls. 10/10 game would play in offline mode with the lights off and no one else home, truely a masterpiece of our time.
wasted my money thought this was the hentai version
...................... No comment..
Buy the 18+ version.
*Sees the game, wishes to have it* *Receives this game as a gift from friend, jawdrop* *Presses P to pause the game* *Boobs bounce*  10/10, would press P again.
This game awoken something in me that was sleeping for long time. I remember when I talked with my friends about creating game where you ware able to marry cat girl. I found a little part of script in skype history so I will show you it: "That time I wasn't able to understand my feeling, but when I saw her something fulfill my heart. Her soft and delicate fur gave me a new sense of purpose in my life, her warm brought me back streangt to live. I'm happy that she has chosen to stay with me. I love you my kitten." Now I think about it it's sad I didn't have enough determination to create this game and I think I'm pitfull for forgetting about it. But thanks to this game my love for catgirls has bloomed again. Thank you Nekopara. I think it's the best game for everyone, becouse who need other humans when you have catgirls?  100/10 becouse of love.  P.S. Ah and FAN MADE PATCH BANZAI!!!
steam needs more games with a "chest bounciness" bar
After a little tinkering got R18 version up and running, so i will spend holidays shagging drawn virtual anthropomorphic cats, and only God can judge me.           Now let's get serious. If you're on this game's store page, you already know what you're looking for. If by mistake you stumbled upon this and don't know what to do, i will explain:  1)This is an eroge, which means it's a picture book with music and drawn porn disguised as a game, where you "play" as self-insert main dude and swim in pussie. 2)Steam version have porn removed. Apparently game about having your own bakery with harem of submissive catgirls made by hentai artist is also suitable for children, so god forbid they see any adult content. 3)With a clever use of hands and internet you can still enable it 4)There's a slider that regulates how bouncy boobs can be: from "british royal guard" to "screw physics, full Gainax" mode. 5)There's 3 languages avaliable: english and two types of extraterrestial doodles. 6)You get Steam achiviements if you play it with extraterrestial doodles. 7)Art looks good if you're a fan of generic anniemays. 8)Actually animated. 9)In Russia it's possible to end up doing time for playing this. 10)Music is upbeat and voice acting is... ugh... 11)There's also apparently some kind of story. 12)Stuff like this stops me from reading serious vns. 13)There's nothing wrong and shameful in playing this. 14)Really.  If you ask me why should you buy something like this on Steam - hell if i know. I have no idea why its here in the first place. I will, hovewer, give this game 100 boob bounces out of 100.
Nyaaaan mew nya !  Nya, mew mew nyan nya, nyan mew myeow, NEKOPARA Vol. 1 nyan mew.  Chocola nyan myeow Vanilla, meow Master nyan nyan !  Myeow, nyan mew nyan, hyaun. Nyan nya mew.  Myeooow nyan mew 10/10.  Nya !
I fall in love with a fictional character again while playing this game.  10/10
Cats are great.  Boobs are great.  Cats + Boobs = 10/10
HOLY CRAP THIS IS SO CUTE 10/10 WOULD HNNNNNGGGGG
Catgirls in the heat. 10/10        PS: But seriously though, this is an amazing visual novel. BUY IT
0/10 Not enough pussy..  If you guys want the ADULT version of this game, go get em sons! You won't regret it. Kappa
Buy the game, download the non steam version. Replace steam version with the non steam version.  Like normal game but with LEWDS!
HOW ARE YOU NOT ALREADY PLAYING THIS?
i want this for a long time......and yeah that's come true, now i need to wait for the vol 2.....story is good, artwork is awesome, no "that" scene here in steam but it's okay for me, i seek for the artwork and story.....for the plus......THEY ARE MOOOVIING!, btw........gonna give this 15/10 hhihi, overlyoverwhelming positive from me, and for the other one gonna give 19.99/10
After my cats walked in on me playing this game they never looked at me the same.  10/10 has "Chest Bounciness" slider, and too many ribbons.
What do i care the most ? Lolis and nyaaaaaaaanssss ~ Art is very impressive IMO, the details in each chara design is just outstanding !  A little bit dissapointed for this game is not the 18+ version. But whatever, will finish this VN twice for the sake of achievement and 18+ CGs :D
This is a visual novel with catgirls (nekos) story  +Support English, Japanese, Chinese display +Dual language subtitle display +Japanese CV +Nice and clean UI design +Awesome character animations using E-mote tech +Full controller supported lol +Girls +Cats +Nekos! +Moe +Very moe +Just so moe  -Some story event is way too simplified.  e.g. exam for the bells -Steam version is not full version due to full-age released on Steam  A game which makes me delightful after playing lol Recommended to players who like Visual Novel and cats (and girls).  nya nya ~   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365366212   這是一個關於貓娘故事的視覺小說  +支援中英日三國語言切換 +支援雙語字幕顯示 +日文語音 +簡潔介面設計 +精美人物表情、走位、動畫，使用E-mote技術 +全搖桿支援XD +妹子 +貓咪 +貓娘！ +乖巧、可愛 +萌 +很萌 +還不錯萌  -某些故事橋段粗糙帶過，例如帶鈴考試那邊 -Steam版本不是完整版，因為Steam上架有年齡限制問題  難得一款遊戲讓我玩了心情變很好XD 推薦給喜歡視覺小說和貓咪(和女孩)的玩家  喵喵～
THEY BOUNCE.
In the immortal words of Kashou Minaduki:  "No Regrets"  10/10 would bang again
Very well made. The animations and voices fit perfectly. You really feel immersed within the world it builds around you. NEKO WORKS, keep up the good work!
The moral of the story: If you have a catpanion, you can die because of chronic fatigue.  r8 8/8
Kawaiiiii + Catgirls = Lovely <3
Played it through family share with my friend who is a huge otaku... I beat it before him and he won't forgive me. Once u get past chapter 2 you are fully ingaged in neko sex innuendos and strange but satisfying physics.   Either 0/10 cause I lost my best friend or 11/10 cause the games great, but i guess everything comes at a cost. :(
Simplistic as it may, the story has heart. Easy to read and easy to enjoy. Only downside is, it feels like watching a horror movie but without the horror and only suspense, if you know what I'm sayin.
YES.
THEY REALLY MOVE
Awesome game, short and sweet, but if you're looking for something with choices i would suggest something else. this is really if you just want a story thats super cute and enjoyable.
Great for VN and Anime fans.  The art is great, in that is animated and incredibly detailed. The moe level is through the friggin roof. Vanilla is the best girl!   NEKOPARA >>>>>>>> Family on new years.... and for eternity.
Lovely illustrations as expected, fully voiced and the animations really help to bring the cat girls to life!  A surprising amount of options for a VN, it might only be native 720p but it still looks and runs great and has many options for different scaling and cropping to full screen for any unexpected screen sizes.  I really like that it's possible to change languages on the fly and also to have multiple languages visible at once if you choose. It really shows the amount of effort that went into this release. It also has controller support which is handy for playing with Steam home streaming on TV.  It's a shame that the AO version isn't on Steam, but that's Valve's fault for believing that it's necessary to push American values on the rest of the world. You can buy the best version on DLsite and paste it over the top of the Steam version's folder for the best of both worlds.  Hopefully we get trading cards and cute backgrounds soon, that's the only thing I can think of that's missing.  Sayori is my hero!
Do you like Cats? Do you like girls? Then you will probably like catgirls doing cute things. If you expect a serious story, you are barking up the wrong tree.  Translation-wise(for english at least) its decent, but not perfect. At times you will be like "?!" because the english sounds awkward, but you should still be able to somewhat understand what it means.  Would i recommend it as a bestseller or kamige? No. But if you just want to enjoy cute things doing cute things, its worth the money.  Do note that I played the steam version, not the imported 18+ version to steam, so 5 hours should be approximately how long this game is, unless you read REALLY fast, or slow.
The best 8.99 i ever spent in my life. Neko girl 10/10 Highly Recommend
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Cat Paradise~  One, two, three, four, five If that's not enough for you, you're gonna enjoy this ride~ To the newly opened bakery around the corner The catgirls say they offer some cakes and creampies But I really don't wanna~ Pain de Sucre, like I had last week I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap~ I like Chocola, Cinnamon, Maple and Vanilla And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter~ So what can I do? Aim for the harem end, of course! To me playing this game is just like a sport~ Anything fly, it's all good, shut up and just play it Now please set in the trumpet~  A little bit of Shigure in my life~ A little bit of Chocola by my side~ A little bit of Vanilla is all I need~ A little bit of Azuki is what I see~ A little bit of Maple in the sun~ A little bit of Cinnamon all night long~ A little bit of Coconut here I am~ A little bit of you makes me your man~  *trumpets*  This is Cat Paradise~  *trumpets*  Jump up and down, maxing out that bounciness~ Shake your head to the sound, put your hands on the mouse~ Make sure you save here and another save file there One for Chocola's route and one for Vanilla's, Now Look around once and unzip your pants twice~ And if you bought the R18 version then you're doing it right~  A little bit of Shigure in my life~ A little bit of Chocola by my side~ A little bit of Vanilla is all I need~ A little bit of Azuki is what I see~ A little bit of Maple in the sun~ A little bit of Cinnamon all night long~ A little bit of Coconut here I am~ A little bit of you makes me your man~  TRUMPET!

Was told to press P... let coconut jump for 3h

IT'S THE ONLY GAME WE MUST BUY AT STEAM HOLIDAY SALE 2014 I NO LONGER WANT SHADOW OF FUCKING MORDOR BECAUSE I BOUGHT NEKOPARA WHICH IS THE KING OF THE STEAM GAMES IN 2014 I THINK IT MAY ALSO BE THE BEST GAME IN 2015
3Kawaii5Me
This game is all cute and crap, and then the shit hits the fan. 10/10, I played to to compleation.
I finished this pearl, no regrets! 11/10
Still playing.... Im batman~
NEKOPARA Vol.1 looks like it fits 100% into an outsider’s view of visual novels; a dull, fandom-focused story with pretty girls who do nothing but dote on you. Yes, these catgirls are pretty devoted, but there’s more going on than a simple harem storyline. One can’t help but be intrigued by Kashou’s devotion to baking, understanding both catgirls, and wanting to see everything turn out well. With that said, some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up. Others might be mad knowing they’ve missed out on some scenes due to Steam’s restrictions on adult content. Still, NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.  8/10
VANILLA IS BEST NEKO.
The  motion  in  this  game  is  fantastic  same  with  the  artwork.  As  a  anime/manga  lover  and  a  person  who  reads  a  lot  of  anime  visual  novels  i  just  cant  get  into  this game. The  plot  itself  is  just terrible  and  the  explaination  for  cat  girls  doesnt  make  sense  either. To  me  its  just fan  service, i  dont  mind  fan  service  but  with  an  unexcusible  plot  with  it  just  unsatisfies  me. Its  very  cute and  moe  but  i  cannot  explain  why  it  bugs  me  after  reading  it.  It  has  a  wonderful  system  i do  admit  but  i  hope  in  the  future  people   will  not make  visual  novels  with  motion  in  it,  that  to  me  will  just  ruin  visual  novels  itself  for  me.  One  of  the  settings  for  it,  is  Chest Bounciness, which  i  find  absurd  and  amusing,  i  can  see  why  people  would  buy  it  because  its very  cute  and  moe.  I  did  get  the  demo  for  this  game  and  was  thrilled  but  when  it  was released  everything  was  off  for  me. There  is  barely  any  character  development,  but  so  far  this  is  just  an opinion. Though  the  characters  personality  is  good  and  i  like  it,  but  the characters  postures  and  tone  of  voice  sounds  weird  to  me,  its  not  flown  well  with  eachother.    I  want  to  spread  anime  love but  not  like this, i  feel  like  the  anime  community  is  just  silly  and is  known  well  for  its  perverted  fan  service,  fan  service  isnt  bad  but  too much  gets  in  the  way  of  the  plot   thus  making  it  look  bad. This  game  offers  tight  clothing  and  a  lot  of  panty shots,  I  feel  like its a starting  point  for  motion  visual  novels.  I  believe  that  motion  visual  novels  wont  be  as  good  as  non  mottion  ones.  Ive  been  watching  and  reading  romance  genre  animes  for  almost  12  years.  I  felt  like  the  romance  in  this  novel  went by  too  fast  that its  unatural  and  has  no  reason  why  they  would  fall  in  love.  I  dont  know  how  the  main character  can  handle  2 l ove  intrests  either  nor  both  Vanilla  and  Chocola  can  deal  with  it.  My final  result  for  this  game  is 4.5/10  but  this  is  an  opinion  by  me  so  dont  let  this  encourage you  not  buying  the  game  i  say  try  out  the  demo and see if  you  like  it  or  not. (hey at least i didnt say it was crap, i didnt even compare to school days now that anime was an embarassment to all animes hehehe :p) I  know  most  of  you  will  not  like  this  review  but  stare  at  the cute  cat  maids. Feel  free to leave  your  opinion  down in  the chat  bar  thingy. ;)

Who need's a life when you have catgirls.
Top Tier Visual Novel  Animation is well done , voice acting is 10/10. subs are dead on.
Best Game on steam in my opinion  as i do love the story and art   note i love anime and cat girls
I saw the game on Steam with a -10% off and decided to read a review. [...] Bakery something something Catgirls something something [...]  ----> CHEST BOUNCINESS <----  "Thank you for your purchase." -Steam Store
Short version: Short, sweet, and just fine.  Long Version:  I think for the price, it's a bit much. The entire visual novel is about 5 hours long worth to read (And this is the adult version, so cut out 30 or so minutes for the smut) so it's a relatively short for a visual novel, however unlike other VNs, every character portrait is animated with the use of programs like Emofuri (Where each part of the character is held in different layers and are warped to give the illusion of breathing and physics)  The game comes in English, Japanese and Chinese, which is a HUGE thing as this is probably the first Visual Novel I ever heard of that had a simultanious international release. There was no wait time between the Japanese release and the International release. (Even the adult version has English text in it, however expect an additional $10 from you and to convert that money to Japanese Yen)  [b]So what about the content?[/b] It's a short story. You will probably finish it in a single sitting. The voice actresses are skilled, but the main female love interests both sound the same when their have to raise their voices. The window is easily resized and you can mute some characters you dislike (I didn't do this, though I was considering muting the minor nameless characters)  That aside, I think the game is worth it, the content is definately mature, but a lot of the "mature" content seems to have a lazy excuse to occure. Buy it on Steam, buy it on Nekopara's website, either works. It's short, sweet and just fine.  Bonus points because the art was made by a artist known as Sayori who has had her hand in some eroge Visual novels in Japan such as: Phi Age's "Owarinaki Natsu, Towa Naru Shirabe" e-xtreme's "Momoiro Taisen Pairon" And least we forget Sayori's artbook "Neko Works" A supurb artist, who finally has her original characters see a visual novel.
Anyone who love cats must try this game and "E-mote" system is awesome!
I only got this because Sayori. its not even good  P.S. chest bounciness pisses me off it's on the lowest setting for me now
kinky cat girls! :3 10/10
I hate to say this.... when is part 2 coming out?
suddenly get boner  this game worth to buy
WARNING After the Opening PLAY when you're alone... (a shower scene is incomming)
My Little Catgirl Simulator Can’t Be This Cute
This is now my favorite on vn on steam. If you like cute cat girls then this is a must buy.
According to gelbooru, it seems like I've been robbed. They took all the good and interesting stuff, like, porn for instance...
10/10 Nekogrill visual novel, it's recommended to patch it with the R-18 version for maximum enjoyment.
Yelled at my cat "[I]Why don't you turn to a catgirl ![/I]" after playing this game. Chocola's boobs / 10 , would spend entire holiday with chocola again   PS. Buy the 18+ version or read the H-doujin , you'll instantly lose your innocent soul
It is indeed a great game, just as expected form this publisher. I have yet to finish it but till the beginning of Chapter two it is an Amazing VN with great effects/ emotion system. You should really consider buying it! You will not regret it for the price of 10 bucks!
Nekopara is a cheerful slice-of-life story about you and the two catgirls who tagged along when you decide to leave the family business to pursue your career in cake making. Beautifully drawn and coupled with the animations and voice acting makes it one of the best presented VN's I've ever played.   The plot isn't really there plus around chapter 5, it starts to feel like a porno (as in 'my-cat-is-in-heat-and-the-only-way-to-help-her-is-to-get-it-on-and-not-read-the-pet-care-book-i-bought-a-few-chapters-ago'). However, the characters are interesting and the sprinkle of humor and cuteness through the game is enough to make you keep clicking forward. Also, small references.   Gameplay wise, it's linear,there are no branching choices at all. You can replay previous conversations (as in replaying the sound) but not 'reverse' back to a previous scene. No option to start at different chapters. You can hide the text box to view the scene better though.  Music is nice and comfy. Fits the cheerful theme of the game very well.    Overall, the game is like a cake. It's sweet and fluffy, but it's not very filling.   Extra notes: - Twins don't mind sharing.  - It can be played with a controller, but once the game starts there is no button to access the menu. - Vanilla is best
I masturbate to this. So this is why i bought this game.
YES
Allright firstly I never write reviews, however this will be my only time I break that rule of mine, this game is the absolute Holy Grail of all Visual novels.... It doesn't have any Trading cards (which is regrettable) however it is exceptionally well written and animated, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the japanese culture of Anime/Manga and as such I will give my one and only 10/10 to this Game (P.S I know its fanboyish)
lovable characters, good story, but its short can't wait for vol. 2
be warned there are no choices to be made this is all one story
This is the very personification of perfection. Catgirls, that is.
so many kawaii characters, likeable voices too!
I came for the catgirls  now I need to clean my keyboard
Ore no Koneko ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai  11.5/10 would adopt those 2
As a long time lover of cats, I was gifted this game by one of my friends who said that its something cats lovers would enjoy.  Thanks to the convention of language and things being lost in translation, as my friend is Russian, it turns out that by cat lover he means "making love to women who also are cats"  The confusion me, and my cats had, as a result of this game is well worth the purchase and I'm sure when I'm arrested by the government for this game, I will produce many laughs in court.  7/10, would be sent to prison again for.
my neighboorhood dont have any stray humanoid cat. this game breaks my heart
10/10 Would HNNNNNNNNNG again.

This game pulls at your emotions as well as any other visual novel.  Even know it lacks in choice (Not counting the options menu) it is not said to need it being a novel.  This is a good way to make a story look the same to a mass which if was just text and no image everyone will  view the characters and such in their own way. I also normally have my text speed to a very high speed but I found  the game would stop at mid word or sentence to force me to take a stop or period allowing it to flow better and seem  more real. Other then that the door bell ringing easily changed the direction of the chat for latter and kept the game  from dragging on. Overall this game has been fun so far and the developers studied and the English publishers clearly   did not skip out or water it down. I truly do not care so much for the 18+ version however it would be nice to have all  content available but doing so keep me from having any problems and I think it could be given as a free DLC for anyone who wants but steam may not like that also. My rating is 10/10 which I would rarely give but they covered so many bases with it that I cannot find much of any flaws and even know this is just a story they sure did make sure you are getting your money for it. I am now just hoping for them to put the soundtrack out.
If you love heart-warming story, get this! If you are into nekomimi girls, get this! If you love cute anime girls, get this! If you love pure visual novels, get this!  " if you want something else from the cuteness of catgirls (you know what I mean), please drop dead and go get yourself something else. "  bottom line, It is a heart-warming visual novels involving daily life of 2 catgirls and their master. If you enjoy reading, listening to the anime-like conversation, and overwhelming cuteness. GET THIS!
Neko's what more can u ask? 10/10
Soooooooo Cute!  If you like catgirls, this is a must.  Non H version so you don't need to worry about the people behind you :o
ala ala, only 2 hours finish the game,  it is not completed game,  too short and no x0x0 CG. this game is very expensive and not worth 10 dollars. but the other parts is good,  it still a good galgame.
gave me a ぼっき/10
I need a girlfriend. 10/10
It's CUTE GAME EVER !!!!!!! BUY IT NOW AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE :P " ซื้อซะไม่ทำให้ฟันผุนะเออ . . . แมวกล่องสุโค่ยยยยย ♥ "
Friends often ask me "why" when I boot up the game, so I set my status to "Offline" before playing this game.  10/10, would earn the ridicule of my friends again.
IT WAS WORTH IT!
just buy buy buy don't think so much
This game makes my penis go DokiDoki.
Anything with a "Chest Bounciness" slider gets an automatic positive review. 11/10 GOTY nominee right here.
If you are looking for a good visual that will give u a good smile, this is the one. Don't think just do it and get it.  Really the only thing i dont like is the "heat" considering how steam is doing this... This could of easily been done without it.... YES U GUYS THIS IS ORIGINALLY EXACTLY WHAT U THINK IT IS. look up the artist's name and ull see what i mean
Well... It's nothing special. Nice visuals, but that's all.
Chocolate and Vanilla that you know, will never be same again after playing this game. 11/10

Have you ever dream of a world where humans and neko co-exist.  Do you want to see kawaii neko grills do kawaii neko things?   Well this is the game for you.   Summary:  Nekopara is a visual novel based on the works of [Neko Works] which follows the lives of two neko, Chocola and Vanilla and their Master. They will go though a series of events which deepen their bond with their master.  Rating: 9 nyaas out of 10  Pros: - Neko grills  - Good voice acting - Deep story - Characters that actually move - Beautiful art  Cons: -Slightly generic background music -Censorship (XDD) -Lack of any user imput  My Review:  This game had me always entertain at every moment with moments of joy and sadness at times. What I enjoy the most out of this visual novel was its clear attention to detail with each character's facial movements (also the bouncyness of a certain body feature *cough*). The story is great with the great scripting with each character having lines well suited and the occational joke with the character taken to account. If you are willing to just have a game where you do nothing but read this is the game. The background music could be improved but all in all it does its job of creating the atmosphere of each event.   Note:  This is my first review of a game. I might have a thing for neko grills
I actually bought the uncensored version first and the steam version a few hours later. I even consider to buy the limited edition as well.  ALL THE NEKOGIRLS BELONG TO ME! YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM!    (Oh and btw. this steam version is censored so be aware of that before you buy it)
After this visual novel, I became a catgirl hoarder!  10/10 I would develop an Anxiety Disorder again.
ITTY BITTY KITTY TlTTlES
A VN so sweet and delicious it's bound to give you diabetes. Buy it! Hell, buy both versions while at it! (Steam & R-18)
Friend bought me this game for Christmas.  We are now married with three children. 10/10 would kawaii again.
3 Words: Bouncing Boobs Jiggulator... I mean Simulator
I always want to try one time to be a master of maid Neko girl
fuck some catgirls, what else you want
girl here think that i am a loser because i like the cute nekos but i think they are just jealous since they can't be as cute as these nekos
This game is graphically stunning and the romance between the characters is amazing. It has a chest bounciness scale, which is amazing, but if you want the true experience your gonna have to tweak it a bit to unlock the 18+ material but its worth it! 10/10. Catgirls FTW!
The amount of catgirls in this are over 9000!  All catgirls would play this again,  Neko/10
You may already know about the chest bounciness slider in the options BUT HEAR THIS:  If you move the game window around, the catgirls will also sway in that direction in the game as if they are in a container that is being moved around AND THEIR BOOBS BOUCE ACCORDINGLY. THERE IS ALSO AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR DOING THIS.  SCREW GAMES WITH 25 GIGS OF LIGHTING DATA. THIS IS THE REALEST NEXT GEN SHIT YO.  PC MASTER RACE WINS AGAIN.
Catgirls, what more needs to be said?
I've played this for 5 minutes and I'm already hard
Get this game  DL 18+  Copy/Paste  11/10
<3 Catgrils, they are teh coolest!
Went in for catgirl moey-ness. Got exactly what I wanted.  Shame Chocola & Vanilla are the only romancable characters. I wanted to see the MC get it on with his imouto
First off: if you're bothered for it being an all-ages edition, go get the R-18 version at DLSite. It costs 2160yen (around $17).  What has drawn me to NEKOPARA was, in the first moment, the art. Sayori's art looks so great, and I got really happy when I got notice that her circle, NEKO WORKs, was going to make a visual novel. I've had my eyes set on this since it was a Greenlight candidate, and F5'd my way to getting it as soon as it got on Steam (I literally refreshed the page a few times at midnight my time (6PM PST, the release time) so I could get the game ASAP).  NEKOPARA is a heartwarming story about a confectioner, Kashou, and the Nekos around him (though the story focuses on Chocolat and Vanilla, like on all of the NEKOPARA doujinshi by NEKO WORKs). It's a short and easy to read story that will have you giggle a lot, and feel warm inside too. I have to admit that Sekai Project's translation wasn't one of the best (as usual from them), but having played the game in both Japanese and English I feel safe saying that the translation doesn't kill the game's experience (and, the R-18 scene cuts can't be noticed at all).  If you're not looking for something with a serious plot and just have to take some weight off your routine, NEKOPARA is the right choice. If you plan on getting involved with a more complex and serious plot that will take up a lot of reading time, I suggest you go get something else, as this is NOT what you're looking for.  UPDATE: http://imouto.club/ddl/ has a reintegration patch (probably breaks Steam achievements, BTW) for the game to be really full, including R-18 scenes.
Sorry, social life. But, I must go. My catgirls need me.
I have a Black Cat Myself, and The story is nice too So yea 10/10
Vanilla best catgirl. Nya~   8/8 m8.
Nya Nya~<333 ^.^
this game is one of the best visual novel out there the characters are very cute and their poses are also very cute. it can be short but also really funny. i hope that there will be more volumes in the future, the only downside is that this version is a censored version of the 18+ version which means no porno scenes  other than that it's still a really fun and cute game
This is as lewd as a Steam VN is going to get.  10/10 would bath scene again.
As I've anxiously awaited for the d/l to reach 100%, I could only tremble in delight at the thought of neko. Once met with the main menu, my fears had come to pass and so, with a jittery heart and a steady soul, I launched myself into an eternity of cuteness that no simple man could escape from.   I... have become one with the Neko.
One day, I came home from work a little earlier than usual and found my cat-eared girlfriend in heat. She was really desperate and rolled around on the floor, sticking her rear up and groaning. So I, as the gentleman I naturally am, decided to relieve her.  It was quite the task to find a position I could feel comfortable in, since the difference in height is pretty big, but I managed and we got it going until morning.    Later that day, I bought Nekopara and it's pretty alright. 7/10
Got called a hentai baka 10/10 goty  also catgirls
Overall this game is nice. The new E-Mote System really did bring the characters to life, so kudos to the folks who created this game & a thumbs up for Sekai Project who released the English translated version of the game. While I do experience a slight issues, but all in all the game is of good quality.
The animation are so cute and the cv are just great!!  Like it!!!! Hope this game could have trading card and profile background...
Good for Fill of my Game Library Of Course I finished the Story 게임 라이브러리 채우기 딱임, 물론 스토리 다 봤지만...

I always loved Neko Works from Sayori, and now Chocola and Vanilla are finally in a game! :3 It's cuteness overload! :D
LEWD THINGS WITH CATGIRLS!!
The most Moe thing on Steam. Whole year has been validated by this purchase.   If it's your thing it will have you "kyaa"ing and "nyaa"ing and "awww adorable"ing and maybe a few less wholesome ings too boot.
Heeeelp meee!!! I overdose on kawaii! Nyaaaaaaaaaa~!!!
While Valve doesn't understand that adult content isn't only fappage material, but part of the story, play this game. It's interesting. And have Catgirls. Yes, Catgirls.    PS There is also Chest Bounciness slider :D.
Got it when it's still $10 (like, 1 or 2 minutes after it's out), I just can't wait.  Good job sayori, and big thanks to all who helped bring this to us.  And who voiced the bug!  Neko/10
Game of the year and there's only about 2 days left in the year.
love cat girl ? Glab it.
As if discovering the true meaning of your existence wasn't enough, this game will also increase additional costs to your health insurance policy with the recurring heart attacks and high blood sugar levels. That said, $10 will bring you fortune and happiness in your life, particularly through the form of cat girls. After I got this, I was immediately dragged out of my room and crowned the king of Scotland upon clicking on Chocola's bouncing boobs. Not only that, it gave me powers to fly into the air at supersonic speeds until I had reached Japan. It was there that I was bestowed upon Ken-Sama's blade on the top of Mount Fuji. I then journeyed all the way into the 2D world and slashed my way until I found the treasure trove with the remaining Volumes of this series. However, my strength, just like Goku's was not enough alone to unlock the gates to the sequels of this game. The world needs saving, and your donation of $10 could make the difference in a Catgirl's life.
This game is so saaaaaaad ;_;   10/10
So my family still think I'm some lowlife living in their loft with my waifu pillows and I can't really hold that against them cause it's true.  I think however, them seeing me on this game has led them to the verge of getting me counseling again but as this is a review of the game I can say, it's fucking worth it.   I played the demo for this game and by God was I blown away. The visual experience is astounding. I've never seen a visual novel look so amazing. The lip syncing is really good, the character animation is spot on and the general art is just brilliant as well. Who doesn't want to be surrounded by kawaii neko girls? That's right. Republicans.  The story is pretty good. You play as some guy who's fucking off to make his own bakery and become fucking Buddy Valastro from Cake Boss. Basically these cat girls who he's been living with while with his family go all Metal Gear in cardboard boxes in a moving truck to tag along with him and the story pretty much starts there.  They also have this OP song and video thing. Fuck me, it's like I'm on an acid trip. That shits amazing, like honestly, fucking amazing. I feel like I've been shifted from a visual novel to an anime. It's pretty crazy. Not only that, they've got a wide range of characters to meet so your not stuck with a few girls.   Might I also add that this game, THIS GAME! Has in the options a 'Chest Bounciness' option. Now, I'm pretty damn sure I'm not the only one here thinking this but DAMN! You know you've found a fucking good game when they have CHEST BOUNCINESS in the options menu. Genius.   Also I'd like to add that the price is great. The game is enjoyable and takes quite some time so for £6.99 full price or however much that is for 'Murica or other nationalities I imagine not that much more.   All in all, 10/10 will get hentai version.
cat is good Neko is good  awesome game  11/10  Vanilla is mine :P
Goodbye school *turn on the game* 420BLAZEIT/10 Cute Neko Girls,lucky bastard I wish I was like him Gabe plzzzzzzzzz release ero-ver

Found a takoyaki selling catgirl <3  11/10
this is super cute !! love vanilla and chocola the most ! they are sooo ADORABLE!!!
Cost of game: $10 Cost of diabetes treatment: $85000 Cost of therapy needed to get over the crushing reality that catgirls don't actually exist: $125000  Overall $210010 well spent.  Cardiac arrest/9
The animation for the Nekos in this visual novel is so cute , I love it. And it is voiced in Japanese with Japanese , English and Traditional Chinese Sub.  Never regret buying this game and hope there's more games with English and Chinese subtittles.
MY IMMORTAL DICK IS ONCE AGAIN ON FIRE AND CANNOT BE STOPPED.
This VN is just... That thing right above amazing and incredible. I love the animations (personally, kept chest bounciness on a low setting), and those coupled with amazing voice acting and a very good story are an amazing combination. Anyone who likes VNs should definitely get this one.  The only negative thing I can think about, is that it lacks a windowed fullscreen option. Seriously. When I went into the options menu, I can change the volume level of invidual characters, text speed, auto skip, auto skip text speed, etc.  I haven't followed Neko Paradise anywhere else, but "Vol. 1" obviously tells me that we will hear more about these lovely girls in the future too.  Some may think that the 10€ price tag is high for a visual novel but I think this one was well worth it, with it's amazing voice actors, cute characters and a lovely story. Overall I think this VN is one of the best, if not the best I have ever gotten my hands on, and believe me I play a lot of VNs. I might even replay this game a few times to pass the time until "Vol. 2."  9.9/10 just because no windowed fullscreen.  Vanilla <3  [spoiler]Oh yeah and there's an R-18 rated version which you can find on DLsite.com. Will not link because steam rules.[/spoiler]
Has a meter to adjust how much breasts bounce.  Game of the year: 2014
yes.
I usually don't write reviews when I didn't finish the game but holy crap, this is by FAR the cutest game I have ever played <3
Kyaaaaaaaaa~ Moe lv 10000 :3 But must needs Steam training cards :3 i'm want PARANEKO steam profile background :3
Nothing better than Vanilla hentai ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nekos in boxes. What more can you ask for? More Nekos? A Harem of Nekos? Being able to adjust chest bounciness to cater to your "needs"? Check, check, and check!
Meow this is what I would consider a VN for mewcomers. Don't paws on purchasing this or catastrophic things will happen. I have a gut feline that you enjoy it. I'm not lion, this game is a purrfect piece of litter-ature.
"My life is complete        Nothing else could compare         Receiving number one Reaching new heights in technology          Realizing one's dream          Is not worth to beauty  of this game on my monitor screen."
its a nekopara its cat paradise suit for cat lover and dozen of moe inside i recommend it!
God Damn... Cant get enough of these game! im only at chapter 2 lol
The visual novel has some great humor and sentimental aspects throughout: with fantastic depth of characters as well. The UI and animations of this VN is finely well done. Amazing game and is very recommended for those who enjoy visual novels ^_^
If you like catgirls and reading, this is a must buy
I'm really on the fence on this game! This VN is ok....It's not worth the price to be honest. Good -Very good art! -Funny as heck....I laughed so hard at a few parts. -Extra animation for the girls were a very nice touch. I would love to see this on new VN -Story has good parts. -Makes you look forward for the next part! Cons -Story is ok heart warming yes. Not much drama as I though there would be. -This is a nick pick but the sound effects when something happens are kinda out of place of this VN. -I wish you change choose what to do next! -They should done some mini game with the baking. -The story kinda makes you weird after thinking about it. Even how light hearted the story is. Just some of it makes you feel weird. It's like a MGS 2 feeling lol. -SHORT! It took me 3 hours to go through the whole VN. Extras shouldn't be called extras because it's just story concent they played. (I played the demo before skiping 1/3 of it)  Overview: A fun time killer but wanting more at the end. Oh ecchi only sorry if you looking for more. Meaning youtube safe! Shockingly no swears! Any other question please message me!  Fun score: Insect sex out of 10 ;) Final Score: 6 out of 10
[h1]You[/h1] know you want it ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
This game is like thinking you will get a new five thousand dollar PC but to your later realization, you actually got a 10 dollar game full of catgirls , and it makes you feel more happy than getting 50 dollars worth of steam credit. 11/10
10/10. The characters are so adorable!
Chocolate > Vanilla  If you think otherwise you have bad taste sry
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmoe
because a catgirl is fine too
a cat is fine too
"Hey! Hey! Master, what's men-stroo-al pain? Ah, could men-stroo-al pain be... It's the pain in your muscles when your cleaning, right?!"  -Chocola 2k14  As a female I can confirm this.  10/10
The game makes you to lose your virginity to multiple cat girls. There's no way you avoid can avoid it, it's forced on you. It honestly felt like I was being ﻿ＲＡＰＥＤ. 10/10
What a time to be alive. That was my first thought when I saw this game on steam. Worth every penny 10/10 Vanilla is my waifu.
ＳＵＰＥＲ　ＮＹＡＭＡＺＩＮＧ！！
kawaii af  lock your door when you're playing this
Take some of the best artwork by NEKO WORKS/Sayori, The best catgirl masocts ever and throw them into a feels-full VN. You have NEKOPARA Vol. 1.   This VN is like a roller coaster of feels, Never really going down into deep gut-tearing pain but rather going up with feels and only to go down enough to skyrocket you up with love and affection for these catgirls. Plus as everyone who knows the artwork as well as anyone who goes to any of the Borru sites would be excited to see Sayori's artwork come to life with the E-Mote engine(?) in play. I highly recommend this VN for anyone a fan of either the artwork, feels, or just catgirls in general.
Finally it is released .........  been waiting for long time XD
If you love cats, and I love beauty Good.
Nyaaaa! Nyaanyaanyaa!!!! Nyaaaaaaaaa! *collapses from cute catgirl overload*
waited for this to release all day, i counted down i hours  and what do i get? neko girls with an adjustible breast bounce slide also, press P for bonus bounces
Can't play while family is in the room out of shame.  10/10

You are this dude who is the owner of a bakery and two catgirls who help you out around the shop whilst catgirl antics ensue. How is this not a win?

sold my useless 3d cat to come up with the money for this game  10/10 definitely worth
NEKOPARA Vol.1 is the first in what I assume will be a series of short visual novels with the aim of making its readers melt with pleasure using a vast and varied array of female, feline, humanoid companions armed with cuteness and, well, catness. One of the first things I realized after starting the VN was that I was most definitely not the target audience for the title, which makes reviewing it a little difficult. While I personally didn’t enjoy the ride, it accomplishes everything it set out to do and does it reasonably well, so I’m going to attempt to cover both sides of the coin to give you an idea of whether this is a story that will appeal to you.  Minaduki Kashou has had enough of his family. Despite belonging to a long line of Japanese sweet makers, he would love nothing more than to open his own bakery, which is what he sets out to do. Just as he is about to complete his goal, however, he receives two unexpected guests in the form of his sister’s Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, couriered to him along with the rest of his luggage. Catgirls are, as they sound, female cats in humanoid form, with all of the cuteness you might expect from the mix. If taught well, they can speak and operate almost as well as a normal person, so in this day and age many people have taken them on as “Catpanions”. They’re a massive responsibility, though, and Kashou just isn’t sure he can handle the two while opening his new store. However, the Catgirls aren’t going to give up without a fight and Kashou may soon find a place in his heart and his home for the young felines.  If any of that summary doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, it isn’t. NEKOPARA is a dedicated moege (game intended to be cute) catering to a specific audience and doesn’t aim to appeal to anyone outside of that field. It spends all its energy on the simple goal of displaying cute characters doing cute things, which it does well, so if that’s your cup of tea then it would probably be a fantastic experience. Even though I’m more of a fan of titles with heavy story components I still found myself smiling and laughing during the experience, and I have to acknowledge that the Catgirls are pretty darned cute, so you can be sure that it would be that much more enjoyable to someone who’s into the genre. Speaking of story, there’s really not much to NEKOPARA’s. It’s short, sharp, and doesn’t try to do a whole lot except at the very end in a chapter that seems rushed and anticlimactic. In short, if you don’t think that Catgirls doing cute things are enough to hold up a visual novel on their own, NEKOPARA isn’t for you.  Characterization is as shallow as you might expect it to be, with the heroines showcasing a single personality trait each in addition to the necessary devotion to their owner. That said, there are a range of both humans and Catgirls involved in the tale, with a greater role for the non-main heroines looking likely in future instalments, which is more than enough to accomplish what NEKOPARA sets out to do. I want to take a moment now to discuss the VN’s classification, because it will be important for some potential players. The Steam release that I played is “censored”, meaning that scenes considered R18 have been removed. The odd thing is that borderline nudity, explicit talk about sex and obviously skipped over sex scenes are all still included in the final package. Given that anyone purchasing the Steam version is going to get all that anyway, if you’re after a cute, all-ages moege then that’s just tough, and if you’re after that stuff then why the heck would you buy the Steam version?  One of NEKOPARA’s major selling points is its visuals and they’re worth all of the hype. Character design is great and sprites will talk, blink, tilt their heads, walk around the screen and more. Allowing the animations to complete was a reason in itself for letting each character finish talking rather than continuing on after reading each line, as it gave a depth to the characters that their personalities didn’t. While most of the dynamic sprite features run smoothly, I noticed a bit of lag when the sprites change to new positions or poses without using animation, which was jarring and a little disappointing considering the overall polish of the visual novel. The voice actors perform as well as is usual for Japanese productions and the BGM is also standard fare. One final feature that I find really cool is that you can choose to play in either English or Japanese, which makes the game a great resource for people wanting to practice either language.  Summary – NEKOPARA Vol.1 isn’t for me but for its target audience it could be a lot of fun. The technologically impressive visuals mix with cute, fun characters to deliver a solid moege. If it doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, however, it probably isn’t, as it lacks any sort of compelling story or character development. It’s worth noting that the Steam release isn’t really “all ages”, so if you’re after something innocent then you may want to look elsewhere also.  My Score: 6/10 – Average Projected Score for Target Audience: 8/10 – Good
i bought it because i always masturbate to it on gelbooru
买买买，不买不是人 Buy buy buy, ones that do not buy are not gentlemen
Im not a weaboo I swear :^)
This...This game. HOLY SHIT I LOVE THIS GAME! NEKOS!!!!!! MOE!!!!! UNLIMITED MOEBETES WORKS!!!!! It's amazing, and definitely worth the buy. It was a long wait for it, but it was definitely worth said wait! 11/10 would play again.

Vanilla is best girl :^)
i came i saw i conquered and i cant go back
For years I begged my parents to let me get a real cat and, for all those years, they always said no. Now, I don’t need one anymore. I’m sure they’ll be happy that I discovered Nekopara, right? d(=^･^ =)
And thus, my descent into darkness begins... No regrets 10/10
This is Meowtastic   11/10
Lost my virginity.  10/10
This game is my wife <3
what are all these nekos doing in my house?????
NEKOPARA is a thrilling story about the adventure of an up and coming Japanese confection maker, Kashou Minaduki, and how he struggles to make sweetie sweets and make his business thrive. In this sense, it is very much like Naruto because it is about how our main character overcomes the challenges presented to him. Naruto overcomes his curse and accepts his fate as a human.  Kashou overcomes the bonds of sexual taboo and dives into the deep depths of bestiality with catgirls.
Kept refreshing the store page to buy this, i love the manga. So there is NO reason for not to love the visual novel. Do keep in mind, this is the none adult version, so if you want to get it, get on the website for it.  9/10  eNjoy ^-^
It has Nekos in it.  10/10.
First off try the demo before buying. I did and it was the reason why I bought this. The game shows a follow tale of catgirls and their master. Now this game has a nice feel to it others don't provde. Like Live2d motion you have for the Ipad being instilled on this work. The characters move, blink, and react. They keep on screen and make good reactions with their expressions. The character work wasn't wasted. There is continuity and fluid movement. That is the heavy emphasis I saw. Nonetheless the tale takes a nice well drawn turn with many more introduced to the story. It goes on and out introducing more and each one showing their little bit of character. The two cats you have Chocola and Vanilla. These two are constantly in this story and have their interests with you. There are fun moments with more of the cast and the voices are synced. There are ways to change language just look at guides. Also the game supports English, Chinese, and Japanese Language with subtitles. The voice is what did well by it and the expressions I canot deny are cute. The telling of the story is good. OUT OF 10. This would be a 10. Thanks to the sense of this visual novel being able to give more. There is another version. However as of Vol 1. This thing hit top of my chart this year. Not a bad way to end 2014 ^_^ I enjoyed it.  If you get it now, I tell you won't regret it. This offered something other VNs lacked. Sure there's CG but you got to play it for yourself. I won't spoil it but it is good. The characters are all admirable in thier own way. Those who made it deserve the 10 as well kudos to you. Fans of this genre and game bro fist to you. Enjoy as I have ^_^
Neko/10 plz~
